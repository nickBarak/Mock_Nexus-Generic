Not long ago, she was simply perceived as an international college student. Now she is labeled a Chinese student from Wuhan –– the origin of the disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The imperceptible potential of contracting</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus, as well as the rate of propagation, are disturbing. Because the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virus can have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\">an incubation period</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\"> of up to 14 days</a>, people are traveling abroad without awareness that they are infected. This boosts the spread of the disease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, there is a great deal of criticism toward Chinese people, as they are being blamed for bringing the virus into new countries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend admitted that she has been upset by certain interactions on our own campus. Even though she returned to school in early January, when the disease had just begun to spread, her family and friends are still in Wuhan. “There is nothing I can do, except tell them to wear masks,” she recalled. She said she feels helpless and is deeply concerned for her family and friends. The harmful comments that she has observed on the news and social media posts have depressed her further. The news blames people from Wuhan for consuming exotic animals and traveling during this time period. </span>My friend feels disappointed when she notices the people around her acting extremely cautious, as if she herself is some kind of virus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It hurts,” my friend confessed. “People should not generalize and attribute the virus to the whole Chinese population.” She pointed out that “there are restaurants refusing to allow Chinese people in.” While it is true that the disease originated from China, extrapolating this to all Chinese people is not a productive reaction. </span>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another,”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was both surprised by and sympathetic to what my friend from Wuhan has encountered. The response of unfair overgeneralization hurts people’s feelings. As a Chinese student myself, this is especially disheartening to hear about. Next time you meet an international student, throw away the stereotypes and maybe take a moment to learn about who they really are. If they are a Chinese student from Wuhan, ask them, “How are your parents? Is your family doing okay?” or simply respond with a hug. That would be sweet. I hope our world can become better with a little respect and a lot of empathy, because sometimes a little consideration goes a long way. </span></p>\n<p><em>– Jessica Kuo</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara students should not be overly paranoid about coronavirus spreading to our campus. First of all, since the disease originated in China, the only way for the virus to get to Santa Barbara would be from a community member traveling to and from China. As most UCSB faculty and students returned from winter break before the virus was discovered, we are not at high risk of contraction. Santa Barbara doesn’t have an international airport and it isn’t an overly popular tourist city. There is very little chance that the citizens here have been exposed to the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/18/world/18reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most airlines have recently canceled flights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between China and other countries. The federal government has also </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/02/05/travel-restrictions-tied-coronavirus-stall-travel-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enacted a new policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that all tourists from China must be quarantined and observed for 14 days, which is the extent of the incubation period of the virus, before they can leave and go about their business. The last two cases in California have been confined and quarantined to hospitals. The virus is still far away from us. It is an overreaction to ask for our campus to be shut down.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the chances of exposure to coronavirus are very low, we cannot presume our community is a completely safe zone. Along with coronavirus, there are also several kinds of influenza circulating in the U.S. Students should wear masks to protect themselves from catching the flu from public areas, especially in crowded places, such as the library or large lecture halls. Since some symptoms of these flus are similar to the coronavirus infection, people who have a fever, cough and breathing difficulties should visit Student Health and receive a diagnosis for their illness. After that, they should avoid going to crowded places or talking to other people without a mask because the flu is also highly contagious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, for students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks. All we mask-wearers want to do is keep viruses and disease from spreading. Please do not laugh at people wearing masks or insult them for doing so. Be friendly and sympathetic and let hope fill our campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hondong Huang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Chinese international student who wants to pursue a career in health, I have to raise my voice: The epidemic is not an excuse to be racist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am fortunate to have not yet personally experienced any racial prejudice at UC Santa Barbara. However, my best friend, who studies at Emerson College in Boston, was verbally assaulted by a couple of strangers because she is Asian and wore a mask. Also, some of my non-Chinese friends have told me that their parents have advised them to stay away from Chinese people. I was shocked and saddened to hear that people would start to blame and fear an entire ethnicity during this health emergency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these people fail to realize that the Chinese are just as afraid as everyone else — or possibly even more afraid. We are scared and sad because our friends, families and the cities we were raised in are struggling during this catastrophe. Right now, it’s the Lunar New Year, which is the equivalent of the winter holidays for Western cultures, the time of year for family reunions and to spread love and support. However, this year people are quarantined, separated and facing discrimination. The social stigma against Chinese people is growing worse, and when people are quick to blame, fewer are inclined to help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chinese are not a public threat; the virus and those exposed to the outbreak are. This is not an issue of ethnicity, religion, physical appearance, gender, geography or nationality. This is simple science: it’s about a virus spreading among humans and affecting people’s health. This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim. Racial prejudice born of this epidemic isolates Chinese people, causing whoever is experiencing symptoms to hide their illness, contributing further to the public health crisis. So stop blaming an entire segment of the population and instead help protect our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information about the evolving coronavirus epidemic is being clearly and effectively conveyed to the public. As a part of this community, it’s our responsibility to get information from reliable sources and stop panicking. Don’t hate or judge people of Chinese ethnicity. Keep up with the news, focus on the facts and advocate for public health to actively protect our community.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Enjia Zhang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wuhan is known to have a large exotic meat market, which is why the virus is thought to have originated from one of the animals sold at the market. It was originally thought that the virus could only be spread from direct contact with an infected animal. However, as more information about coronavirus comes to light, researchers have concluded that this disease can also spread from human contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As densely populated areas, Isla Vista and the UC Santa Barbara campus are prime locations for diseases to spread; coronavirus is no exception. However, there is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic. It is crucial that the UCSB community stays up to date with accurate information about the virus in order to remain safe and healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact. It is still unclear whether or not the virus can be passed through touch, such as by touching a surface that an infected person has also touched. Because of the nature of the disease, it is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and often — especially before and after coming into contact with your face, eyes or nose.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another crucial step that UCSB students can take to prevent the spread of this virus is staying home when they are sick and avoiding close contact with others who are sick with any illness. If the sickness persists, it is imperative to visit a doctor. While the odds of contracting coronavirus in this area are extremely low, early diagnosis can be key in disease prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the measures that should be taken to prevent a possible case of coronavirus are essentially the same measures that should be taken to avoid any common contagious virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the most up-to-date information, UCSB students should consult credible websites such as that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or speak with their local health care providers. If the public is well-informed and aware of the symptoms and proper preventative measures, it will be easier for health care providers to treat and contain the virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there has been much unnecessary hysteria surrounding the outbreak of this disease. To avoid this, well-informed students should pass along reliable information to others. It is important for the community to be educated in order to keep everyone well versed on the nature of the virus. We should encourage friends and peers to watch out for signs and symptoms while simultaneously keeping in mind that these symptoms could be — and most likely are — indicative of any number of viruses. We must also encourage our community members to maintain healthy living habits, such as washing hands and keeping clean living spaces. In doing so, the UCSB community can remain safe and educated on the outbreak of this world health epidemic.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Maya Wohl</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My homeland is severely suffering from coronavirus. People are forced to stay in their homes and are in great danger. As the virus is still being researched, experts and scientists are not yet certain of the modes of transmission or effective treatments. Thus, people must take up their own efforts to defend themselves against it. Many families and individuals in China are now struggling against the fatal virus, including family members of international students here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we are studying in a foreign country, our minds are consumed with our home country. It is extremely distressing to see that our prosperous hometowns are now empty cities, and many factories and schools are being transformed into temporary hospitals. To help our country get through this difficult time, international students have tried our best to transport medical supplies back to China. Among these supplies, masks and protective suits are most important for avoiding further infection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the UCSB campus, the prevalence of mask-wearing has recently led to an increased amount of discrimination. Although I have never personally experienced this, I have witnessed and read about plenty of racist attacks around the world against Chinese people. We want people to know that most of us never lived in the city where the virus originated and that most of us have not been back to China since the outbreak began. We have had no contact with the virus, so there is no reason for Chinese students to be ostracized. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though coronavirus originated in China, Chinese people should not be labeled as ill or contaminated. Coronavirus is a catastrophe for all human beings, not only Chinese people. Mankind must stick together to persist through collective difficulty. Just like Ebola and -CoV, coronavirus is not anyone’s fault — including those who have been infected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, thousands of people were infected by H1N1, or swine flu, a widespread flu which originated in Mexico. However, no one blamed a certain country or race for that pandemic. Though China is working tirelessly to fight against coronavirus and minimize the global death toll, some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese students are wearing face masks as a protective measure, because we don’t want to be infected by other people. We are not sick.  I hope the racist behaviors will stop and we can avoid imposing further psychological harm to Chinese students.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Liuyi Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t look at me like I am some kind of freak!” This is what I want to tell the xenophobic students at UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the outbreak of coronavirus, all Chinese students have been put on high alert: many of them started to wear face masks in order to minimize chances of infection. Some people on campus who may not be aware of the seriousness of the situation seem bothered by Chinese students wearing masks. Holly Smith, an administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator at UCSB, suggested that there is no need for those who have not been infected by the virus to wear masks. Yet, the incubation period, the contagious stage of the virus, can last up to 14 days. The purpose of wearing masks is simply to protect one another from the risk of getting infected. Although there are no confirmed cases at UCSB, it is still necessary to implement preventative methods.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the chance of an outbreak in Santa Barbara is extremely low, Chinese students are not willing to take any chances. I sincerely ask UCSB students to stop being xenophobic toward the virus. We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease. It is indecent for people to discriminate against any racial group, especially during such a sensitive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural differences also account for this misguided attitude toward mask-wearing. Unlike in western cultures, mask-wearing is a common method of illness prevention in China and other Asian countries. Not only do we wear masks during flu season, we also put on face masks whenever we are sick to stop an illness from spreading further. Face masks certainly do a better job of this than sneezing and coughing into an elbow.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth of JJ’s life was obvious. The smile on his face meant what you thought it did, and the concern behind his voice was always genuine. JJ’s life at UCSB was filled with adventure because he knew the value of a life, before his closest friends had to realize it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We lost JJ Sanani on the night of Dec. 13, 2019 — at the end of finals week in fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He smoked Lucky Strikes (no filter) and drank Natty Daddy. He would rock a fit with sandals, too-short running shorts, a colorful shirt, a thick tan overcoat and some shades. When you told him something </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shocking</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he always furrowed his brows and made a concerned face. He grew his hair out all year, and they were long enough where we called them </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worms</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He was taller than everyone, and so he was able to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put his arm around you and he always pulled you closer. He would drop his head down to your level and say, “Listen…” before saying his words after you finished your story. He was a people person. He had love for everyone — himself, his closest friends and the friends that pissed him off most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there was an article written about JJ that did not mention the partying, the author did not know him. In a large crowd, JJ would always be caught with the biggest smile and unmatched excitement. Combining his hair, clothes and height, he was always the first one to be spotted in a crowd and he embraced all of that love. Believe me when I say that JJ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> danced. And since he was so tall, so were his limbs, making him a bit lanky. Nevertheless, the man was able to move his hips (and we all knew it). I, and many others, are thankful that he provided an avenue to enjoy so many rowdy nights out. There is a video I have on my phone where JJ is on the roof wobblin’ so hard you couldn’t miss him. He stayed in his prime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ would never answer his phone when people </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needed to find him. Yes, it was difficult to get a hold of him, but once he locked his eyes on you — he didn’t let you go. JJ has pushed through crowds of people to put his arm around his special people and ask, genuinely, how they are. In those moments, his love showed so much that it melted everything else around him. Only you existed for a few minutes. He was down for the people, the thrill, the memories, all in an effort to battle the fleeting time of college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about living in the moment — the man constantly lost his phone. And his wallet. There were times where we talked about it and he told me that he kinda liked not having his phone because he would avoid distractions. The only way he could tell the time was by listening to the bells of Storke Tower. He was proud of living in the now, without any extra worries. Not only did he survive, but he thrived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For sure, you notice his clothes and his hair, but his smile was beyond words, and you only ever saw it at its fullest. JJ’s truth lived on through his laugh. It’s easy to say that everything could be a joke to JJ, and his infamous chuckle is something that I hope my ears never unhear. He was also able to make you feel like he was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> listening to you. He asked all of the right questions, in the middle of it all. He knew how to console all of his friends, and he was appreciated for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did he listen loudly, but he made sure </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knew he loved us. He made sure to tell me on many occasions how much he loved and trusted me. It helps me to know that so many in Isla Vista got the same kind of treatment. He took the time to have those one-on-one conversations whenever it was needed. I am taking the time, now, to recognize that. I have a vivid memory of standing on his balcony during summer session where he told me something like, “You don’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it Gilbert, I seriously </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seriously</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trust you — and you’re one of the only people I can say I’ve trusted with my life since day one. I don’t think you’ll </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get it dude, you are a special guy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The only person I was glad to have laugh at my problems. In the end, he was always able to bring it back to how tiny we are compared to the universe, and why that means we should just make the most of our life in motion. JJ was a reminder to not let it pass by you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was also known for being very vocal about his values and was not easily persuaded. From topics on religion, politics, education, social life and ethics, we’ve had all of those debates in my old bedroom. The point is that though JJ never really came out on top of those debates; he was humble enough to ask more about it and to concede when it was appropriate. To be able to admit fault and to adapt is rare. During freshman year, he would always get in arguments with our friend Daniel, and I had to come up with a safe word: “dolphins.” Look, a safe word for bickering sounds ridiculous, but it worked. Every. Single. Time. He stayed humble. All of this to say that JJ still fought to the end, with his teeth and his knees. His passion is what we all remember. Those values that he held closest to him, he never let go. He knew what it meant to respect and appreciate those he cared about and stood up against unfairness. It was hard to make him sit down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, JJ was known for being kind and loving. It was a unique love because it was so widespread. I don’t need to mention all of the times I’ve been stopped while we were walking together because everyone wants to say hello. His genuine words with individuals, his spirit filled with fire and his humble admiration for his friends around him is what he leaves for the rest of us. The irony is that my first memories with JJ are about discussing all the adventures that UCSB had to offer us, but JJ did not know that he would end up </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the community itself. JJ’s impact on Isla Vista was larger than he could even imagine, and he would be damn happy to know that he touched so many people.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93502\" style=\"width: 193px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93502\" data-attachment-id=\"93502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-sanani-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=720%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"JJ Sanani 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93502\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2-141x250.jpg?resize=183%2C324\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Section II:</i> A Mosaic – Accounts by those closest</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandon Hanan </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with JJ, he always took a genuine interest in my life and my problems. He always had this profound wisdom he would share with me to uplift my spirits and he knew the right times I needed to hear it. I remember a time back in high school when I was going through a bit of a slump in my life and JJ and I were together hanging out in the backyard of my old house when he expressed to me, “Brandon, you do know that you’re my brother and one of the most unique and charismatic individuals that I have ever met in my life, right? I mean, that’s why so many people love you.”  That statement hit me so hard I remember it to this day and it changed my whole perspective of who I am as a person. He just knew what to say and when to say it. No one else could give me those types of inspirational pep talks like JJ did because no one really knew me like he did. His uniqueness, selflessness, wisdom and authenticity amazed me throughout our friendship. He also had a catchphrase he would always say to me that described his life so perfectly, which was “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c’est la vie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meaning, “that’s life.” JJ always lived life to the fullest, fearless of risks and valued human connection with every single person he came in contact with. I would be a bit nervous about JJ organizing my bachelor party, but I used to always tell him that he was going to be the best man at my wedding. I knew regardless that he is my best man and will always be in my heart. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not about having anxiety for the future or regret from the past. It’s about living fully, like JJ did, in the present moment in our lives.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kasimir Tan</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon first impression, JJ was notable for his good looks, his sense for cynical — yet truthful —humor, his nice smile and his unquestionably good sense of style. But one way that he really stood out in our community of Isla Vista was in his listening skills.  In our modern day of technology and distractions, you will rarely come across a person who had the listening skills that JJ had. I always really enjoyed talking to him because a conversation with him was always rich. He was generally interested in what the people around him thought regarding deep subjects, such as the state of the world, science, religion and theology.  Whether he knew you for days or years, he could engage with almost anyone at any time and make them feel that he was truly thinking about their words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really appreciated this quality of his when I was his roommate. Over the nine months that I lived with him, we got into some quarrels as roommates often do.  Though at some points we wanted to bite each other’s heads off, we almost always could come to some conclusion and better understanding of one another that would help us resolve our issues.  I think we both realized that oftentimes the anger we expressed at one another had sources that were external to our relationship, and that through discussing our issues, we understood each other better and the anger dissolved.  One profound way in which he expressed his understanding was when I would call him out on his bullshit. After explaining to him why I thought his behavior was immoral or why it was bothering me, sometimes he would say, “You’re right, I’ll do better next time.”  I’ve never met anyone who could admit fault like he could and who had the humility to tell someone else they were right when he realized they saw he was wrong. As I got to know him more and more, I really felt that he was one of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truest</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends I had in my time at UCSB.  Though it didn’t always seem like it through his flaws,  I came to realize that he genuinely cared for all the people that were a part of his life, and he showed that he cared through how he spoke and listened to people.  I really liked that he had this quality, which is so rare these days. When I think of him, I miss the pleasant and unpleasant conversations we used to have. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Put down your phone to listen to what the people physically around you say, and try to understand where they are coming from. This is a positive quality that will help you make others feel special in our modern world.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilbert Nazari </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met JJ on the first day that we moved into Anacapa Hall, and it has been an adventure and friendship I could never expect. Coming to terms with such a loss, I can at least grab onto those moments where he told me, “I trust you more than anyone else out here.” He was able to share those moments of truth when I didn’t know I needed them. I will never forget how intensely JJ would introduce me to the people that were around him. Since I missed a year of college, I was always behind with meeting so many mutual friends, but JJ never stopped introducing me with fire in his words. He would tell people “I love this guy more than anyone!” or “You don’t know how lucky you are to meet Gilbert.” The passion in those introductions is something I’ll never forget. He’d wrap his long arms around my neck just to share me with his friends — making connections. Even his own backyard party where there were too many heads to count, when he saw my face in the crowd, he went after me. And he stayed so passionate about speaking beauty of his friends that I can’t forget it myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you love someone enough, you let them know. And when you introduce them to the friends you love, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduce them like your life depends on it.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isa Guilfoyle</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, I’d run into JJ and, no matter how much time had passed, or what he had going on, he made me feel important and cared for. I think the thing he would tell me the most was just to relax, that I worried too much about everything. JJ taught me so much about how to enjoy life even when everything seems to be going wrong, because JJ knew that life was a gift and he wasn’t going to waste it. Even though we grew apart as life got in the way and sometimes weeks would go by without us seeing each other, every time we did, it went the same way. He’d show his big, toothy smile and shake his head, looking up to the sky with that carefree laugh, then he’d scoop me up in his arms and hug me tight enough so I could smell the stog he was probably smoking a few minutes before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time during our sophomore year, we ran into each other like this and JJ seemed especially excited. He started telling me about a class that he knew I would absolutely love because the majority of the work was done playing at recess with elementary schoolers. JJ and I would dream about being pediatricians together our freshman year of college. He reminded me of this and had me convinced. I remember the first time I went to a recess with him. To this day, I have never seen kids </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excited to play with someone. Within a few seconds, the kindergarteners had climbed up and all over him. He had kids hanging from his arms, holding onto his legs, climbing onto his front and back and a few ran circles around him. He just looked at me and smiled so big. JJ was completely content; he loved these kids just as much as they loved him. The sight of a JJ jungle gym was so funny, and such a pure representation of who JJ was. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Take care of those that you love and always let them know. JJ would carry you until his back broke and smile about it. He would make you laugh until you cried, or stop crying because you were laughing too hard. He’d call you out when you needed it but knew how to distract you. He was a true friend beyond space and time, and he will be forever missed. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Harano</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ and I had many great memories which I will cherish for the rest of my life. I will always miss that amazing sense of humor, his inquisitive mind, his wonderful outlook on the world and the people he shared it with. Through the way he lived, he taught us all so much about how important it is to have a positive attitude and how that positivity can encourage those around you. The most important thing I learned from JJ, however, did not come from one of those great moments I was able to share with him. Instead, it came after one of the worst arguments I’ve had with a close friend. JJ was always incredibly sensitive to the feelings of others and was deeply in tune with his own feelings. That being said, one time he and I had a horrible argument where we hurt each other’s feelings and said some terribly damaging things to one another. However, in an act that was truly reflective of his character, JJ came into my room the next morning and told me that he was still deeply upset with what was said between us but more importantly, he said that he genuinely cherished our friendship and that our relationship meant more to him than anything that happened the night before while letting me know he still loved me deeply. JJ always sought to make things alright with everyone and was willing to put his friends above himself in all cases. He displayed an emotional maturity and deep level of caring for those around him that is simply invaluable and somewhat rare for people our age. No matter the instance, he sought to be the best person he could be and made a genuine effort to bring light and happiness to those around them. He never shied away from being the bigger person in order to preserve what he cared about more than anything else — his friendships and relationships with those he loved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> JJ taught us to love deeply and to do everything you do with your entire heart, to be genuine with those around you and most importantly, to never let anything get in the way of spending time with those you love. It is because of this beautiful legacy that JJ will reign forever in our minds and our hearts. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nick Lombardi</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been 89 days and from time to time, I still forget that you are gone. When I watch the sunset and remember the raw conversations we had, I think of you. When I see someone trying so hard to become a better version of themself than they were the day before, I think of you</span><b>. When I see someone who is hurting but tries to run from their pain by loving others harder, I think of you</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The expression we had for you was “tell me you love me.” This quote was so perfectly representative of who you were: an expression that showed your vulnerability, but also your strength. You weren’t afraid of talking about topics like love with me. You showed me the importance of not being afraid to share your true emotions with both those you love and those you had just met. By doing this, you were able to create a bond that was individually special, raw and unique to each person you talked to. You had a way of pushing my buttons just hard enough to see how deep I could go. You weren’t afraid of seeing my pain, but instead, you would often seek it out just so you could show me that I wasn’t alone through it. You pushed me through stuff I didn’t want to deal with because you truly cared about me. Finally, JJ, you taught me how to love unconditionally, through all of the darkness. You are forever in my heart.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you I loved you enough when I could have. When I see you up there, you won’t have to ever say our quote again. Until then, with my whole heart, I love you buddy. Rest easy, brother.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don’t be afraid to smile in the face of your own vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Josh Lewczyk</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was the first person that I met at UCSB and living with him in the dorms our first year was an experience I’ll never forget. Going into college, I knew that JJ and our other roommate, Jack, had been good friends since high school. I was definitely worried that I would be the odd man out, but JJ put that fear to rest on the first day that I met him. Talking to JJ was always so easy, even if the subject matter got serious, and he quickly became my closest friend at UCSB. I started freshman year as an introvert, but JJ helped me get out of my comfort zone and I met most of my close friends through him. I remember my favorite moments with him were late at night when we would sit by the lagoon and just talk about all the crazy stuff happening to us. There was this spot that we would chill at almost every night that looked right over the water. We were there after my first breakup and after my first failed college class, and he was always so quick to remind me of all the good stuff happening in our lives. He was just such an easygoing person that it was hard to stay upset around him. JJ was a true friend and he helped me get through some of the toughest moments of my life. I honestly don’t know what I would have done without him.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we are going through right now is only temporary and in no way defines us.  We are in one of the most beautiful places in the world right now, with some beautiful people — let’s make the most of it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daniel Gitlin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and most important thing you need to understand about my relationship with JJ is that we never agreed. Not on a single issue. But, for some reason, that strengthened our relationship more than any commonality could ever have. We were diametrically opposed and yet, two sides of the same coin; fundamentally, I think, we were somehow the same person, striving for the same goals, haunted by the same fears, but manifested in two wildly different personalities. That’s why JJ was my best friend, because no one understood me, or people, better than him. No one could wrap you around his finger, or build you up from dark places, like JJ. No matter how angry we might have been at each other, no matter how frustrated and high-strung from balancing our S.T.E.M. education with daily degeneracy, JJ and I always bonded through debates about art, religion, philosophy, our lives, marriage and the meaning of happiness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of my memories about JJ from our sophomore year revolve around our room. We had the deepest — and often most heated — talks of our relationship in that room, amongst mountains of his unending laundry and a littering of my various foodstuffs. Seated on a cigarette-stained futon with our feet propped on a posh leather footrest stolen from God-knows-where, our hopelessly broken windows streaming in afternoon light and the ocean breeze, we poured our hearts out. I specifically remember one of those afternoons: The conversation was more or less a rerun of talks we’d had before, until one of us decided to play music on our “shared” bar speaker. It evolved into an arrangement of our favorite songs, a wispy reflection of our lives as LA-born, beach-town college kids. A dash of Frank Ocean, some of JJ’s favorite Bob Marley, RHCP and then, for the climax, the bittersweet beauty of “Hotel California” by the Eagles. As we mouthed the lyrics and air-strummed Joe Walsh’s power chords, it became a song that so perfectly captured the crescendo of our lives.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entranced by an ephemeral dream, drawn in by a beautiful woman, and ensnared in a seemingly ceaseless cycle of partying, remorse, abstinence and partying.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We imagined this world we’d built as a tautology, a prison. But the kind of prison that life would be meaningless without. Every time I think of JJ, I think of him as the patron saint of the Hotel California, something like flame incarnate: so bright and frenetic and hopelessly confined, yet, somehow, so unabashedly free.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love life, and all of life’s people, in the most essential form. In spite of our tendency to love conditionally — because of our goals, purpose, good luck or motives — JJ knew, more than anyone I ever met, why we need to love life and people </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unconditionally</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — for their intrinsic and ungraspable beauty.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93505\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93505\" data-attachment-id=\"93505\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93505\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3-250x167.jpg?resize=365%2C244\" alt=\"\" width=\"365\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93505\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Section III:</i> Isla Vista Memorial by Nick Lombardi</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memorial we had for you brought out over 400 people that you left an impact on in your three-and-a-half years here at UCSB.

Thank you for your beautiful gift of bringing entire communities together through your love. You helped teach me what community truly is. You helped teach us that we are not alone in our struggles. You helped teach us what being there for one another really means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really difficult planning the memorial for JJ. It did not require a massive amount of work but given the situation, it was the only thing on my mind for those three weeks leading up to it. There was so much support from the community, all just wanting to contribute and honor the man we miss so much. I set up a Facebook event page and helped decide exactly what we wanted to do for him. I had no clue what a memorial should look like or what we were even going to do at first, but as I kept thinking about it, I realized the message behind it was the community unity and support for each other.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93503\" style=\"width: 393px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93503\" data-attachment-id=\"93503\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93503\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2-250x167.jpg?resize=383%2C256\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because he passed away right as school was out, most people heard about the news when they were alone or with family. I was so thankful to have been with my father at the time, but what I needed and was missing was to be with my housemates and those who knew him. That month was agonizing, knowing that so many of us had to get through this loss without the support of one another right there. By the time of the memorial, I feel like it was difficult for a lot of people to reopen the wound. Within literal minutes of when we asked people to show up at our house, the entire house was shoulder-to-shoulder packed with JJ’s loved ones. From the house, we walked down the street with each person carrying a lit candle. It was something I will never forget. 400 strong, we were able to show the support we had for one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memorial was for JJ, but in a way, it was more a way to show that we, as a community, had each other to lean back on. To cry and to just love one another. To show each other that this was not something anyone should get through by themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we arrived at the bluffs overlooking Devereux Point, I told the group that this was a time to just be unified together. A friend of JJ’s named Peyton and I set up blankets prior to the group arriving. Whether people wanted to share funny stories or the way he impacted their lives, they were free to do so. However, I told them that if they just wanted to sit there in silence and just grieve with one another, that was so okay also. Some people spoke, but some of it was silence and an overwhelming feeling of love. We cried and just held onto one another.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93504\" style=\"width: 354px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93504\" data-attachment-id=\"93504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93504\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-250x167.jpg?resize=344%2C230\" alt=\"\" width=\"344\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93504\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the front, I got a slab of plywood that I painted white.

It would have been easier to not think about and not face, but that is not what this community did. I am so proud to say that this is the community JJ surrounded himself with. A community that was there for him in the hardest of times. To all that were there, I am so thankful that you loved him well. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/","id":5714,"author":{"id":805,"name":"The Opinions Staff"},"related":[5713,5712,5711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"To the Class of 2020","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/class-2020-e1584658582728.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/class-2020-e1584658582728.jpg?resize=650%2C529&ssl=1","description":"Three years and seven months ago, no one could have imagined that this would be the end to our undergraduate careers.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2020:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years and seven months is the time that we spent at UC Santa Barbara. Three years and seven months ago we moved into our freshman dorms, entering a brand-new chapter of our lives. I remember feeling annoyed that I would be crammed in a room with three others, but now, I would trade my single room for anything. I remember being so nervous to find new friends, but now, I can’t imagine a life without them. I remember feeling anxious about the next four years; now, I feel regret for the three months that were taken away from us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years and seven months ago, no one could have imagined that this would be the end to our undergraduate careers. There was no way to predict that something so fatal would single-handedly put a halt to the regular operations of universities, businesses, travel and countries all around the world.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But over the course of the past week, we watched as COVID-19 slowly ended many of our aspirations and goals.

We won’t be going to Davidson Library, Campbell Hall or the Rec Cen anymore. We might not even be walking at our commencement ceremony in front of all our friends and family. All of those promises we held out for until our last year, the bucket list items that we promised our freshman-year selves to complete by the end of senior year, will now go unfulfilled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting here in self-quarantine, I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and reminisce. At first, I was angry: angry at myself, my housemates, the university, the government, you name it. Then I just felt sad. I thought about all the goodbyes I didn’t get to say, all the faces I might not ever see again, all the places I may never get to bike to. But after riding out this rollercoaster of emotions, I think back on my years at UCSB and I am so, so, so happy. There is no other university where I would have wanted to spend my three years and seven months at, no other people that I would have wanted to share my college memories with, and there is simply nowhere like Isla Vista, no other place I would’ve wanted to live in. My college experience showed me how to love myself and others, that work and play can coexist and that strangers can become friends overnight. If it weren’t for UCSB and the people that I met along the way, I wouldn’t be the person who I am today. For that, I am forever grateful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2021 and the classes to come, take this as an opportunity to reflect on your college experience. Fulfill the promises that you made to yourself sooner than later. Don’t hesitate to introduce yourself to that stranger in your class you always make eye contact with. Don’t opt for nights in bed instead of nights spent with your friends. Don’t leave your bucket list untouched until the last quarter and, most definitely, do not convince yourself that winter quarter has to be boring. Don’t leave it all until the end because you never know if that opportunity will be taken from you. Life is precious, yet unrelenting, so cherish it always.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2020, I am saddened by the way that our time at UCSB has come to an end, but I am even more saddened by the global pandemic that has taken away people’s lives and livelihoods. This pandemic will go on to affect more than just our college careers; it will affect people for years to come. As a collective group, it is important for us to understand that we have the power to help alleviate this crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us are fortunate that we have UCSB, family and friends as our support systems because many people going through this do not. We are fortunate that we had three years and seven months to build a strong support system that we can lean on during this difficult and hectic time. Let’s use this opportunity to stay aware, educated and informed and to act with compassion, patience and love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending love from my quarantined room

This is the first time since 2012 that two individuals from the same school won the decathlon and heptathlon at home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the multis, the Gauchos closed out a great regular season with both men’s and women’s teams defeating Cal Poly in the Cal Poly Dual. The men’s team defeated the rival Mustangs with a score of 104-97, while the women outpaced them with a score of 104-98.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have been consistently improving throughout the season with many members setting new personal records, or PRs, and also cementing themselves in UCSB history by breaking school records. Junior Chloe Cox placed herself 10th overall in the 3000 meter steeplechase with a time of 10:49.94, and Bender had yet another record to break placing her 5th overall in our 400m record with a time of 54.68s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning at home was absolutely as special as I have ever imagined, and having friends and teammates there who don’t usually get to watch the multi was even more amazing,” Bender said. “Getting to close out my Big West heptathlon career with a win was icing on the cake and a huge boost going into the weekend.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bender’s success can be attributed to her hard work and dedication throughout her running career, as well as her drive to improve that has existed since her high school days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “[My passion] started out in high school when I realized that the harder I worked, the faster I got, and that become kind of addicting,” Bender said. “I love training, and even on the long and hard days I love walking away with a sense of accomplishment and like I got better on that day. I think that’s what keeps me going: little victories each and every practice </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Sam Pica also had a strong performance during the Bryan Clay invitation, placing second only behind Nelson. He translated this performance with a 5th-place finish in the multis this past weekend, but look for him to make his mark in the 4×400 and the long jump. Bender already holds the majority of the women’s track and field records, but look for her to close out her last Big West tournament with a bang.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The success the team has had throughout the season has been remarkable. The season is slowly coming to a close, but expect them to represent the school with pride and fight for the championship.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.
