I had expressed interest in playing football, but my parents had wanted me to take some form of self-defense classes and threw me into the United Studios of Self Defense — a mixture of Kung-fu and Shaolin Kempo Karate.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 10 years I spent doing martial arts, I saw many people from every walk of life come and go, but most of the concrete figures in the dojo were men. Being a young girl in a male-dominated sport certainly had its ups and downs. It could be incredibly disheartening to feel lesser than my peers simply because of our biological differences, but by that same notion, it was incredibly empowering to feel just as accomplished, if not more so, than the boys.</p>\n<p>It is really disorienting to be put on a pedestal for your gender when you’re six years old. As a child I lacked the self-awareness to realize it, but ultimately it became clear as I grew older that every time I stepped into the dojo, I was representing my entire gender. Being a spokesperson for all women — specifically young women — was a huge burden to bear, and I constantly felt as though I had to prove myself in the name of my gender. Prior to my time in karate, I had only done activities that aligned with my gender, like ballet, gymnastics and an all-girls soccer league. But in this space I was an outlier, completely outnumbered by boys.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up in the dojo played an interesting role in the development of my mental health. Meditation played a big role in karate: Every class and private lesson started and ended with a moment of meditation. Mindfulness and a clear headspace were always preached, but at the same time, being in a male-dominated space had a big impact on my state of mind. Acting too much “like a girl” was a disadvantage, and the effort to suppress the feminine aspects of my personality was both mentally and emotionally taxing. I hated crying in front of the boys, and ultimately I became too scared to do things that would leave me in a vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>After getting punched in the face at a tournament, I stopped fighting for about six months because I was afraid of getting caught off guard again, even though that’s the nature of the sport. Karate has had a lasting effect on my mental state; I am hyper-vigilant of my surroundings — some could maybe say paranoid — and I still flinch when anyone comes close to my face. When I find myself in potentially dangerous situations I always try to strategize a way out.</p>\n<p>The most challenging aspect of being a woman in a male-centric sport was recognizing my limitations and differences from my opponents and trying to use that to my advantage. There were only three other girls in my age group during my 10 years of karate, all of whom quit before I earned my black belt. This gender disparity left the vast majority of my interactions, including sparring, with boys. Sparring is a form of fighting, often done with protective gear like helmets, gloves, shin guards and mouth guards. We would also practice open-hand fighting with no gear, called kumite.</p>\n<p>To say I got pummeled by men — both children and adults — would be an understatement. When I was 12, I was in the fifth hour of a seven-hour-long test and was paired up for a sparring match with a 20-something-year-old man who had an advantage of at least a full foot and 150 lbs. He did not take it easy on me, and the experience resulted in my first-ever panic attack. I will never forget how he yelled, “Hit me! Hit me harder!” as his fists beat me over the head and his kicks jabbed me in the solar plexus.</p>\n<p>That being said, some of the most vicious and brutal fighters I have ever engaged in combat with have been women. The first fist ever to punch me in the face belonged to a very large eight-year-old who absolutely annihilated me in a tournament matchup. Some of the worst pain I have ever experienced came from a mom in her 40s named Liz who bent my finger backward so hard I thought she broke it.</p>\n<p>In my experience, I have found that men are often hesitant to exert their full force on a very small pre-teen. Almost every woman I have ever fought has seemingly shared the subconscious consensus that while we don’t enjoy beating each other up, it is for our ultimate benefit and betterment as fighters.</p>\n<p>The necessity of taking self-defense classes became more glaringly obvious as I got older, and the emphasis on gender in the dojo became very apparent. The boys who did karate did it because they were hyperactive kids and they needed to learn discipline, or they wanted to learn to fight with swords and nunchucks. But for the very small female population — regardless of age — it was always about having the ability to defend ourselves should we ever be in a situation where it was necessary. From the age of 12 onwards, my sensei made a very big point of reminding me of all of the possibilities of violence against women that lurked beyond the walls of the dojo.</p>\n<p>The constant emphasis on violence against women, while it was important to recognize, became overkill in my mind. I was fed a narrative that made me believe that every stranger was out to cause me harm, and the message transitioned from one of caution to one of causation: “If you do x, y, z, all of these horrible things could happen to you!”</p>\n<p>Going to karate became a chore because if I didn’t learn to defend myself as adequately as I could, whatever could happen to me would feel like my fault, rather than the fault of someone potentially looking to cause me harm. While the environment of the dojo was conducive to physical strength and agility, it also conditioned a chronic pessimism and cynicism.</p>\n<p>When I earned my black belt at age 14, I became the first girl under 18 and the third woman in the history of my studio to achieve that feat. And while I may not be able to break a board with my bare hands or knock a man unconscious with a single punch, I put in just as much work, if not more, than any man.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that I stopped doing karate, it is an enormous part of my identity for better and for worse. Even though there are no female Grandmasters as of right now, they are coming. It may not be me, but the next generation of girls who infiltrated the boy’s club is growing up and they are kicking ass.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

I came from baseball, and I realized that ultimate frisbee gives you the opportunity to make big plays, like laying out or jumping over people (which we call skying).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I guess the sport has a big stigma when it comes to the word frisbee in general. You don’t really think of it as a serious sport, you think of it as being in the park or on the beach, but like Arthur said, when you get to college, you see all the intricacies that do come with it, like defenses, or zone or specific skill sets that each player has.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are some myths about ultimate that you guys would like to dispel? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I think most people find it super nerdy or hippie, or casual, but in the college level it’s pretty competitive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>When do most people tend to join the team?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I would say most people join it their freshman year, yeah.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I definitely agree with that, but we also get some later years. Whether people hear from their friends or they come in and transfer, we do get some kids who come in after their freshman year, but the majority are definitely freshmen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cool. So</strong><strong>, on more of a long term note, what do you think was your favorite part of Black Tide, or the thing you’ll look back on 10 years from now? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Ooh tough question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, going back to your last question, it’s really cool how you’re able to incorporate all these people from different sports, because very rarely are you able to get someone who played frisbee all through high school. For the most part, it’s a team with people who have played soccer, football, golf, baseball, volleyball, tennis, really just a huge variety of sports. You formulate the team and each player can incorporate their previous experience into a role on a team. I would say that’s one of my favorite parts of Ultimate Frisbee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I would say that for me, when I look back, I’m going to look back at all my teammates. Me and Bailey are both graduating this spring, and there’s been a lot of college defining moments with frisbee. I feel like I’ve really grown up with my class rookies, and I learned how to balance a workload with school and practice and hanging out with everybody. Just the whole experience of the team and even beyond the sport itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So how often does the team practice? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: We practice two days a week on the field and two days of lifting, and then during season, we’ll typically have a tournament on the weekends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So is there anything that you guys would like to say about Black Tide in general? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I don’t know if you know about the alumni network, but Black Tide was one of the earliest ultimate teams in the nation. We’re tied for the most national championships and as far as connections go you get to meet alumni dating back to 1984, and even in Regionals, we met Tom Kennedy, the founder of Black Tide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What sports tend to translate well into frisbee? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, I would say sports that test your agility, like football, soccer, so sports like that translate well into defense. Really, the biggest transition for freshmen is learning how to throw the frisbee and throw it with polish and precision. But then you also have guys like baseball players that have an advantage in terms of throwing, since their arms tend to start off a little bit better, so they might have an advantage to start. But sports like volleyball and basketball help too with verticality, and really a lot of different skill sets can work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What types of positions are there in ultimate? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: The most generic is the handler and the cutter, which if you break that down is similar to a quarterback and wide receiver, where the handler is touching the disc a lot. He has more polish with his throws, while a cutter, his main job is to catch the disc, whether that be with his verticality, something we call his radius of catchability, or just juking out the defender very often. So yeah, in very broad terms those two tend to be the general positions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What would you guys tell people who were thinking about trying out next year? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arthur:  Well, I would say if you’re unsure, just come out, because for most people, college ultimate is not what their image of it is like at first, whether they played in high school or not. Almost everyone I have talked to has said it’s more competitive than they thought.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bailey: Yeah, I would agree with that. College is all about finding your fit, your group of people. Our team is really diverse, and not just in the sense of diversity, ethnicity or culture, but in our majors, and it can just be more than frisbee. It’s honestly a family. People have gotten jobs through Black Tide, because you really do meet so many different people and you form such deep connections. It really is like a family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys think your best traditions are? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well I would say one of our best are Black Tide Pride, and honestly, I love our jerseys. I think they’re the best in regionals. We have really cool tie dye jerseys, and those date back to the very beginning of our program.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK:I would say one that’s been really important to me is BFTB, or “Black Tide for the Boys.” Another great one is “Black Tide Never Dies.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Oh, and a goofy one we sometimes say in games are “ooze, gush, stick, crush.” I still don’t know what that really means.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK: Well, our team name refers back to the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, so that’s what the ooze gush part is referring back to, and the stick crush part is about sticky defense, and we want to crush the other team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: So right before kickoff, one side will say “ooze, gush,” and the other will say “stick, crush,” just to give that sense of unity, and really showing the people on the field that they have 14 teammates who have their back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s been </strong><strong>the most memorable part of being on the team? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AW: Well, at the end of my freshman year, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a 19-centimeter tumor in my left hip, and I had to do 11 months of chemo. So I went back home, and I was inpatient, which meant I was in the hospital every week. So for me, this team is always for the boys, and that means something to me. In my year off, I still had people driving down to L.A., since I was at UCLA, every few months to check up on me and hang out with me. So for someone who had to leave school for a while, it’s really hard, because all of my friends from high school were at college, and all of my friends at college were obviously at college, so I was alone with my family, so it meant a lot to me to have people drive down. I was just a rookie at the time, and I still had seniors, I still had fifth-year seniors, sophomores, freshmen, just everyone wanted to check up on me. That was the reason [why] when I came back that it didn’t matter the rehab I had to do, it didn’t matter that I couldn’t run the full length of the field without throwing up, because I knew I had to come back to this team. I hadn’t met these people before, like Arthur and Bailey, but it didn’t matter, because I was Black Tide.

I love singing because it is a way to add positivity to my life.”</p>\n<p>Although it may seem that singing was always a positive experience for Snyder, this was not always the case. When she was seven years old, she was told to sing the national anthem at a local swim meet, but in the middle of the song, she forgot some of the words, which led to a very traumatic experience.</p>\n<p>“I was scarred,” she said. “I did not sing for two more years, but I finally had the courage to do it again two years later.”</p>\n<p>It would be reasonable to imagine that she would have had to sacrifice some of her time singing to primarily focus on her water polo career, but that could not be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>“Being a student athlete is definitely time consuming, so I don’t really have much time for other things, but I sing around the house and the pool a lot,” Snyder explained. “I don’t really sacrifice much.”</p>\n<p>The idea of Snyder singing the national anthem before games first came about when Head Coach Serela Kay asked her to sing the piece on Senior Day of the 2017 season.<br>\nWith the whole team on board with the decision, Snyder decided that she would give it a shot despite being extremely nervous that she would make a mistake.</p>\n<p>“My nerves are already up before games and my adrenaline is going,” Snyder explained. “My heart is racing and adding singing to that is very difficult. I was like, I got to do it for the seniors and then it just turned into something after that.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether she had to audition for Coach Kay, Snyder chuckled and explained how she was asked to perform. She would also go on to advocate for freshman Sami Stebbins joining her in the near future.</p>\n<p>“Sami Stebbins is pretty good,” she explained. “She is really good actually. When I leave, she will probably carry the torch.”</p>\n<p>For Snyder, there will never be any singing competitions between her and her teammates because they all have talented voices. Instead, her idea is that the best singers on the team should sing the national anthem together rather than one person having the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“No competitions,” Snyder explained. “I think Sami has a great voice. I would love for her to sing with me. Pip also has a great voice and can play the guitar. Emily can sing also. We should do it all together but definitely no competition.”</p>\n<p>Despite the stress that comes with singing before games, Snyder has been able to limit it through a mantra that she has recently started to follow profusely.</p>\n<p>“Singing probably makes me more tense before games, but a little mantra that I have been sticking with is that failure doesn’t exist and carries over into every aspect in my life,” Snyder said. “If you can’t fail, you can’t succeed, and the least I can do is try.”</p>\n<p>When performing in front of her teammates, Snyder has mixed emotions, especially since she is singing in front of the home crowd as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s nerve-wracking but comfortable, I’d say,” Snyder said. “I know they are all supportive even if I forget the words to the national anthem. Nobody will be upset or anything, so I feel very supported. It helps having a very close-knit team so everybody is always there for each other.”</p>\n<p>With the support of her teammates and the home crowd, it makes performing a lot easier as she explains that the applause quells her nerves and strengthens her bond with her teammates.</p>\n<p>She often finds herself listening to alternative rock in her free time, as it sets her into a positive mood as she goes through her hectic schedule.</p>\n<p>“I love so much music,” Snyder said. “I actually started with classic rock because my dad used to play it all the time. My favorite artists are probably bands nobody has ever heard of. I like Arctic Monkeys and Parachute in particular. When songs like “More Than A Feeling” by Boston come on, I am definitely blasting it in my car.”</p>\n<p>Despite being such a talented singer, her primary focus is on water polo and her education, as well as finding the perfect balance between the two.</p>\n<p>“As of right now, water polo and school is the most important thing right now,” Snyder said. “If I could become a pop star, that would be awesome, but it is not in the cards right now. Or probably ever. It will probably just be my hidden talent, just something fun to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Tournament coming up this weekend, Snyder will look to continue to bring this positive mindset that she has acquired through singing to the team as they look to make some noise in the tournament and win their second Big West Title in the last three years.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 26th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?ssl=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82729\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82729\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/","id":3399,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[3398,3397,3396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Unwavering Unity: A Look Inside The UCSB Women’s Rugby Team","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unnamed-e1525217406593.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unnamed-e1525217406593.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Although the UCSB Women's Rugby team might not get the attention that other sports do here on campus, their dedication and spirit are second to none.

While rugby is a sport that is widely popular, many don’t know that we have an incredible women’s team on campus.</p>\n<p>I got to sit down with a few of the ladies from the team as we discussed their motto of unity, how playing such an intense sport brings meaning to their lives, and how lacking sufficient school funding makes them rise above the rest.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Going just 2-4 in the regular season last year, the team found solace in their new head coach Zac Winter this season, who helped implement new practices and work hard to turn the team around.</p>\n<p>He certainly did his job well as the rugby team was nothing short of amazing this year, beating nearly every team in their way. Loaded with passion and exuding confidence, you’d be hard pressed to find another sport with athletes as driven as those on the UCSB women’s rugby team. With six seniors on the roster set to graduate, it was only appropriate that the team put on such a dominant performance in the regular season.</p>\n<p>Ending second in the league with an 8-3 record, the Gauchos were not able to carry that magic into the postseason as they lost to opponent Chico to end their journey to the championship. The team is not discouraged though, as they all mentioned that there is nowhere else for them to go but up.</p>\n<p>Rugby is a sport that requires precision, aggression, and players who aren’t afraid to get dirty or risk injury. “We do get crazy injuries, and if anything, we’re proud of them,” Sophomore treasurer Kayla Aurelio Hughes cleared up, “But there is so much more to our team and our story than just concussions and broken thumbs.”</p>\n<p>The team admitted that while the susceptibility to injuries is sometimes imminent, it makes the playing of the sport that much more enjoyable. No matter what happens to a teammate on the field, there is always another teammate right behind, ready to help with whatever the other needs – both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>Junior Jasmine Guevara pointed out that rugby has played a huge role in her life and her social circle: “When I first got to UCSB, knowing how shy I am, I honestly thought I wasn’t going to make many friends if not any. And here I am two and half years later, loving the sport and having more friends than I could have ever asked for, friends I know I can count on and off the field.”</p>\n<p>Unity is something the ladies make clear is the basis in all that they do, not leaving anyone behind. In a world full of inequality, the morale of the Gauchos women’s rugby team embeds the notion that their team is no place for any hate or opposition – unity and acceptance is all they know.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Maria Tejada gushed about the team’s motto of unity when asked about how it defines the team. She explained that “unity is the theme of our team for so many reasons. We win games because of unity, we work hard to come back from injuries because of unity, and we are extremely accepting because we have big hearts and because of unity.”</p>\n<p>While the team’s unity and standout aggressive play is not to be overlooked, often times they find themselves dedicating a lot of time to off-the-field activities as well. Funding is something UCSB women’s rugby works hard to keep steady, as they don’t receive as much school funding as several other teams on campus.</p>\n<p>“While we do get some funding from Rec Sports to help pay for coaching, we mainly rely on dues from players and fundraising,” senior Social Chair Haley Pedersen revealed, “It’s just an additional stress that gets in the way of our team growing. Fundraising can be hard because all clubs are trying to do the same fundraisers and when it comes to getting donations, there are a lot of people who do not support women playing rugby.”</p>\n<p>Despite the need to be assertive in their fundraising practices, the team makes sure not to let money concerns stop them from playing the sport they love. Senior Fundraising Chair Miranda Nillo optimistically noted that “since [The rugby team is] pretty much autonomous, it puts a lot of pressure on team leaders as far as what we decide to spend our money on. However, even though we’re not primarily school funded, we do know that the girls who do want to play rugby are willing to pay for it and are here for a reason! We’re all so passionate about rugby!”</p>\n<p>The heart of the Gauchos’ women’s rugby team is palpable, and their fortitude is unmatched. The cohesiveness of the group as a unit, translates through their superior play both on and off the field in all that they do. Women’s rugby not only participates in various fundraisers for their own team dealings, but they also consistently offer their time and effort to various charity events, giving back even whenever they can.</p>\n<p>The team is a well-oiled machine, with each member playing a pivotal part in keeping their success afloat. Hughes admired her team’s heart and ability to stay strong no matter what. She made sure to note that, “the girls keep the program running. I am so grateful to play with a group of driven, motivated women who don’t let anything get in their way.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho’s women’s rugby team proves that there is insurmountable strength in numbers, by displaying toughness through their unwavering team unity and proving that division is an unwelcome team weakness. Working together as a supportive unit, aids the team in accomplishing their goals together on the field and throughout their college career. Balancing school, sports, and jobs, these are some of the most talented women at Santa Barbara that you’ll ever meet.</p>\n<p>No team, funding issues, or opposition can stop the UCSB women’s rugby team – they are determined not to let anything get in their way.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/","id":3400,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[3399,3398,3397],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
