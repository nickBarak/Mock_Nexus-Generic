We all know it: That insufferable gambit of individuals, clubs and organizations who set up their tents and shove fliers in our face. Some of us have even been on the other side of the shoving — I know I have. But there is one thing that binds all of these groups together: they are all in the Arbor to promote their cause using the freedom of speech afforded to them by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, as well as the university policy which designates that zone as a 100 percent free-speech zone.</p>\n<p>Now, every so often, the groups that set up shop in the Arbor will be from camps that we as individuals disagree with. For example, recently the pro-life group “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust,” as well as a particular self-labeled preacher, have taken it upon themselves to share their messages and causes with the student body of our lovely campus. One group did so by showing graphic depictions of abortions, while the other by shouting words contrary to what this university as a whole generally believes to be empirically-supported fact.</p>\n<p>And how did our university’s community respond? Well, an assistant professor and at least two of hir (sex omitted for lack of relevance) students forcibly stole a pro-life sign which was later found in tattered ruins (there is currently no proof to link the professor to the destruction of the sign), and a large gathering of students surrounded this visiting preacher to listen to and hurl insults at him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you were to stop reading here, you might believe me to be an apologist for these two groups, but I promise you that is not my desire. I am writing this instead to raise the question of what is the appropriate response to an opposing opinion. Should we as a community encourage taking away an individual or organization’s ability to voice their perspective? Should we create an environment where it’s acceptable to antagonize someone who voices an opinion that, while unsubstantiated by any empirical evidence, is completely within their right as a citizen to hold? I am careful to say “antagonize” and not “debate,” because I believe that positive, respectful and productive debate can and should be held over these topics. However, this is not the response that I have personally witnessed.</p>\n<p>The reason I single out these two groups over the many others that have visited this campus in my time here as both a student and a staff member is because of their religious motivations. Religious extremists from any particular belief view personal attacks as a form of martyrdom. We fan the flame that motivates these extreme groups when we react at all, let alone when we react negatively. A crowd draws a crowd, and when you sit and poke fun at a group you disagree with, some of your friends might join in and soon enough you have amassed a large circle of people who are there to see what’s going on. At this point, the protester has won because they managed to amass a group of people to listen to their cause. Whether those people agree or not, they feel as though they have accomplished what they came to do.</p>\n<p>I have seen individuals like this traveling pastor and pro-life group visit this campus repeatedly for the past four years and they get a strong reaction from the community every time. To those who feel they are “fighting the good fight” by arguing visibly and loudly with these individuals, it doesn’t appear to be doing anything. You cannot reason with someone who refuses to (or is unable to) use valid reason.</p>\n<p>So next time you see someone with a book in hand, shouting things that any sane person would dismiss as nonsense, if you can’t approach them in an effort to create a healthy debate, maybe you should just keep on walking; let’s not help to build the pulpit this person is hoping to preach from.</p>\n<p><i>Alex Johnson graduated from UCSB in 2013 with a B.A. in sociology and currently works on campus.</i></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in print in the Monday, March 31, 2014 edition.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” sets a shining standard of mediocrity for action films and further serves as proof that live-action manga adaptations (well, more like anime adaptations, in this case) are generally not good ideas. Of course, giving writing duties to one of the minds behind “Transformers” hardly helps. The final product is a substandard action film that drowns the humanistic themes of its source material under a deluge of headache-inducing CGI cityscapes and a painfully bland corporate conspiracy story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, the first person to have their brain inserted into a purely cybernetic body. As a result, she can hack into the cyberbrains of other people and has superhuman abilities. Basically, she’s playing Black Widow again, but now her skin-tight bodysuit is flesh-toned. After her transformation, the corporate mind behind the Major’s creation, Cutter, comes up with the brilliant idea of taking this investment he holds so dear to his heart and putting her in a counter-terrorism unit. Smart business move there, bud. Put your experimental business asset in a profession in which getting a bullet in the ass is right in the job description. Then again, what can one expect when the film’s idea of a pre-asskicking one-liner is “The truth is … I wasn’t built to dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Major spends the first third of her own screen-time questioning her humanity, a theme central to the original manga source material that depicts a world in which cybernetic augmentation is as common as wearing a watch. The film makes this abundantly clear to us by showing a variety of humans who have undergone some sort of modification or other: chips in the brain to play music, cybernetic eyes, stuff like that. However, this deep thematic content goes down the toilet pretty fast in favor of “Matrix”-esque gunfights (in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow motion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and the tortuously cliché story of the super-agent searching for their forgotten past. Hey, DreamWorks. Jason Bourne called. He wants his plot back. Oh, and he’s also suing for defamation.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. Every 10 minutes or so, you’re treated to the sight of gigantic, colorful holographic advertisements pulled straight out of “Blade Runner” and waving at you. Once, it’s cool. Twice, it’s artistic. Eight times and the scenery is not only overpowering whatever character is in the shot, but the movie is also treating you like a complete moron. Yes, I know it’s a sci-fi movie, thank you very much. Now get to the next scene before I decide to go sneak in to see “Logan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps my analysis is a little too harsh. The film is at least visually inventive and arresting, that much can be said. Holograms aren’t used in any groundbreaking story manner, but in small touches, like having them disintegrate like sand upon the end of a conversation, which lends at least a little personality to their measly existence.  And the Major’s deep dive, her hacking into another cyber-brain, provides for a darkly hallucinatory experience (albeit one that is, weirdly enough, evocative of both “Code Lyoko” and Kingdom Hearts)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all its attempts to divert your attention that there is little under the surface of this shell, the third act kicks in hard. As the pieces fall into place, things actually start getting at least a little interesting when the questions about the Major’s identity are answered. The thing is, as someone who was at least a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">familiar with the source material, I was able to see the twist coming from a mile off.  Maybe others won’t and will be blown away by it. The interesting question though, without giving too much away, is can a movie be truly accused of whitewashing when the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">character </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herself has been literally whitewashed?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the film does not seem to care about the implications, nor does the protagonist dwell upon her revelation. “Ghost in the Shell” is still a dumb action movie, ground into a pulp by the Hollywood wringer. It may look somewhat the same as Masamune Shirow’s work, but its soul has been rent and mangled, rendered unrecognizable. The best I can say about the movie is that it takes the indecipherable technobabble of its source material and trades it in for a couple of entertaining and occasionally seizure-inducing combat scenes.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fellow Artsweek writer Ryan Hykes rates this movie an 8/10.  And that’s why he writes album reviews.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/","id":5833,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5832,5831,5830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Combatting Sexual Assualt: Taking the Next Step","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Second-year Emily Potter praises the campus organizations that are fighting for real change. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Scattered across the campus and Facebook are police sketches of the two men suspected of committing the past weekend’s act of sexual violence. It was not long before these two faces became familiar to Isla Vista and the campus community, but these two faces fail to represent the hundreds of other unreported perpetrators of sexual violence within our community.</p>\n<p>At the UCSB Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity department, the employees take turns watching over what they call “the survivor hotline,” a cell phone specifically for survivors that they can call to receive immediate assistance. Jill Dunlap, director of the C.A.R.E. program at WGSE informs us that for the past year they are averaging 40 new cases a quarter, all cases combined (sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking). Of those new cases, they average 21 new sexual assault cases reported to them each quarter. To put that into perspective, that is four new cases a week, two of which are sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Because of the underreporting of sexual violence and the social taboo surrounding the subject, many people remain unaware of just how frequently this crime occurs. The tragic events of the past weekend have somewhat shifted that awareness. The advocates at WGSE have been overwhelmed these past weeks with outreach from student and community organizations asking what they can do to help. They are grateful for the activism, but also want people to be aware of the unfortunate truth that these events are nothing new to them, and hope that the new energy behind the effort to make a difference does not dwindle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The last week of February, UCSB’s Take Back the Night held #TakeBackTheStreets week to “stand together against the racism, misogyny, homophobia, and general bigotry that we are expected to ‘take as a compliment,’” finishing with a rally on Friday that began at Pardall tunnel and ended on Del Playa. The co-ops have also shown interest in organizing a rally as well as St. Michael’s University Church and UCSB VOX Voices for Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>While rallies are important and effective at spreading awareness, it is crucial that we create long-term change by maintaining our activism beyond these final weeks of Winter Quarter. On March 8, the WGSE’s Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Program held its first Green Dot Bystander training, a one day hands-on training that provides participants with the skills to immediately prevent violence in their community. It empowers participants to intervene as a bystander and prevent sexual assault, dating violence and stalking in their communities. The free eight-hour workshop runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with lunch provided. For those unable to commit the time to attend the Green Dot training, C.A.R.E also offers a free one-time, two-hour training through which you can become C.A.R.E Connect certified. This training covers how to help if someone tells you they have been assaulted, how to recognize the signs of an abusive relationship, what resources are available on campus and in the community and what safe and effective actions you can take to make our campus a safer place.</p>\n<p>Having students attend either or both of these training sessions will not only raise awareness, but also educate community members on what they can do to help. The Green Dot and C.A.R.E trainings may be a bigger time commitment than attending a rally, but they offer sustainable and effective ways to reduce the occurrence of sexual assault in our community. Jill Dunlap assures that as long as students show interest in these programs and want to receive the training, they will continue to hold them. To sign up for either of these training programs, email care@sa.ucsb.edu and they will work with you to schedule a time for you to attend.</p>\n<p>For those looking for a more long-term involvement in sexual violence activism, C.A.R.E. also provides a Violence Intervention and Prevention Internship (VIP) program. With the VIP program, interns will work five to seven hours/week throughout the quarter. Their work will provide them with valuable knowledge about interpersonal violence and the skills to educate others and actively prevent violence in their communities. They will also receive a mini-grant to complete an education or prevention based program or campaign that will create change in their own community. To learn more about the VIP program and to apply, visit the VIP program GauchoLink description under the jobs, internships and on-campus interviews tab. All applications are due March 17.</p>\n<p>All of these rallies and intervention programs have one thing in common: A call for the formation of a stronger sense of community. The formation of this community is the only way we can hope to turn this trend around. The residents and business owners of Isla Vista, UCPD, students and campus faculty need to begin to work together to find a solution to this problem. We must not let the discussion die. The responsibility lies with us to prevent sexual violence. While ultimately education will prove to be the only way to truly end sexual violence, awareness and intervention are crucial steps that can be taken now. The UCSB Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity department has been working since 1975 to carry out their vision of a world free of oppression and violence. It is time we join them.</p>\n<p><em>Emily Potter is a second-year literature and sociology major.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, March 6, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I would like to comment on the responsible actions of a few students who helped law enforcement officers hold back the aggressive crowd as the situation escalated into a near riot.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate incident started with the near-fatal stabbing of a man on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. As the investigation of the assault continued, a large group of onlookers (many from outside of the I.V. area) gathered on DP. The crowd swelled to several hundred people; one person jumped onto cars and began dancing on them. When he was arrested, the crowd closed in around deputies, chanting and throwing bottles and beer cans at them. Fortunately, a few UCSB students attempted to intervene and stepped forward to assist the deputies in calming the unruly crowd.</p>\n<p>As we know, the dangerous and disrespectful actions of this crowd do not represent the attitudes of the UCSB student body. Instead, what stood out that night was the response of a few upstanding students who supported our deputies in this volatile situation.
