The office of EVPLA primarily concerns university and student relations with Isla Vista and the surrounding areas. The EVPLA office negotiates with campus administration regarding parking for Halloween and Deltopia, consults with local law enforcement agencies and distributes important information regarding I.V. and its surrounding areas to the campus community. In a 50-minute debate, the candidates for EVPLA were asked questions about what issues they would address and how they would address them if elected.</p>\n<p>One of the issues brought up during the EVPLA debate was student housing, particularly the high cost of living in I.V.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit.

This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community. – Paola Dela Cruz of the Open People’s Party (OPP)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Answering a question about Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill AB-3, Dela Cruz said she was a strong proponent of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“Since the very first day that Assembly Bill 3 was introduced, I have been part of the dialogues and meetings that have taken place in our local community,” Dela Cruz said. “I am in full support of this bill. I believe that our community needs self-governance in Isla Vista. This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, the structural changes outlined by AB-3 are not enough to incite change in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t do nearly enough,” Morse said. “I think that it’s a way to appease the students at this particular point in time. What we really need is representation, and the way that we get representation is through cityhood, not through the current structure.”</p>\n<p>In regard to addressing rape culture on campus, Dela Cruz said there have been a lack of programs to educate students about sexual violence at the university and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I will make sure that a yearlong sexual assault campaign is launched in Isla Vista because it is extremely disappointing that our university has never launched a sexual assault campaign,” Dela Cruz said. “I will make sure as the EVPLA I address this.”</p>\n<p>Morse said he wants to bring back the activism culture of I.V. in the ’60s and channel efforts toward anti-rape culture.</p>\n<p>“This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit,” Morse said. “I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62393\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877346452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62393\" data-attachment-id=\"62393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/charles-carlos-lopez-describes-how-ucs-are-unequally-financially-represented/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428970937\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"91\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62393\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt='EVPSA Candidate Charles \"Carlos\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented.

The candidates for EVPSA answered questions which focused on advocating for students’ interests on the state level, discussing funding issues within the UC and collaboration with the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting. – Independent Candidate Mohsin Mirza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mirza said he would work with existing lobby groups to pressure the state government to increase funding for the UC and push the UC system to slow growth spending.</p>\n<p>“I have been working within the association’s Lobby Corps and also in a number of clubs and OSL groups, and I feel like engaging with them will be one of the most important things I can do if elected,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said educating UC students and California residents is the best way to create change in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“I believe the most effective way we can fight back against cutbacks in our system and raises in tuition is to advocate for average students to know what’s going on, because when average students understand the systems that affect them and the ways that they affect them, their parents and friends will understand,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Referring to UCSA meetings, Mirza said A.S should be working with UCSA members throughout the year rather than once a month on issues facing higher education across the state.</p>\n<p>“If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he would make an effort to involve students in UC Regents meetings and student conferences if elected to office.</p>\n<p>“If I am elected as EVPSA, every time that we go to a conference I am going to put a priority on students that have never been to one,” Lopez said. “When we have a critical mass of students who understand the issues that face them, that’s when we can advocate for real systematic change.”</p>\n<p>Debates for other A.S. positions will continue on Wednesday and Thursday in the Hub. Elections will take place April 20-23 on GOLD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/","id":2828,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2827,2826,2825],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Candidates Engage Students in Q&A","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Candidates for the position of Associate Students (A.S.) off-campus senator answered questions from audience members in a series of two open forums Wednesday afternoon at the Hub.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62424\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62424\" data-attachment-id=\"62424\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/candidates-engage-students-in-qa/off-campus-sen-a-k-web_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429101503\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Off Campus Sen A-K Web_Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62424\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Candidates for the A.S. off-campus senator positions were split by last name into the A-K group (pictured above) and the L-Z group in the Hub to answer questions.

Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine and I.V. self-governance. Nine of the 13 candidates running attended the forums, all of which were associated with Open People’s Party (OPP). The 13 candidates are competing for 12 available seats, each of which represent roughly 1,000 undergraduates who reside off-campus. Each candidate had one minute to answer each question during the 50-minute forum.</p>\n<p>In regard to student fee allocations, first-year undeclared student Natalie Jordan said she would like to implement a quarterly review to help students understand how A.S. uses fee revenues.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been talking to students almost all week,” Jordan said. “Something a lot of you don’t know is that you pay almost $200 every quarter into student fees that go into Associated Students to pay for things like take-out at Ortega, the bike paths and things like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science and sociology double major Austin Hechler also said he would work to make sure fee allocations are more transparent.</p>\n<p>“I would like to work with the Student Fees Advisory Committee to make sure that our fees are a lot more transparent,” Hechler said. “About 34 percent of our student fees go to 400 NCAA athletes, and I feel like we can reallocate those fees to services that are more available to the general population.”</p>\n<p>First-year history major Sasha Bates said he is concerned students do not understand how their fees are allocated nor how A.S. functions.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to have more talks between the students and the government, so you actually know where you money is going,” Bates said. “When I’m walking around in Isla Vista and talking to people they don’t actually know what the Senate does.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan also said she wants students to better understand A.S.’s role on-campus and expressed her desire to lobby for better public higher education funding.</p>\n<p>“My goals for next year is to increase involvement and awareness on our campus so students like you and I can get involved in the fight against the defunding of our education on the state level and to fight against tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Regarding the A.S. Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine, Hechler said the movement is an issue “out of the students’ hands” and “on the global level.”</p>\n<p>“It really doesn’t bring our campus together,” Hechler said. “Although it is a large issue, it is important to realize that a lot of the consequences from divesting or investing are not things that the university cannot really take a stand against.”</p>\n<p>Bates said A.S. should not have to decide how the University of California invests its funds.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s the role of universities to take stances on geopolitical issues,” Bates said. “I don’t think it’s the role of A.S. to decide what other people should do with their money or what political beliefs their money should represent, so I don’t think the university should support divestment.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she would be willing to express a position on the matter after further understanding the divestment issue.</p>\n<p>“I would be happy to listen to both sides,” Jordan said. “With further knowledge, in the future I would be able to make an educated decision on what we should do if this were to come up again.”</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan however, she supports the campus movement for UC to divest from companies committing human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza region.</p>\n<p>“I support this resolution and I would hope to see that the divestment discussion on the UCSB campus be much more inclusive than divisive,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the issue of divestment is beyond A.S.’s agenda, because a previous bill calling for an end to human rights abuses has already addressed the issue at hand.</p>\n<p>“There is a dialogue that our population has to have, but I don’t think a bill for or against divestment is the way to make that dialogue,” Constantino said. “We’ve already had a bill to stop funding for human rights abuses, which answered the question, so I don’t know why it keeps on coming up.”</p>\n<p>In regard to sexual assault, Bates said A.S.’s first step should be to educate students about sexual violence on campus.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a huge deal, and our rates of sexual violence are a lot higher than a lot of other campuses across the nation,” Bates said. “The best way to stop all of our issues of sexual violence is through awareness.”</p>\n<p>Hechler, who sits on the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) as Vice President of Communications, said he would bring in IFC to assist in his efforts to prevent sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I believe the most important issue with sexual assault and sexual violence is that not a lot of people are aware of it,” Hechler said. “I would like to begin with the Greek community by really making sure that everyone in the Greek community is aware of this issue, because if I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything.”</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she is a survivor of a sexual assault and would work to create change in the university process for handling sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>“I am a survivor of sexual assault on this campus,” Melgoza said. “I have been working effortlessly to make changes and awareness over and over and over again not only with students, because I am a part of Take Back the Night, but also as well regarding my own case. It is not easy exposing myself to everyone, and I am making sure that policy changes are made.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she would support OPP External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidate Paola Dela Cruz’s idea of creating a “safe space” at the Pardall Center to improve the Community Service Officer (CSO) program on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Something I feel extremely passionate about is the Pardall Safe Space for women at night,” Jordan said. “Also, I’d really like to expand the CSO program.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Erin Barnett also said he was in support of Dela Cruz’ ideas for space spaces for students in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to work with her to make sure that, if you’re uncomfortable or if you’re drunk and you don’t have a place to go home at night, you can go there,” Barnett said.</p>\n<p>Bates said A.S. should also address sexual violence by taking into account students’ frustrations with local police.</p>\n<p>“One of the most important things we can do to stop sexual violence in Isla Vista is reach out to the police,” Bates said. “I’d like to improve police relations and continue the forums we’ve been having with the pizza with police officers, and maybe even improve it to something on campus with more people.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Isabelle Ninh also wants to work to improve relations with local police.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to continuing that and making sure that when the police are out there, we as students do not feel threatened and they understand that we as students have a right to defend ourselves and that if they are going to police us it is for a very legitimate reason,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>Regarding Greek life, Jordan said the university should continue to not tolerate any misconduct from affiliated chapters within Greek life.</p>\n<p>“I personally think that hazing and things like that shouldn’t be tolerated on this campus,” Jordan said. “I think that UCSB has already take a pretty large stance on that, and this tradition should be continued.”</p>\n<p>The candidates also discussed I.V. housing issues and whether or not A.S. should purchase property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. should not buy property in I.V., but rather support making I.V. a Community Service District (CSD) through State Assembly member Das Williams’ I.V.<br>\nself-governance bill AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Property in Isla Vista is very expensive — probably some of the most expensive you can find in California — and that would not be a good way to spend our money,” Hechler said. “I think the way to go about this issue is to support AB 3 all the way to the county legislature.”</p>\n<p>Bates also said the purchase of I.V. property would be an inefficient use of A.S. funds and also supported I.V. self-governance bill AB 3.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing for almost all of the issues with housing in Isla Vista is self-governance,” Bates said. “The best way to get a hold of Isla Vista and actually make meaningful change in Isla Vista is by making Isla Vista into something more than just unincorporated.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnet, A.S. should support efforts to establish I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely need to support the AB 3 bill,” Barnett said. “People in Isla Vista need to be in control of where they live.”</p>\n<p>However, Barnet also said he would also support A.S. buying property in I.V. in order to address current student housing issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done a lot with property in Isla Vista, and I think the Pardall Center is a good example of that,” Barnett said. “I think it would be a good idea to be able to house students.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she also fully supports A.S. buying property in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The acquisition of property in Isla Vista is actually extremely important for Associated Students,” Jordan said. “This would stop rent fluctuation by buying the property up, which would help low-income students.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said he supported A.S. buying property in I.V., as long as they consider how it might affect residents.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the university should take a bigger role in Isla Vista,” Constantino said. “My part as an off-campus senator will be to make sure to pressure the university in that the decisions they make and the property they buy or lease is made consciously.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she would address I.V. housing issues through informational workshops.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of housing issues, such as sometimes students don’t know how to sign a lease or are not informed,” Melgoza said. “I really want to make sure to set up workshops on that regarding housing.”</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 3 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The same rule applies in fantasy football. With the tail end of the season coming up, it’s time to think about bettering your team for the home stretch.</p>\n<p>A few things can define the player that you are looking for to improve your team. A buy-low candidate is a player who has either underachieved thus far or has struggled as of late, but has the potential to break out and finish off the season on a high note. And after all, fantasy seasons are won or lost in these coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Here are some potential buy-low candidates I think can finish out the season strong:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jahvid Best</p>\n<p>Best has been dealing with a turf toe injury and hasn’t recorded double-digit points or a touchdown since week two, when he had three.</p>\n<p>As we saw on Sunday, with Matthew Stafford back the Lions’ offense is about to become a whole lot better. Best will be a major beneficiary of Stafford’s play mainly because of his pass-catching ability. He is currently second behind Frank Gore in receiving yards by a running back this season. On Sunday, he had five receptions for 31 yards. His game-breaking speed makes him a candidate to take any run or pass to the house, and as the Lions’ offense improves and Best’s toe heals, expect great play from him.</p>\n<p>Ray Rice / Maurice Jones-Drew</p>\n<p>Lots of yards. Few touchdowns. It will certainly be difficult to get this owner to part with his first round pick, but if he is dumb enough to doubt that the scores will come, you should pounce on the opportunity to acquire either of these studs. Baltimore has relied too much on Joe Flacco and the passing offense, but will soon discover its identity as a run-first football team, with Rice being the main beneficiary.</p>\n<p>Jones-Drew may be harder to trade for, but his value will only go up from here on out. Just remember, down the stretch depth matters less and less. If you are looking to make a run for the playoffs, it’s all about your starting lineup, so even if you have to give up multiple players to acquire him, it will be worth it. The constant yardage guarantees steady production, and both Rice and Jones-Drew are guaranteed to touch the ball a certain number of times because they are vital to their teams’ offensive success.</p>\n<p>Knowshon Moreno</p>\n<p>Moreno’s value has been up and down all season, and he is just recently overcoming a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games earlier in the year. Moreno is by far the most talented player in a crowded Denver backfield and will show that in the coming weeks. Much like Best, his pass-catching ability makes him a great buy-low candidate, even if you don’t fully believe in his ability to run the football.</p>\n<p>The Broncos have a bye in week nine, so this may be the perfect time to target Moreno. Assuming Moreno will be healthy in week 10, Denver has a cupcake schedule heading down the stretch. They play St. Louis in week 12, before a fantasy-friendly playoff schedule of Arizona, Oakland and Houston in weeks 14-16.</p>\n<p>DeSean Jackson</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter who is playing quarterback for the Eagles — DeSean will get his. Jackson has actually put up better fantasy numbers with Vick at the helm, so this is good news with Vick set to start this week.</p>\n<p>The problem is Jackson’s health. He is still recovering from a brutal concussion and may not be ready to play this week. View this as a good thing. If you can convince his owner that he is not worth the trouble and trade for him on the discount, go for it. Once healthy, Jackson is a great #1 receiver with huge play potential, as he is another guy with game-breaking speed who can always take one to the house.</p>\n<p>Wes Welker</p>\n<p>He has 40 receptions through seven games this season — below his pace of over 110 receptions in each of his last three seasons (his first three with the Pats). He has 319 yards and three touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Brady has not needed to throw the ball lately for the Patriots to have success, but that will change. The Pats are a pass-first team and Welker will play well down the stretch. It is highly possible that he has been slowed down by his surgically repaired knee, but — barring any setbacks — shouldn’t that mean that he will only get better as the season progresses and his knee continues to heal?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush would like to invite anyone and everyone to come take a look at his crystal ball. It’s very, very shiny.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine by a tiebreaker secret ballot of 13-12-1 after a lengthy eight-hour meeting last night in the Old Little Theater and Givertz 1004.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.</p>\n<p>“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.</p>\n<p>“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.</p>\n<p>“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”</p>\n<p>According to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.</p>\n<p>“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.</p>\n<p>“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others. But this is happening because we have terrorist organizations that have left Israel with really no other way to keep its people safe. When terrorists put their weapons down and their hatred down, the wall comes down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major and engineering collegiate senator Jonathan Rothschild said he did not support the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I cannot applaud the decision for the resolution to not acknowledge a two-state solution,” Rothschild said. “What is so wrong with acknowledging Israel’s right to exist?”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Guy Singer said he was against the resolution because it did not reflect any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked for the past two years to build alternatives and to build roads of cooperation and making out investment system more socially, environmentally and governmentally more responsible, and these efforts have been met with nothing but disdain from the pro-BDS community,” Singer said. “Any divestment resolution in the future will have to incorporate the Jewish community in some way or another in order for it to work.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film and media studies and philosophy double major and Off-campus Senator Jenna Anderson said she supported the resolution, but wanted to see amendments made.</p>\n<p>“As you can see, most every senator has expressed concerns with the wording of this resolution,” Anderson said. “Maybe I’m an idealist, but I just don’t get why we can’t come together and fix certain parts of it just to make it a little bit more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said A.S. should look into changes such as including more numbers and looking into investments in other companies that might not be socially responsible.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we could include other countries as well,” Anderson said. “If we are focusing of Palestine then why can’t we add the other companies that we are invested in the other countries and not just focus on Israel?”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and history double major Proxy Senator Andrew Farkash said he supported the resolution as a way for the university to dissociate from a stance that favors one country over another.</p>\n<p>“Our investments as they are right now value Israeli lives over Palestinian lives,” Farkash said. “I think that taking our money out of this issue makes a statement that we don’t support human rights violations, but at some point it is just saying we don’t want our hands involved whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, it was hard for him to come out as a Jewish student in support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“It is difficult for me to sit here and say that I support this resolution, because I know and acknowledge and am so deeply connected to those histories,” Farkash said. “There are thousands of Jewish people like me who are coming out and saying we love our country, we love our ethnicity, we love our religion, but we don’t love the occupation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
