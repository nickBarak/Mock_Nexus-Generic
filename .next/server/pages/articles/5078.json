Irvine is currently tied for first after starting 2-0 in the Big West and owns the conference’s second best overall record at 18-7. Long Beach State is right behind Irvine with a 17-8 record on the year, but a double-overtime loss to Hawaii last month leaves the 49ers at 1-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB was disappointed to drop a game at home after winning its first conference game on the road against No. 16 UC Davis last month, but it will have an even tougher test at home this weekend when Irvine, the highest ranked team in the conference, comes to town.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If the Gauchos want to slow down the Anteaters, they will have to try and stop a powerful and balanced offense which has seen four players average well over one goal per game this season.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior utility Danielle Warde leads the way with 43 goals in 25 games while sophomore center McKenna Mitchell is right behind her with 41. Senior attackers Jessy Cardey and Hannah Croghan have contributed 39 and 34 goals, respectively, while no other player on the team has scored more than 17.</p>\n<p>Junior goalkeeper Jillian Yocum has been solid all year at the back against some of the nation’s best teams, averaging 6.6 saves per game and allowing the opposition to score double digits just four times in 22 starts.</p>\n<p>Against Long Beach, UCSB will face a similar offensive monster as the 49ers have averaged just over 10.04 goals per game, compared to 11.08 for Irvine and 10.27 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The 49ers are led by the duo of Chelsea Parks and Coriann Snyder, who have put away 42 and 40 goals this season, respectively. The two seniors have combined to score the second-most goals by any tandem in school history and are both in the Top 10 of individual scoring as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, worrying about Parks and Snyder on the defensive side isn’t the only problem. The 49ers strong defense has allowed just 5.9 goals per game to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>With only three games remaining in the regular season, the two games that UCSB plays this weekend are extremely important.</p>\n<p>While last weekend’s game resulted in a loss, an excellent second half is something that the Gauchos will look to carry with them into this weekend. After giving up seven goals to Hawaii in the first half, Santa Barbara conceded just one in the entire second half.</p>\n<p>Both Saturday’s match-up against Irvine and Sunday’s contest at Long Beach are set for noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 10, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54764\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54764\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/","id":5078,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5077,5076,5075],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Cal Poly Looking for Upset Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Cal Poly defeated UCSB 3-1 the last time these two teams faced each other earlier this month.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The historical background of the Blue-Green rivalry between UCSB and Cal Poly requires no explanation when analyzing the intense competition both of these teams present when facing each other. Thursday’s matchup will be the second meeting between the UCSB women’s volleyball team and the Mustangs this season. Cal Poly’s 3-1 victory over the Gauchos on Oct. 10 was its first win over UCSB in four years. Santa Barbara attempts to even the season series up, hosting the Mustangs in the Thunderdome. Cal Poly has not won a match in the Thunderdome since Nov. 6, 2010.</p>\n<p>Owning a 6-14 overall and 2-7 conference record, UCSB looks to upset a Cal Poly team that has won seven of its past eight matches. Prior to its five-set loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, the Mustangs had won seven straight. They currently hold a 15-5, 7-2 Big West record and are tied with LBSU for second place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-match losing streak after wins the week before, it seems like a possible change in the Gauchos’ starting lineup or rotation would be a possible solution to their setback. However, with just four seniors and a variety of players that have seen little to no time, the Gauchos do not have many alternatives to put on the court.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We don’t have a lot of options because we don’t have a lot of available people,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We have to get better at what we’re doing and we have to learn how to finish games and finish teams off.”</p>\n<p>Thursday being UCSB’s only match of the week, the Gauchos should be properly prepared for the Mustangs. They must find a way to prevent Cal Poly’s dominant duo of freshman Adlee Van Winden and Raeann Greisen. The two outside hitters have nicely complimented each other this season and are the team’s top two leaders in kills and kills per set average, owning a combined total of 249 kills and an 8.04 average. They shined in Cal Poly’s bout against UCSB earlier this year as Van Winden recorded 20 kills and Greisen added 17. Coming off her sixth Big West Freshman of the Week award after a weekend in which she recorded 38 kills and 21 digs, containing Van Winden along with Greisen will be a strenuous task.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] are going to set their outsides a bunch of times, they’re very good attackers from the pen,” Lantagne Welch said. “We actually did a pretty good job on Van Winden, even though she had a lot of kills. We feel like we didn’t give her a lot of ‘freebies,’ she had to really work for them. We have to be able to contain and score on our end.”</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to contain the Mustangs in their first bout. Santa Barbara outhit and outblocked Cal Poly, averaging a hitting clip of .239 and 18 blocks to the Mustangs’ .231 attacking average and 12 blocks.</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ inconsistencies to finish when playing in narrow sets has pestered the team for the majority of the season and was the deciding factor in Cal Poly winning the final two sets in their win over UCSB earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara played from behind in that matchup, causing a 1-1 tie in the second set of that match. But UCSB knows it must find a way to finish in hopes of avoiding another late-game letdown.</p>\n<p>“For us, it’s playing really good in the critical points,” Lantagne Welch said. “That was a determining factor in our match at Cal Poly and also affected us this past weekend. We need to get over that hump and have people that really want to be in a pressure moment come forward and play their best. We need more people to rise to that challenge and are excited about that challenge.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match between UCSB and Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/","id":5075,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5074,5073,5072],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Career Night From UCSB’s Joos, Ends in 3-1 Loss for Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVolleyball-CamerynBrock-19-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVolleyball-CamerynBrock-19-of-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Freshman outside hitter Devin Joos made the most of her opportunity in last night's match versus Cal Poly but the Mustangs were able to prevail for the 3-1 victory in the Blue-Green rivalry.

The defeat places Santa Barbara in eighth-place of the Big West standings, its lowest ranking since finishing in seventh in 2007.</p>\n<p>Winners in eight of its last nine matches, Cal Poly boast a 16-5, 8-2 conference record. Its 16-5 overall record is its best start through 21 matches since 2006. Moreover, the Mustangs’ current Big West record is their best since 2008 and ties them for second-place in the standings with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>For the second time this season, three different Gauchos amassed double digit kills. Despite outhitting Cal Poly in the match’s first two sets, UCSB found itself having to play from behind, losing the first set.</p>\n<p>It was an assertive start by UCSB in the match’s opening as its energetic play generated a 4-0 lead over the Mustangs. But the Gauchos could not maintain their momentum as the occurrence of 10 UCSB errors helped fuel Cal Poly’s comeback to tie the score at 15-15.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs were able to benefit from the Gauchos’ mistakes, going on a 6-2 scoring rally to 21-18 lead to force a UCSB timeout. In spite of pulling within two at 22-24 with a block by junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Joos, a kill by sophomore Savannah Niemen captured the 1-0, 25- Cal Poly lead.</p>\n<p>The following set would go on to unfold in the same manner of a close battle between the two teams. Santa Barbara achieved another strong start, opening the set with a 6-3 lead but allowed a 4-0 Cal Poly run that gave the Mustangs a 7-6 lead. As both teams traded point, UCSB eventually took a late 21-19 lead. Determining the result of the second set was a trade-off of scoring runs. A 3-0 run helped Cal Poly go up 23-22, but the Gauchos responded with a 3-0 scoring rally of their own. Back-to-back kills by senior opposite Britton Taylor capped UCSB’s 25-23 win and knotted the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Helping lead UCSB to its tying set victory were senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau and senior opposite Jaylen Vllanueva. Although she stuggled with a match-high eight errors and a .061 attacking percentage, Barbeau registered 10 kills while Villanueva notched her third double-double of the season with 12 kills and 11 digs. The Gauchos also tied their season-high of 81 digs, led by 21 scoops from freshman Emilia Petrachi. They even outblocked the Mustangs 21 to 13 but that was not enough to prevent Cal Poly from securing the victory in the last two sets.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s defense achieved its goal of restraining Cal Poly’s freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, holding her to just six kills on 51 attempts, it did not find a way to stop sophomore outside hitter Raeann Greisen.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] definitely played stronger towards the end of the match and that’s something that we need to fix, we were pretty flat in that last set,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch explained. “We gave up too many balls to Greisen in the seam. We needed to do a better job with our block on her.”</p>\n<p>Greisen continued her dominance against the Gauchos as she concluded Thursday with a match-high 14 kills. In addition to her performance, Niemen ended with 12 kills and a hitting clip of .450 while junior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald finished with 10 kills and a .348 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Offensively it was a tough night for both programs, but Cal Poly emerged with a match-high .294 attacking percentage in the third set. UCSB came within one, trailing 15-16 but could not maintain its hold on the Mustangs as they went on a 9-3 run to secure the set victory, extending their lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s momentum carried into the fourth set. It captured the lead and allowed just one early tie. The production of Greisen, Niemen, and Gruenewald happened to outperform the Gauchos’ play when it mattered most as they helped the Mustangs earn the 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB ended up with its fifteenth loss of the season, the Gauchos’ Joos felt indifferent about it being a negative for the team.</p>\n<p>“Mentally we won, even when we were down I felt like we were up. It’s just frustrating,” she said. “When I was out there, I could see that Cal Poly was scared. We just need to figure ourselves out and establish ourselves as a team better and have a little more pride.”</p>\n<p>UCSB gets a few days of rest without have any matches this weekend.

With just six matches left this season, it would take a miracle for the Gauchos to win out the remainder of their schedule to achieve a neutral finish.

UC Davis enters the Thunderdome with an overall record of 11-14 and 6-5 in conference matches. Saturday will be the first time UCSB and UC Irvine face each other this season. The two teams split last year’s season series with Irvine winning the first match 3-2 and UCSB redeeming itself with a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite limiting star senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in its first meeting against the Aggies, UCSB was unable to contain Davis’ offense, which hit over .300 in the match’s first two sets. Since the start of conference play, Davis ranks second in the Big West with 540 kills, 514 assists and 648 digs.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the absence of Squyres in that first meeting was junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht. She was the only player to achieve double digit kills with 17. Walbrecht ranks second on the team with a total of 234 kills and a 2.52 kills per set average.</p>\n<p>Still, as the conference leader with 406 kills and a kills per set average of 4.37, containing Squyres is not a guaranteed outcome. Prior to the Aggies’ recent loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, Squyres tied a 25-year-old school record with eight service aces in a five-set victory over Cal State Northridge on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We just need to know that a lot of balls are going to go to the outside,” Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve got to be really clean with our defense through six rotations, not just three. We have to do a better job consistently throughout a match of defending the left side.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may have found a hidden gem of its own at the outside hitter position in freshman Devin Joos. In spite of the loss to Cal Poly, Joos made the most of her opportunity in receiving more playing time in the front row. It is expected that after career-highs of 12 kills and a .258 hitting percentage that she will be a frequent asset in the Gauchos’ offensive attack.</p>\n<p>“She’s been a regular in our starting group for a little while now,” Lantagne Welch said. “She had an emerging game, and we just need her to keep being productive and keep contributing to the team.”</p>\n<p>Topping off the Gauchos‘ weekend is their match versus UC Irvine. It is not too common that a team faces a conference opponent for the first time this late in the season, but UCSB is optimistic about its chances.</p>\n<p>“We have tape on them as they [UC Irvine] do on us,” Lantagne Welch explained. “It’s kind of exciting to have that new, refreshing team to get to go after and see how you match up with. They have some dynamic players, and it’ll be a good battle. There’s some things that we’re working on to take to the Anteaters.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of what Santa Barbara’s strategy is heading into game day, certainly it will include a plan to try to prevent freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha from dominating. She leads the Anteaters with 283 kills, a 3.29 kills per set average, 28 service aces and 168 digs. Kekauoha has recorded an ace in the Anteaters’ last five matches.</p>\n<p>The versatile freshman recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award this past Monday. In the Anteaters’ last two contests, Kekauoha tallied a total of 35 kills and a .460 attacking percentage. Within this impressive feat was a career-high 20-kill performance in Irvine’s sweep of CSUN this past Saturday. In 17 of the team’s 23 matches, Kekauoha has registered double digit kills.</p>\n<p>Assisting the play of Kekauoha is redshirt junior Victoria Dennis, in her breakout year. Entering the 2015 season, Dennis had a career total of 133 kills, which includes redshirting her sophomore year. She has had no issue with embracing a bigger role, however, ranking second on the team in kills with 241 and kills per set at 3.01.</p>\n<p>The pattern of the breakout year continues with UCSB junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt. In four of the team’s last six matches she has earned double digit kills. Grunt ranks fourth overall in the Big West in hitting percentage with a .344 average and has made a significant improvement since the start of conference play with the second-best hitting clip at .402 percent. Grunt is currently third on the Gauchos’ roster in kills with 139 and second in total blocks with 74.</p>\n<p>“She’s putting up big numbers, so teams are putting more attention on her to slow her down,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need more balance on our team and other people to put the ball away. She’s been very consistent for us. We just need her to stay aggressive and stay after it.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s contests are two of UCSB’s last three home matches of the season. Santa Barbara’s rematch versus UC Davis on Friday, Nov. 6 will begin at 7:00 p.m. Its matchup versus UC Irvine follows on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 7:00 p.m. Both matches will take place in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/ucsb-not-willing-to-concede-as-season-winds-down/","id":5077,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5076,5075,5074],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
