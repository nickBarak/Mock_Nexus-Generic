Nick Song / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Greek life at UCSB over the past four years has been marked by the closing of several chapters of fraternities by their parent organizations, as well as a loss of standing among the campus community at UCSB.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>    Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity lost its standing with UCSB due to “risk management violations of the campus’s alcohol-free social event policy.” It still operates without the consent of the university.</li>\n<li>    The sorority Alpha Kappa Delta Phi was closed by its headquarters due to “risk management violations and hazing.”</li>\n<li>    Beta Theta Pi (Beta) was closed by its parent organization due to “risk management violations and hazing.”</li>\n<li>    Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity (NAK) closed after it was charged with “risk management violations in conjunction with sexual harassment/sexual assault.”</li>\n<li>    Phi Delta Theta Colony (Phi Delt) left campus due to “risk management violations,” which its parent organization felt were “incongruent with headquarter policies and values.”</li>\n<li>    Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity (Phi Sig) closed due to risk management violations, hazing and sexual harassment/sexual assault.</li>\n<li>    Delta Delta Delta Sorority (Tri Delta) will close in June 2019 due to decreased membership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to both students involved in Greek Life through the Interfraternity Council (IFC) as well as staff in the Office of Student Life (OSL), recent developments indicate improvement.</p>\n<p>Emma Parker, a scheduling systems manager representing the Office of the Dean of Students at UCSB, wrote that the Greek-lettered organizations at UCSB have “made great strides in the last few years toward building a safer, more responsible community through education, student-led initiatives, and programming.”</p>\n<p>OSL Director Miles Ashlock also noted different approaches from both the student and administrative sides.</p>\n<p>“We did have a rash of really serious, high-profile cases, which I think attracted a lot of attention,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>“Probably people realized that ‘hey, if the university is taking these steps then there must be something really concerning; we really need to look out for ourselves and each other, and take better care.’”</p>\n<p>Ashlock said student leaders within Greek organizations have taken more initiative in fostering relationships with administration.</p>\n<p>“I think we have seen some significant developments in terms of student leaders stepping up to create internal policies and procedures that contribute to the safety and better operation of their organizations. They have been a lot more open with us in terms of disclosing concerns, asking questions and proposing solutions,” he said.</p>\n<p>OSL has overhauled the way that staff members interact with those affiliated with Greek life, giving the Greek organizations more opportunities to interact with a wider variety of people in the office.</p>\n<p>“We started to cross-train, so rather than have a separate unit involving fraternities and sororities, work is divided among multiple people, so fraternities and sororities get to know pretty much everyone,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Having closer relationships with a broader scope of staff has given Greek life “a lot more opportunities to interact and a lot of opportunity for [OSL] to connect with them across our program areas with other campus organizations and leadership development,” he added.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said there are broader shifts in the demographics of the university which reflect in the conduct of fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>“I’m heartened to see the demographics of our campus more closely reflect the demographics of the state,” he said.</p>\n<p>“What I see is an ever-increasing emphasis on school and studies and people seeing the value of education over maybe what was the in the ‘80s or ‘90s the perceived ‘coming-of-age experience in college.’”</p>\n<p>UCSB IFC President Zachary Hedges noted that the IFC, in cooperation with other Greek councils, has worked to develop an accreditation program.</p>\n<p>The program includes workshops that aim to “help students improve their well-being and learn to recognize and prevent the potentially dangerous situations that are most common.”</p>\n<p>Ongoing collaboration with campus organizations such as Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), Alcohol and Drug Program (ADP) and Campus Advocacy, Resources, &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), have helped ensure that these workshops remain “relevant and engaging,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“The IFC is also a strong advocate of making sure that all of our members are encouraged to report sexual assault and understand the options available to them in order to do so.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appear on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Public Safety Commission held a public safety meeting in Isla Vista Theater yesterday where attendees discussed ways to improve safety and quality of life in Isla Vista.<br>\nA.S. Public Safety Commission Chairperson and third-year biology major Molly Morrison organized the event in hopes of bringing Isla Vista residents together to brainstorm ideas to enact safety reform in I.V. The students who spoke at yesterday’s meeting, all of whom expressed that they were impacted by Friday evening’s tragedy, voiced that I.V. culture needed to be directed in a positive direction in light of recent events.<br>\nMorrison opened the meeting by describing A.S. Public Safety Commission’s involvement within the I.V. community. Following Morrison’s brief introduction, audience members were given the opportunity to address others in the audience.  According to Morrison, the event was primarily aimed to educate students about what public safety resources were available to them and what avenues were available for getting involved with public safety in I.V.<br>\n“I think a lot of students came to the meeting tonight not knowing what Public Commission was or did at all or what resources they had in the community and in A.S.,” Morrison said. “I think our community came together tonight with a bunch of great ideas and I hope we can move forward as group dedicated to improving Isla Vista.”<br>\nFirst-year computer engineering major Robert Stosick presented three ideas at the meeting to prospectively improve safety in I.V. such as the installation of a siren system, a gunfire locating system such as ShotSpotter — a program that installs dozens of sensors in an area in order to immediately relay gunshot locations — and emergency phone stations throughout I.V. However, Stosick was uncertain the ideas introduced by him and others would reach fruition.<br>\n“I would like to think the ideas brought up by all of us tonight will be taken into consideration, but I do not know if these ideas can be carried out because Isla Vista does not have its own form of government and is entirely dependent on outside entities,” Stosick said.<br>\nMorrison also said all audience suggestions would be taken into consideration, including better fencing along the bluffs of I.V. and a possible I.V. community center.<br>\n“It is hard to say what is practical right now as Isla Vista is not a self-governing body, but I think we can take it upon ourselves to improve fencing conditions,” Morrison said. “I also think it is possible for us to take an existing building and create a community center building.”<br>\nAccording to Morrison, another public safety meeting is in the works and any students interested in I.V. public safety can check out the “UCSB AS Public Safety Commission” Facebook page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/","id":3014,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3013,3012,3011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Creates Anti-Sexual Assault Measures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/napolitano122way-c48e8812a811823643248af8099e08df8e5f6a5e-s6-c30-e1379334859917.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/napolitano122way-c48e8812a811823643248af8099e08df8e5f6a5e-s6-c30-e1379334859917.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"University of California President Janet Napolitano announced the formation of a system-wide task force to address sexual assault and sexual violence on campus this past Friday in an effort to make th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>University of California President Janet Napolitano announced the formation of a system-wide task force to address sexual assault and sexual violence on campus this past Friday in an effort to make the UC a national leader in combating sexual assault on university campuses.</p>\n<p>The announcement comes several months after the UC Office of the President issued an update in March to the university’s sexual assault and sexual harassment policy, made in compliance with the 2013 federal reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The task force will oversee efforts made system-wide to prevent sexual violence and will allow various UC campuses to share effective practices in regard to sexual assault prevention, response and education.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokesperson Dianne Klein, the formation of the task force was not mandated by the policy update, but came directly from Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a serious crime that we will never tolerate,” Napolitano said in a statement. “The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.”</p>\n<p>The task force is comprised of 23 individuals from nine undergraduate campuses and UCOP, — including three UC Regents — and will meet via teleconference every two to three weeks and twice a month in person in July and September. A report regarding the task force will be presented to the Regents during the upcoming July 16-17 meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Ricardo Alcaino, Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, while each UC campus is unique and has different needs to consider when responding to sexual assault, some standardization throughout the UC system is “still feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Having some minimum requirements around education for incoming students, ongoing education throughout a student’s time on any campus, and on-campus advocates for survivors could be some areas where campuses could be held to the same standards,” Alcaino said in an email.</p>\n<p>The task force could also create “meaningful change” if it lead to the establishment of some standardization of guidelines for sexual assault response for students, staff and faculty, according to Alcaino.</p>\n<p>“There simply cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this work,” Alcaino said in an email, “but having resources that campuses can share and use is a reasonable goal for the Task Force.”</p>\n<p>According to Jill Dunlap, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education and Women’s Center programs, UCSB’s GauchoFYI program is a good example of a practice that could be shared with other campuses via the task force.</p>\n<p>“[It] is a stellar example of collaboration among different departments, including the CARE program,” Dunlap said in an email. “We think requiring first-year and transfer students to go through comprehensive, in-person alcohol and sexual violence prevention programming within their first six weeks of school is important.”</p>\n<p>Alcaino also said the collaboration between CARE and the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment has “proven to be an effective model for the [UC] system to emulate.”</p>\n<p>Savannah Badalich, a fourth-year international development studies major at UCLA and one of two undergraduate students on the task force, said despite her excitement over the “freaking amazing” formation of the task force, more student representation is needed.</p>\n<p>“There should be more students,” Badalich said. “I was kind of hoping that there would be one [student representative] from each school … this is a student issue, there should be a student majority on that task force.”</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, third-year literature major and Associated Students Student Advocate General, also said there should be more student involvement with the task force.</p>\n<p>“I’m also concerned about the apparent lack of student feedback on this task force … [four] student voices is not enough here. The UC system has over 200,000 students. You can’t simplify that to [four] representatives,” Loverin said in an email. “I’d like to see at least two reps from each school, preferably representatives nominated by their student body.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the number of student voices on the task force, Klein affirmed that students are represented and said for any task force to be effective it “can’t be too large,” although she could not comment on the how the members of the task force were selected.</p>\n<p>Badalich also said she hopes the task force will recommend additional funding, particularly for mental health resources for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>“What students need are resources, especially mental health resources … that is stuff that requires money,” Badalich said. “That’s sort of the factor. You can say all you want in support of a cause, but if you don’t give money towards it, it doesn’t mean crap.

The meeting began with a seven-minute moment of silence held in honor of the shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones reported on the successful efforts coordinated by A.S. executive officers to construct a board for students and community members to share thoughts and feelings in light of recent events. Jones said the board has received non-stop participation, particularly after media coverage in Isla Vista has subsided.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really, really beautiful thing,” Jones said. “We spent all day yesterday and today out there. It’s been a constant flow of students [and] community leaders … who are just coming forth, looking at it, participating, adding thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics and accounting major and Internal Vice President Angela Lau said she has been working on several events to help students heal from the recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working nonstop from Saturday on the candlelight vigil, the memorial and other projects of healing on our campus,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh discussed some of the problems that occurred with the UCSB emergency email message system on the Friday night of the shootings. Singh said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown justified the delayed warnings students received that evening as an attempt to maintain peace.</p>\n<p>“He tried to make an excuse, and said something along the lines of ‘There was a safety concern, we didn’t want people to panic,’” Singh said. “To me, speaking personally, this kind of concerns me because this alert system is made for us to be notified for something like this going on.”</p>\n<p>Singh, a third-year political science and film and media double major, said students frequently receive alerts and warnings about relatively unimportant happenings.</p>\n<p>“We get police alerts all the time for smaller stuff, but we don’t get it when something like this happens,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh also said students should make a concerted effort to be aware of issues related to gun legislation.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been happening, just keep an eye on what’s going on with gun law legislations,” Singh said. “I know that’s been really big, especially [Tuesday] with the memorial. Today, Das Williams proposed his legislation and it was on CNN, so keep an eye on it. It’s something that’s relevant to our community.”</p>\n<p>Several different A.S. executive officers made efforts to reach out to senators to provide emotional support. A.S. President Ali Guthy, a third-year sociology and psychology double major, said she appreciated community efforts over the last week and would be available as a resource to senators and students.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s been a really rough week, and the amount of support we’ve been giving each other as a community has really been inspiring,” Guthy said. “I love you all. If you need anything I’m here as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Senators then passed a resolution to formally request that Chancellor Henry T. Yang ask First Lady Michelle Obama to appear at UCSB and speak on the recent tragedy. Senator Jimmy Villarreal, fourth-year communication major, said the first lady could provide support to the Isla Vista community during a difficult time.</p>\n<p>“In light of the most recent events, we need an inspirational speaker,” Villarreal said. “She will not be coming as a political figure, but as first lady of the United States. I like to think that’s like the mom of America. That’s what we need.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, fifth-year biological anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at public forum to condemn newly appointed External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras for lying to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>, citing documented contradictory statements. He said Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies double major, made incorrect statements regarding the legality of a sales tax and subsequently lied about making those statements.</p>\n<p>“Not only is it as bad as they said, not only did they quote her correctly, but it’s worse than they actually quoted her,” Plotke said. “I want you guys to just think before you take what she says as the truth. Just remember that she lied to the <em>Nexus</em>, she lied to me.”</p>\n<p>On former Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s request, Lau asked Plotke to leave for the remaining duration of the meeting, to which Plotke obliged.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed included debate over Senate approval of staff positions for A.S. executives, planned study jams this evening at the A.S. Annex that will provide free food for students, a bill to create a commemorative memorial plaque for the victims of the shooting and the unanimous passage of a resolution to encourage more socially responsible investments by the UC, which had previously been passed unanimously by the outgoing Senate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/","id":3016,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3015,3014,3013],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
