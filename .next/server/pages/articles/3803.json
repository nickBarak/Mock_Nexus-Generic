The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby said a new smartphone app will launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route. This service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lines 24x, which runs from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, and 12x, which runs from Hollister to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. Some routes or bus times will be removed entirely, although MTD has yet to determine which ones.</span></p>\n<p>Stops along Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x 23, and 25 will also be adjusted in their times, but frequency of stops will remain the same. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said transit planner Mark Clyde. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10 minute to 15 minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a potential new route will run two trips during the morning and evening commute hours between Goleta and Carpinteria, which will be funded by Caltrans.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although ridership has decreased and one grant was lost for Lines 1 and 2, MTD officials said the bus schedule changes are only due to traffic congestion and not in response to decreasing ridership and funding loss, as the </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first reported.</span></em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that stops along Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x 23 and 25 will also be reduced in frequency.

Eliason</em></p></div>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is now the largest recorded wildfire in California history after burning through 281,620 acres of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 20 days.</p>\n<p>A total of 1,586 fire personnel continue to fight the fire, with 116 fire engines, 61 fire crews, 26 helicopters, 19 bulldozers and 31 water tenders on the job, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The fire is currently 86 percent contained.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire that burned in San Diego County in October 2003. The Cedar Fire burned 273,246 acres, caused 15 deaths and destroyed 2,820 structures.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is approximately 16 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The fire line from Ventura to Santa Barbara is “contained and secure” and fire officials do not expect the fire to progress further since wind speeds have slowed, according to a Cal Fire press release on Sunday.</p>\n<p>All mandatory and voluntary evacuations have been lifted in Santa Barbara County, with the exception of a voluntary evacuation warning on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280.</p>\n<p>The blaze began on Dec. 4 and its cause is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire’s incident tracker.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents experienced <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/i-v-residents-out-of-power-for-three-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blackouts</a> the night the fire began and responded by flooding the streets of I.V., <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/watch-fireworks-and-couch-burnings-from-the-i-v-power-outage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting off fireworks and burning couches</a>.</p>\n<p>Air quality in Santa Barbara and Goleta improved to “good” after weeks of the “unhealthy” air quality that prompted Chancellor Henry T. Yang to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/petition-to-cancel-classes-due-to-thomas-fire-gains-3000-signatures-in-one-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cancel classes</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postpone finals.</a></p>\n<p>As many Santa Barbara evacuees begin to return home, county officials are encouraging residents to be aware of hazards caused by the fire, such as downed power lines.</p>\n<p>Residents may also see an increase in displaced wildlife and Cal Fire is urging residents to maintain a safe distance and avoid feeding animals.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has remained far from Isla Vista and the UCSB’s campus, but students felt its effects as they concluded Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuation center</a> at its Multi-Activity Center on Dec. 5, which held up to 200 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/thomas-fire-evacuees-hope-to-return-home-soon-ucsb-evacuation-center-remains-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuees affected</a> by the Thomas Fire. The university closed the shelter on Friday, Dec. 22.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans also stepped up during this tumultuous time. The I.V. Food Cooperative provided a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-20/isla-vista-food-co-op-aids-victims-of-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food donation bin</a> for those affected, raising over $1,000 in donations and offering a 15 percent discount for evacuees.</p>\n<p>Firefighters will continue to patrol the fire’s perimeter and use aircraft to drop water on steep areas with limited access. According to Cal Fire, firefighters intend to remain on standby in case new fires erupt as they work to suppress the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Dec. 25 at 10:34 p.m. </em></p><div

As the names and ages of those who died in the mudslides were read aloud, community members quietly shed tears with the pain of losing a friend, neighbor or family member.</p>\n<p>At least 20 people lost their life in the mudslides that occurred early Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Benitez: 10 years old<br>\nKailly Benitez: 3 years old<br>\nJoseph Francis Bleckel: 87 years old<br>\nMartin Cabrera-Munoz: 48 years old<br>\nDavid Cantin: 49 years old<br>\nMorgan Corey: 25 years old<br>\nSawyer Corey: 12 years old<br>\nPeter Fleurat: 73 years old<br>\nJosephine Gower: 69 years old<br>\nJohn McManigal: 61 years old<br>\nAlice Mitchell: 78 years old<br>\nJames Mitchell: 89 years old<br>\nCaroline Montgomery: 22 years old<br>\nMark Montgomery: 54 years old<br>\nMarilyn Ramos: 27 years old<br>\nRebecca Riskin: 61 years old<br>\nRoy Rohter: 84 years old<br>\nPinit Sutthithepa: 30 years old<br>\nPeerawat Sutthithepa: 6 years old<br>\nRichard Loring Taylor: 79 years old</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80384\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80384\" data-attachment-id=\"80384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1251\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil at Sunken Gardens-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=888%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80384\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=888%2C542\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local elected and community leaders organized the event and offered words of hope to attendees, many of whom knew people who were lost in the mudslides. <em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Local elected and community leaders organized the vigil, including First District Supervisor Das Williams, County Board of Supervisors Chair Joan Hartmann, State Senator Hannah Beth Jackson and Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>Members of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist faiths also came to support the community in its grief.
