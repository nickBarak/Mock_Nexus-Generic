And in the indie rock luminaries’ first full-length album in seven years, vocalists Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner are belting their hearts out onto the table in true Wolf Parade fashion. <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> has all the energy of a sugar-filled toddler tucked into bed with a blanket of dejection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In “Valley Boy,” the album’s first single, the band provides a valley filled to the brim with sonic sweets. It deepens and spills over, the drums, guitars and vocals trading center stage and playing off of each other like actors in a meticulous drama. The subject of the drama appears to be a David Bowie-esque figure, a beloved singer lost to the realm of the dead whose last phase in life holds some mystery. (And who’s to say it’s not Bowie himself? The icon is a noted influence of the band, after all.) The lyrics are accusatory; they sound as if they are spoken by a distraught fan or old friend of the famous songster. Krug asks the deceased singer questions he can’t answer: “Are you still a lover boy? / Are you still on the cover or / Did you become a valley boy out there?” He obsesses over how this singer could have possibly lost his lovely and sincere disposition, and he dreads this betrayal. This hostility is a thin veil for grief. Emotions contend and pull Krug in every direction, but his confusion sounds so good.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRslooNX4Js?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Similarly equivocal is <em>Cry Cry Cry</em>’s second single, “You’re Dreaming.” Boeckner grabs the mic to bemoan the daydream of the information age in a blissfully sardonic number. Although the dream is a bad one taking place in a fantasy world inseparable from violence and destruction, there’s so much excitement in its sound. The song introduces itself with the cheeky staccato of a keyboard. Guitars electrically weave in and out of the melody, helping to drive the beat forward in the verses and constructing flaring bridges between them. Lyrics and sonics ascend into the deceptively jubilant howl of an individual trapped in a bad dream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wolf Parade isn’t afraid to take risks on their comeback album. The linear “Incantation” is them at their most assertive and unafraid. The band unleashes a horn section after the song’s first dive into cacophony, a tornado of twinkling keys and buzzing guitars. The guitars win out with bursting notes but quickly pull back to let the piano begin a forceful trot that just as quickly reconvenes with its instrumental co-conspirators, who by the end of it are wailing and stomping their feet. Where “Incantation” is a deliberate march into chaos, “Flies on the Sun” is a woozy march through the oppressive sands of time. By its fourth and final minute, you’re teetering on the brink of collapse. By the end, you’re one of many “flies on the sun, lying there.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All of these songs, however, are bite-sized treats compared to the king-sized “Baby Blue” and “Weaponized.” These six-minute tracks make up the core of the album, and they are a one-two that reckons with the best of them. The great control and eccentricity Wolf Parade displays in these power ballads is the band at its most impressive. “Baby Blue” is an epic display of the band’s capability. It sounds like a battle royale taking place in a locomotive that’s careening around corners and through mountains. “Weaponized” is a bit more measured. A skillful combination of anxious energy and bleeding soul backs Boeckner’s singing about a battle with yourself that feels like a battle against the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Modern-day isolation is certainly a recurring theme, but Wolf Parade is not saying they have any solutions for it. While Krug tangles himself in the pain of isolation on “Am I an Alien Here,” Boeckner begs for it on “Artificial Life.” He pleads for some peace and quiet in a soundscape like the world of a broken arcade game that he’s been sucked into. What the band finally arrives at, though, is a question. The closing track, “King of Piss and Paper,” is a meditation on the political and social state of the world. Wolf Parade asks if it’s okay to sing about love and ourselves at this time in a geopolitical environment led by a fear and hate-mongering papier-mâché man. This “king” threatens people’s ways of life and, in a way, love itself. So is it wrong to ignore him to attend to ourselves and each other, even if for a second? Isn’t it wrong that it feels that way?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This fear, this hatred, these illusions and their concomitant feelings of overstimulation and alienation stand front and center in the album. What Wolf Parade did with <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> was give voice to those emotions of the modern age that swirl in the chaos. They gave us a thoughtfully grand exhibition of the sickness of the times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79199\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79199\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/","id":6676,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6675,6674,6673],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt","biography":"Not available","articles":[5610,6582,6615,6657,6676,6679,6868],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"5 Acts Who Could Have Delivered More Than JT on Super Bowl Sunday","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The choice of Timberlake as singular ringleader of the biggest entertainment event of the year has left many baffled, as his only memorable track in recent years, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” is fr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, Feb. 4, Justin Timberlake  took the stage at the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show and proceeded to underwhelm 106.6 million viewers. Clad in a camo suit and a shirt emblazoned with a mountain scene, JT touted his new hipster-meets-mountaineer persona, which has accompanied his recently released (and not very good) album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man of the Woods</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The choice of Timberlake as singular ringleader of the biggest entertainment event of the year has left many baffled, as his only memorable track in recent years, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” is from the soundtrack to “The Trolls” — an animated children’s film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timberlake is an undeniable entertainer, but has more recently shined greater on stages like “Saturday Night Live” than in concert venues. While relevance is not a prerequisite for halftime supremacy, usually only artists with legendary status can pull off a show without it (see Madonna’s 2012 show). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make matters worse, Timberlake’s history with the Super Bowl, 2004’s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nipplegate,” set the stakes for the show very high. A Prince hologram, which went against the music legend’s wishes, was also rumored to make an appearance. Timberlake needed an extraordinary spectacle that could take his audience out of this world, but he only delivered a low-energy performance which lacked the transformative powers the Super Bowl halftime show is known for. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of five artists who could have delivered that energy and put on a more relevant and compelling show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rihanna </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Rihanna has not performed at the Super Bowl seems almost sacrilegious at this point. Rihanna has continually proven to be one of this generation’s most compelling performers, and with 14 No. 1 singles, she has an endless catalog of songs to perform. Despite not releasing an album since 2016’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rihanna was still 2017’s most-streamed female artist on Spotify.

His headlining performance at last year’s Coachella and performances at this year’s Grammys, College Football Championship and VMAs all prove his ability to deliver a high-profile, awe-inspiring show. In 2018, Kendrick has already dropped three massive singles from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, which he is producing, giving him more than enough new exciting material to perform, not to mention the potential for guest appearances from The Weeknd and SZA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick, the complete opposite from apolitical and stagnant Timberlake, could deliver a performance which would not only recognize the recent shift towards rap in pop music but also deliver a relevant statement on the state of America, one the NFL would be wise to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cziv-WGRLcE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk, who performed Sunday’s national anthem (under the duress of the flu no less), is a pop star who has stood the test of time. Her music catalog has spanned almost two decades, and she continually cranks out hits, including this year’s “What About Us.” While a figure from Timberlake’s time at the charts, P!nk has continued to stay relevant and has managed to keep churning out a fresh sound. Plus, her passion for high-flying acrobatic performances would no doubt excel in a giant stadium venue.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2woDr_ozkU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn’t love Drake?

While not always the most innovative artist, there’s a reason Drake can release near identical songs year after year and still make it into our playlists. He’s got a formula and it works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recent surprise release EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Hours,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has already produced the No. 1 single, “God’s Plan,” which has already situated itself as the anthem of 2018. Drake’s voice is enough to unite America, and a Super Bowl performance that coincided with his newly released tracks would generate unfathomable hype that would energize any crowd — something JT just could not do.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0uiw4xE7Cs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet Jackson </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as Timberlake was announced as the halftime headliner, an uproar was sent throughout the musical universe. At the 2004 halftime show, as JT and Jackson finished the show to Timberlake’s recent hit “Rock Your Body,” Timberlake tore off a segment of Jackson’s costume, which led to the infamous wardrobe malfunction, Nipplegate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the aftermath of the incident, Jackson’s career suffered as the media allocated her with almost all blame, while Timberlake’s career escaped unscathed. Fans on Twitter acknowledged the incident and supported the music legend by tweeting #janetjacksonappreciationday on Sunday. In the context of the recent #metoo and #timesup movements, an appearance by Jackson would be a timely statement on the systematic biases which women are subjected to, and a moment of redemption for a music legend. Both would offer more excitement and spectacle than Justin Timberlake’s tepid voyage through his musical catalog.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzC78pNk0MM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/","id":6673,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6672,6671,6670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Andrew Bird Soars with Melodic Sounds at Campbell","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Behind his aslant silhouette on stage, the visual recording of Echolocations: River played on a backdrop. Bird plays the violin in sequence with the video projection.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a strike of his versatile bow, Andrew Bird transformed a standard lecture hall into a fine-tuned orchestral venue. His sheer musical talent gives way to an unequivocally enticing and nimble sound. Bird is well-known for his virtuosic violin technique along with expert whistling, vocals and intermittent additional instruments. This previous Saturday, Oct. 14, his cult following did not disappoint, completely filling Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The minute I took my seat, I tuned into anticipation-filled murmurs from the crowd; audience members remarked on Bird’s extensive set-up compared to previous performances. Bird silently arrived onstage as the lights shut off to accommodate his hushed entrance; the soothing sound of his electric violin immediately followed. Bird began with notable pieces from his newest album, <em>Echolocations: River</em>, an eight-track album recorded while he was standing in the Los Angeles River.</p>\n<p>Behind his aslant silhouette on stage, the visual recording of <em>Echolocations: River</em> played on a backdrop. Bird plays the violin in sequence with the video projection. The violin’s ring bounced around the auditorium, a soft bowing along with poignant staccato. I wondered why Bird did not play the entirety of the melodies live until I grasped that he was acting as his own “echo” for the astonishing live experience of<em> Echolocations</em>. He focuses on reverberating to his own tracks, allowing for a sweet-sounding resonance. After playing roughly three tracks of his newest album, Bird reverted to performing <em>Echolocations: Canyon,</em> part one of his newest album. At this point, the backdrop began to project bright lineaments that coalesced, representing the landscape corresponding to each album title. The mesmerizing, contouring lines morphed exquisitely to complement the music of Bird’s violin.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It wasn’t until his debut of <em>Echolocations</em> came to a halt that Andrew Bird began to speak, enchanting the audience with his soft and somewhat carefree voice. He informed the crowd that he worked with NASA in order to contrive the rather hypnotic backdrop by using geodata to contrive a three-dimensional spatial render of the locations in which <em>Echolocations</em> (part one and two) were recorded.</p>\n<p>Bird then transitioned from<em> Echolocations</em> to what he considered a more traditional setting, inviting two of his other band members, drummer Abraham Rounds and guitarist Alan Hampton, to the stage. He enthused the audience with a seven-minute rendition of “Capsized”, accompanied by pleasing effervescent light transitions behind him. Bird confidently moved through several pieces, including “Why, Are You Serious,” Roma Fade” and an upbeat unreleased song.</p>\n<p>“Why,” one of his more popular songs, is revered for its dreamy tone and aloof vocals that blend fittingly with the song’s lyrics. He admitted the second-person narrative of the song that sings “How I wish it was your temper you were throwing / Damn you for being so easygoing” is actually a reflection on his own passivity. This comic self-deprecation roused laughter from the wholly involved crowd.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79211\" style=\"width: 1151px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1099169906\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79210\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79211\" data-attachment-id=\"79211\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/andrew-bird-soars-with-melodic-sounds-at-campbell/unnamed-47/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1141%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1141,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C934&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79211\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C934\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1141&amp;ssl=1 1141w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C808&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=974%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Bird topped the series of fan favorites with the quirky and generally adored “Roma Fade.” “That song is incredibly difficult to play,” Bird admitted at the end of “Roma Fade.” He then brusquely unplugged his electric violin and moved over to an intimate acoustic setup on the side of the stage.</p>\n<p>The next series of songs were an incredibly moving and expressive bunch, including “My Sister’s Tiny Hands,” “Orpheo” and “Three White Horses.” For these songs, the mood shifted to a more folkloric, tale-telling atmosphere. Bird showed clear emotional divestment through this acoustic performance; the soft vibrato of his violin allowed for an immense melodic anticipation.</p>\n<p>He ended the show with the highly awaited “Pulaski at Night.” Unfolding the story behind the song, Bird said, “It was [inspired by] a foreign exchange student visiting us from Thailand who said, ‘I want to see ‘Pulaski at Night.’ ” This statement was followed by bursts of laughter. Bird himself found this to be amusing because “Pulaski” is “a fascinating street that runs the whole length of Chicago and the whole west side — but it’s a tough street, he disclosed.</p>\n<p>I gave Bird a standing ovation at the conclusion of “Pulaski,” a song I had been waiting to hear all night. He thanked the crowd for a wonderful night and humbly walked off stage. My expectations were exceeded by his talent and capability to put on a fascinating show. But as I looked at T-shirts being sold near the exit, I heard the soft sigh of his violin return from inside. I quickly made my way back into the venue to witness Bird playing a cover of Neil Young’s “Harvest,” as well as his own “Danse Caribe.” Bird undoubtedly gave an exceptional show filled with finger-pickings, new songs, talented vocals and homages to favorite artists.</p>\n<p>I had a chance to speak with Jenny, a recent graduate and engineer as well as a six-year-long fan of Bird, after the show. She remarked that “Pulaski at Night” as well as <em>Echolocations: River </em>were a surprise to her, proving the ingenuity of Bird’s performances.</p>\n<p>Bird’s fans “bowed down” to his impressive sound-craft and engaging performance. I was personally amazed by the gentle yet incredibly passionate musicianship I experienced during the acoustic segment of the concert. His live songs were performed with a unique timbre, paralleled by recorded versions, giving an extremely genuine touch to the performance. The same way Bird is able to merge the manifestation of multiple instruments, he is able to mingle multiple genres into one whole.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

Santa Barbara Bowl on April 16 with musical guest, Børns. Known for hits like “Left Hand Free” and “Breezeblocks,” alt-J has since added more tracks to their roster of fun, festival music perfect for the laid-back beach lifestyle here in SB.</p>\n<p>Opening up the show will be the multi-talented singer-songwriter Børns. Originally from Michigan, Garrett Borns has been a creative force since age 10 when he was a professional magician and eventually worked his way up to receiving awards for his drawings and various other forms of visual art. At 19 he was even giving TED Talks, during which he’d perform original songs right on stage.</p>\n<p>Since making his first debut in 2015 with his album <em>Dopamine,</em> Børns has made his way onto the charts with hit singles like “Electric Love,” “American Money” and “10,000 Emerald Pools.” This past January, he released his second studio album, <em>Blue Madonna,</em> which features Lana Del Rey on multiple tracks and encompasses heavy themes of heartbreak, confusion and love. In addition to playing this show with alt-J, Børns will also be performing both weekends this year at Coachella.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a three-year period of no new music, alt-J is finally on the road again touring for their new album, <em>Relaxer, </em>which came out June 2nd of last year and was nominated for the Mercury Prize of 2017.</p>\n<p>While alt-J consider themselves “just guys from Leeds who muddled through it,” many seem to think otherwise; their music has been included in popular, high-grossing films like “Silver Linings Playbook,” “Captain America: Civil War” and others.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2008 as a simple college band self-producing music through GarageBand, alt-J has since grown into the indie sensation they are today, headlining their own tours and playing in various music festivals around the world.</p>\n<p>Although their new album contains only eight songs, alt-J’s most recent <em>Relaxer</em> represents a slight change and growth in the band’s musical abilities and direction. <em>Relaxer</em> differs from its predecessors as it incorporates darker themes and slower songs as seen in tracks like “3WW,” “Adeline,” “Last Year” and their cover of The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun.” However, don’t let this discourage you from listening as the album also features fun songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Hit Me Like That Snare” which are reminiscent of the classic alt-J sound made present in previous albums <em>This Is All Yours</em> and <em>An Awesome Wave</em>. Alt-J will also be performing both weekends of Coachella this year in case you can’t make the show here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Tickets are still available! They can be found online at <em>sbbowl.com</em> and range from $50-$60 in price.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6675,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6674,6673,6672],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
