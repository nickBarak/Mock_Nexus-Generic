Senate table five times in the last six years. Each time, the meeting ended without a divestment, leaving UCSB as the only undergraduate UC campus that has not passed a resolution in line with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s resolution is expected to be introduced at a Senate meeting within the next three weeks, according to Dylan Kupsh, an active member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and a candidate for the engineering senator position with the Isla Vista Party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh added that there is a “pretty big chance” the resolution will be introduced at this Wednesday’s Senate meeting, but declined to confirm an exact date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked which A.S. senators are going to officially author the resolution, Kupsh said the names will not be released until the day the resolution is introduced in order to protect the individuals’ safety. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had issues in the past around Canary Mission, specifically student groups posting signs with their names and being terrorists and associating them with terrorists,” Kupsh said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “They’ll put the student sponsor’s name and they’ll say they’re a terrorist, and they’ll flyer all around the freshmen dorms.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of SJP are primarily responsible for drafting the resolution, Kupsh said. SJP decided to release a feedback form for the first time this year in order to gather students’ opinions on the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At SJP, we think that A.S. really doesn’t voice a lot of the concerns of students, and so we wanted to bring students into the conversation on, like, how these resolutions work and to get more student input on this resolution, ’cause obviously the university investments affect everyone at this university,” Kupsh added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted students to have a voice in trying to make change on this university, so we thought to try to alleviate concerns about the divestment bill, it would be a good place to allow for student feedback on the bill itself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh said that SJP has taken into consideration the feedback that students have brought up about previous divestment resolutions and have used that to inform how they wrote this year’s resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest pieces of feedback SJP has gotten so far is to increase the number of sources they include in the resolution, Kupsh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP has also increased the number of companies to divest from and added several more clauses to explain why those companies are included.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh emphasized that the resolution is specifically targeting companies violating human rights and that the companies just happen to operate in Israel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At SJP, we really think this resolution isn’t really about religion; it’s about companies violating human rights,” Kupsh said. “It’s about Palestinians not being able to express what they want or having to fund their own oppression.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Winter Quarter 2019. <em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>O’Connor and Joanne Nowak, an academic coordinator at the Blum Center, advertised the minor to students at the minor’s first informational meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The meeting was attended by approximately 40 students.</p>\n<p>“I took History 74 with O’Connor. That’s how I first found out about the minor. I was interested in the minor partly because O’Connor is so awesome, but I’m also really interested in the material,” Wessal Esber, a first-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Although the minor is part of the Department of History, it will remain affiliated with the Blum Center, a network of organizations created by UC Regent Richard Blum dedicated to addressing global poverty through transdisciplinary and collaborative approaches.</p>\n<p>The Blum Center program first began in the fall of 2007 at UC Berkeley, but has expanded over the past 12 years to every UC campus.</p>\n<p>“The minor in Poverty, Inequality and Democracy is the pillar of the teaching component of the Blum Center. Completing this minor will prepare students to think in critical and informed ways about these issues, laying the foundation for effective action,” Charles Hale, dean of social sciences, said.</p>\n<p>History 74 — Poverty, Inequality, and Social Justice in a Historical and Global Perspective — is one of three core requirements for the minor.</p>\n<p>“The idea is that anyone from any department can take it. They don’t have to know any history, they don’t have to know anything about poverty, they’re there to learn about it from a historical and global perspective,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>After completing History 74, students must complete an internship requirement, which aims to help students apply concepts from the classroom to an organization. The internship can be completed through class 196SJ in the history department, UCDC, UC Sacramento, Education Abroad, a private organization by petition or through another department on campus.</p>\n<p>“The Blum Center is now working on developing internship relationships with organizations in the local community so that we can help students with placements and develop ongoing relationships with the organizations where we’re placing interns,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>“We want it to be a meaningful learning experience for the students, but also a meaningful experience for the organization.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Blum Center will cultivate a list of local internships for students in the minor to help connect them to long-term partner organizations.</p>\n<p>The final core requirement for the minor is a History 174Q, a capstone seminar for students who have completed the coursework and internship to reflect on their experience of the minor through a research paper or artistic project.</p>\n<p>“We want to use the resources of the Blum Center to make the minor a kind of space for people coming from a wide variety of interests from across the campus, from the sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences, who share an interest in this whole set of issues and who come together outside the classroom, outside their internships, to participate in workshops, our pop-up programs,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>In the future, the Blum Center plans to add a fellowship program for the minor’s students who attend and volunteer with the Blum Center programs outside of coursework.</p>\n<p>“I really feel that there’s a lot of energy on this campus for dealing with a whole range of issues that deal with inequality and social justice, not just from the lens of economic need and poverty, but other standpoints as well,” O’Connor added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Matt Kemp is out for the season, Hanley Ramirez broke a rib after being hit by a 96 mph fastball and Andre Ethier looks as rusty as he’s ever been after missing extended time with an injury.</p>\n<p>To top things off, the Dodgers had just lost the advantage of their trump card. After losing games one and two in which Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw pitched, L.A.’s greatest strength was nullified. L.A. couldn’t get across the key run in game one, wasting valuable scoring opportunities and losing in extra innings. The Dodger bats got even colder in game two, with the team failing to score a run and losing a great Kershaw start on a sacrifice fly. Yasiel Puig was hitless through the first two games, and Ramirez never got the chance to hit in a key situation with the Cardinals constantly pitching around him.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, Carl Crawford has been enjoying a power surge, accounting for the only two runs in game one for the Dodgers. It just wasn’t enough to overcome a deep and fundamentally sound St. Louis team. Ethier missed a ball in centerfield that was enough to nullify Greinke’s excellence and send the game to extras, and the Redbird crowd was ridculously loud in extra innings. Despite seeing the potential that got Los Angeles to the NLCS in the first place, it was St. Louis that kept doing the little things necessary to win the close games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Hyu-Jin Ryu going against St. Louis Cardinals’ ace Adam Wainwright, things were looking grim for the team that was favored to win the World Series weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, Ryu is no slouch. The South Korean native finished the regular season with 14 wins and a 3.00 ERA — impressive numbers that warrant Rookie of the Year considerations. However, Ryu was less than stellar in his first career postseason start, allowing six hits and four runs in three innings. Whether it was nerves or another injury that plagued Ryu, he did not look like himself.</p>\n<p>After getting swept in the first phase of games in St. Louis, L.A. rebounded in a big way upon their return to Chavez Ravine. Ryu pitched like the master control specialist we all knew he could be. His changeup was on point, painting the corners of the strike zone for seven flawless innings, and the Dodgers won 3-0 on Puig, Gonzales and Ramirez’s RBIs. The Dodgers got their clutch hits when they mattered, and the defense backed up Ryu for the shutout.</p>\n<p>At press time, the Los Angeles Dodgers face a 3-1 deficit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series with revitalized hope. Ryu’s reemergence assures that the Dodgers will get one more shot to throw an ace on the table, with Greinke slated to go in game five. One win in two games at home will give the ball back to Kershaw for game six.</p>\n<p>After a tremendous performance that ultimately resulted in a loss, Kershaw has his eyes set on nothing short of a perfect game in his next start, should it come about. That might be aiming high for any other pitcher in baseball, but not Kershaw’s. The numbers speak for themselves. An ERA of 1.83 puts Kershaw’s name up among the ranks of Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Bob Gibson and the ‘first coming’ of Kershaw, an old Dodger named Sandy Koufax. He has allowed less than one baserunner an inning, and every start in which the Dodgers do not win when he’s on the mound is considered a failure.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers went 42-8 over a 50-game stretch that began in June when the team was in last place. It started with the return of Ramirez from injury and the 10,000-watt jumpstart known as Puig. And so was the story when L.A. won game three on Monday. The parallelism is eerily similar.</p>\n<p>Call me optimistic, but I’m expecting something special. The team can take notes and watch video of the different stretches in the season to see what they did right and what they did wrong. And manager Don Mattingly will keep the atmosphere calm, collected and focused. The Dodgers are at their best when their hitters don’t try to do too much, get on base instead of swing for the fences and trust their teammates.</p>\n<p>Ricky Nolasco couldn’t hold his own on Tuesday night against Lance Lynn, but the Dodgers will be in prime position to pull off a three game upset with Greinke going at home in game five and Kershaw in a position to potentially pull even the series back in St. Louis.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is entirely skeptical. The Dodgers are still down and need to continue to figure out ways to win. In the first two games of the series, L.A. made mistakes and did not capitalize with runners in scoring position. But St. Louis made fielding mistakes in game three that prove they aren’t perfect. Make no mistake about it; the Dodgers will go as far as their pitching takes them. The offense is hit or miss, no pun intended, with all the injuries up and down the lineup.</p>\n<p>But L.A. has been in this position before. The situation following game two is too similar to where the team saw themselves in June. They overcame injuries and missed opportunities before, and now they know exactly how to do it again. The Cardinals are known to play mistake-free baseball, so the Dodgers will have to capitalize on their superior talent by matching them play for play. After overcoming St. Louis’ ace and getting back in this series, L.A. is buzzing for baseball once more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Art by Emily Zhang of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52490\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52490\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/","id":3235,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3234,3233,3232],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
