The children originate predominantly from Guatemala and then Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico respectively.</p>\n<p>The detention center is operated by a private contractor, <a href=\"https://discoverbcfs.net\">BCFS</a>, which is a “global system of health and human service nonprofit organizations with locations and programs across the U.S. and abroad,” according to the corporation’s website.</p>\n<p>While Carbajal said he believes the contractor is providing a “basic level of care,” he argued that it is not the right approach to this “self-imposed, developed crisis.”</p>\n<p>“They’re woken up at 5 a.m. after they were incarcerated and regimented, they’re rushed to showers and given less than five minutes at most,” Carbajal said in an interview with the Nexus. “Because this facility is in the desert, they’re only given 10-20 minutes of recreation once or twice a day.”</p>\n<p>“So clearly, these are not optimal, adequate conditions for children,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also noted there didn’t seem to be a clear system for children to file complaints regarding assault or other grievances.</p>\n<p>Among the 319 children being housed at this facility, 26 have been separated from their families, Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Although Carbajal is an original co-sponsor for the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3036/text\">Keep Families Together Act</a> within the House of Representatives, which puts limitations on the separation of families and sets deadlines for reunification, he said he is not hopeful about the likelihood of it passing due to the Republican control of the House, Senate and White House.</p>\n<p>While U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered on Tuesday that the process of family separations be ended and that children be reunited with their families within 30 days, Carbajal said he has not seen any concrete plans to do so.</p>\n<p>“This administration is now saying that they are going to reunite children but haven’t provided a shred of evidence or detail as to how they’re gonna go about doing that,” he said. “There’s a conflict of data between the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department of the custody of children. How many of them are there? Where are they? How are they going to reunite them? It’s all a big question mark.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also visited the United States port of entry in El Paso and questioned Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers about the current procedures in place for migrants who come to the border seeking asylum.</p>\n<p>Carbajal was disappointed by the lack of information he was provided, stating that he questioned the officers “without sufficient answers.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The answers you’re seeking, I was seeking, and clearly they’re not providing them,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Carbajal said he was told by the CBP and the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (I.C.E.) officials that children were being kept at a facility at the border — not Tornillo — for longer than the three-day limit due to the lack of coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).</p>\n<p>“They’re violating the human rights of these children based on U.S. law. And the I.C.E. officials admitted that to me,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>The presence of I.C.E. has been criticized at UC Santa Barbara — specifically, the compliance of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) under Sheriff Bill Brown with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">publicly positioned himself</a> against Senate Bill 54, which designates that local and state law agencies not work with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Amidst calls to abolish I.C.E., Carbajal said he stands for stricter “oversight and inquiry” of the agency’s enforcement actions and says I.C.E. “indiscriminately” targets undocumented individuals rather than individuals who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the abolishment of I.C.E…. this is a larger conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal instead argues that the current immigration system needs to be comprehensively reformed on a national level, calling the current system “broken.” Only after this reformation will all the issues that fall under the umbrella of illegal immigration be addressed and resolved, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m an immigrant myself. I immigrated to this country when the immigration system worked better.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal commends the individuals who are speaking out about their “discontent and their opposition” ahead of the Families Belong Together march planned for Saturday at 11 a.m. in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We need to stay vigilant, and make sure that we press this administration. The reason they’re modifying this policy a little bit is because there’s been public outrage throughout the country, and people should continue to express themselves,” Carbajal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Angeles, Orange, Plumas, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Sutter, Tehama, Ventura and Yuba.</p>\n<p>Any individual from those 14 counties enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

recent fires.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of California residents are trying to piece their lives back together even as these wildfires continue blazing,” said Brandon Lipps, the acting deputy of Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, in a <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2018/025118\">press release</a> sent out last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“This waiver will allow residents more flexibility to use in feeding their families as they get back on their feet.”</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, those in the program can only purchase cold foods, such as bread, cereal, fruits, vegetables, dairy products and meats, as stipulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website.</p>\n<p>S.N.A.P. benefits typically cannot be used to buy alcoholic beverages, pet foods, soaps, household supplies, vitamins, medicines and hot foods among other restrictions.</p>\n<p>Hot foods are the only temporary exception on the aforementioned list.</p>\n<p>The department will also provide “mass replacement of SNAP benefits” for those who experienced food losses due to power outages in the Butte and Plumas counties, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>There are currently five fires burning

Tuesday, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>After confirming the existence of the remains, which consisted of a head and torso, Santa Barbara County Fire water rescue was then alerted to aid with the recovery of the remains.</p>\n<p>Deputies later found what are suspected to be associated remains – a femur, fibula and tibia – early Thursday morning near UCSB’s Campus Point, according to a second press release sent out Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>The body is “in a significant state of decomposition and incomplete,” Huddle said in the initial press release.</p>\n<p>SBSO is currently unable to identify the age, sex and identity of the remains.</p>\n<p>The office is currently working with the Department of Justice to gather DNA evidence and compare the records of missing persons in the Tri-County area, according to the second press release.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Coroner’s Office is investigating the cause of death.</p>\n<p>Based on dental records, the decedent does not
