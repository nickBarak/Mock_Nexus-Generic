CSD) reached out to Lucidity about a festival designed to steer people away from Del Playa Drive and increase safety precautions during Deltopia, Lucidity presented its plan to the I.V. CSD board in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\">early October</a>. Since then, the I.V. CSD has been engaged in negotiations with various community stakeholders — law enforcement, UC Santa Barbara, County Public Works and Lucidity — to determine the feasibility and necessity of the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late October, Lucidity cut the budget for the proposal </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by $20,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, following district concerns that the price tag for the festival would be too much for the district to shoulder alone. Lucidity also hosted a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/lucidity-fields-community-questions-about-alternative-deltopia-festival-during-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early November to answer questions and clear misconceptions regarding the festival, emphasizing that its purpose is to channel crowds away from Del Playa Drive into a safer space, not to replace Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In mid-November, the I.V. CSD delayed its decision on the proposal to December after noting a number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/i-v-csd-vote-for-lucidity-festival-on-deltopia-postponed-to-december/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“outstanding issues”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the contract, particularly with the police presence needed at the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t think that on the current timeline we’ll be able to accomplish our goals and so it’s one of those things where we should not pull the trigger if we’re not 100% sped-up and ready,” Board President Spencer Brandt said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel that the best way to move forward is to set a target date for 2021 and to move forward with [the] group of stakeholders,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, stressed the timeliness of the plan’s approval when it was first proposed in October, so that preparations could be made in time for the spring. She had hoped for a contract’s approval in a week’s time, but negotiations with various parties stretched to more than a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the delay, however, “Lucidity is at the point where they’re willing to step back and withdraw their proposal for this year and try to work with us to try and find where best they can be plugged in,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that although plans for the spring festival were pushed back to 2021, the I.V. CSD intends to work with UCSB to host an alternative event in I.V., such as the university’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/police-ucsb-administration-local-government-prepare-for-deltopia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a festival held in Storke Plaza as an alternative to Deltopia for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, said he is in contact with Katya Armistead, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of student life, to potentially open SunFest to I.V. residents who don’t attend UCSB, but the I.V. CSD still needs to meet with both UCSB and Lucidity to see where the two entities stand on the idea, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will still be in the picture and the I.V. CSD has “spoken with them about the possible use of the Guardians,” a security team focused on harm reduction, for a possible “alternative event in Isla Vista this year,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the original proposal to the I.V. CSD, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardianteam.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardians</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played a key role in emphasizing the need for safety precautions for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Craig Bonner, chief deputy for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, the office is “absolutely dedicated” to turning Deltopia into a safer event and is willing to help put safety measures in place for this upcoming Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything we can do to help mitigate the unsanctioned aspects of Deltopia is a good thing and obviously if we can get people into a controlled environment where they are safe, that is an excellent thing,” Bonner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The negotiations for the spring festival opened a much larger conversation on the safety issues seen at large events in I.V. and the I.V. CSD’s ability in tackling them, Brandt said at Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While these are fun events for many of our residents, there are many of our residents that are made to be victims by crime, by sexual assault during these large events and there is an abnormally high number of people who are hospitalized as a result of alcohol and drugs during these events,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw a spike in attendees, citations and arrests, but a decrease in medical transports; the majority of arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Deltopia is] one of the biggest public safety issues in our community and it’s also something that is absolutely revered by so many of the people who live here. It’s a tricky line to walk, but we have to be resolute in bringing these issues forward,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 14, 12:53 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Lucidity first proposed the plan to the I.V. CSD in early October. The I.V. CSD had reached out to Lucidity requesting a festival production consultation prior to October and Lucidity then created and brought the festival proposal to the I.V. CSD board in October.

At the end of the first inning the Gauchos were up 2-0.</p>\n<p>The overall offensive explosion from UCSB was highlighted by three-run performances in the second, fifth, and eighth innings.</p>\n<p>A single from sophomore Armani Smith was able to move freshman Marcos Castanon to second base for freshman Andrew Martinez’s at-bat partially through the second inning. The designated hitter knocked a three-run blast to score Smith and Castanon, allowing Martinez to join a three player tie for the team season lead with five home runs.</p>\n<p>Junior Michael McAdoo piled onto the six-run lead in the fifth inning, hitting his own three-run home run to straightaway centerfield off of CSUN freshman Wesley Moore. A walk from junior Thomas Rowan and a center field single from Cole Mueller put them on first and second and the three RBIs for McAdoo was his second time this season. The lead increased to nine runs at the end of five innings.</p>\n<p>The final three-run inning for UCSB came in the eighth, with Castanon beginning the inning with a single to left center field. Smith came up to the plate a couple of batters later and hit a fly ball over the Matador center fielder’s head, who played a bad route to the ball. Castanon and freshman Jason Willow, who was hit by a pitch, would come around to score on Smith’s double to make the grand total 12-0.</p>\n<p>Ledesma was outstanding in his start for the Gauchos giving up six hits and getting seven strikeouts for the game’s duration. The 6-2 record for the starter is the best in the pitching rotation for UCSB, and tied for fourth in the Big West, and he has now picked up the victory in three consecutive starts.</p>\n<p>In a postgame interview, Ledesma commented on his successful day praising his defense saying, “If you’re getting strikes and guys are making plays behind you that makes throwing strikes so much easier because you don’t have to worry about balls in the holes that they’re not making plays on. Them making plays makes my job a lot more easier.”</p>\n<p>The complete game effort was Ledesma’s sixth quality start of the season as the pitcher has rarely failed to put in six full innings of work this year.</p>\n<p>The quantity of innings he has thrown is matched by the quality of his pitching as well, as Ledesma currently sits in second place in the conference in ERA with a stellar 2.16. The impressive performance from the senior was just his latest in a recent run that has seen him rise up in the ranks and look to be an effective tool for UCSB as they inch closer to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts message to his team remains one of quiet persistence explaining, “For this particular group we’ve handled failure better than we’ve handled success … it’ll be another battle for us tomorrow and I’m looking forward to see their response. I want to see some intent with want they do and some maturity with how they go about their business from when they walk in the park”.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the final game of the series against the CSUN Matadors at home on Sunday, May 5 at 1 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/","id":4282,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4281,4280,4279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball Fever: UCSB Begins 2018 Season on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team will look to put behind the disappointment of last season as it begins a new campaign this weekend with a three-game series versus San Diego State.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81005\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"577908644\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81147\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81005\" data-attachment-id=\"81005\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/baseball-fever-ucsb-begins-2018-season-on-the-road/ben-brecht-pitches-for-a-strikeout-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ben Brecht pitches for a strikeout.

That playoff run was truly a Cinderella story, one that ended too soon, without an NCAA championship, but gave much hope for the future.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward one year later, and if 2016 was a Cinderella story, then 2017 for UCSB was a fall back to reality.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into 2017, Santa Barbara was expected to finish at least third in the conference and was actually ranked coming into the year at No. 19 in the country. Of course, nothing went as expected.

While Checketts is known for his ability to build a solid pitching staff, injuries played a huge factor in the Gauchos’ inability to put together a solid rotation for the entirety of the campaign.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team last year, the Gauchos bullpen accumulated a 5.24 ERA, the second-worst mark in the Big West. That mark was also ranked 183 out of the 295 NCAA D-I programs. This year, UCSB hopes to turn this around as it returns some good arms while also adding a couple to the rotation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior right-handed pitcher Noah Davis returns for his third year at Santa Barbara, one he hopes can bring some health to his résumé. As the primary Friday starter last season, the Huntington Beach native posted a 7-4 record in 13 starts with a 4.63 ERA.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He finished with a career-high in strikeouts with 65 but did battle injuries throughout the year. If all is well health-wise, Davis should resume as the Friday starter.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with him, the bullpen returns midweek starter, Ben Brecht. The true sophomore posted a 3.99 ERA in 14 appearances, eight of them starts along with tallying a 4-2 record. Another key returner is Chris Lincoln. In 28 innings, the sophomore gave up 31 hits and 15 earned runs, but showcased a well of talent in the strikeout department, tallying 25.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Brecht and Lincoln will hope to showcase more talent this year, fans seem to know what to expect out of senior right-hander Stevie Ledesma. The backyard kid, plucked from SBCC, was always the first call in a decisive game and he didn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though his 2-5 record is a bit disappointing, the senior tallied 57 strikeouts in just 43.2 innings pitched. Of course, with a lot of strikeouts comes to a lot of opportunities to hit some stuff at the plate. Ledesma had a 6.80 ERA and gave up six dingers, tied for second-most on the team.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newcomers to the pen are redshirt freshman Jack Dashwood and Chris Troye. Dashwood was the cream of the crop of a wonderful recruiting class two seasons ago but sat out the 2017 campaign due to injury.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Troye, his story is a bit more interesting. Brought in as a catcher, the true freshman has shown some ability to be a pitcher. The Brentwood native has pitched to speeds of 97 mph, showing promise. Now let’s see if he can put it together in a real game.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batting wise, the Gauchos are also in a precarious position. UCSB lost two of its top three batters in terms of batting average including Austin Bush, whose 20 home runs set a new program record last season.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Santa Barbara still retains a lot of talent. Redshirt sophomore Tommy Jew batted .295 last season and had the second most RBI’s on the team with 30. The center fielder is also very talented defensively, thus setting the stage for him to have a breakout year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of a breakout year, sophomore Armani Smith is due for one big time. The outfielder showed tremendous promise last season batting .285 and slugging .397, but even more, promising is how hard his swing is.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other key returners are the Louisville slugger Sam Cohen, who had eight home runs last season, and shortstop Clay Fisher, who will not be playing the field until his shoulder has completely healed but will see some action at the plate as a DH.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team who stands in the way of the Gauchos on opening weekend is San Diego State, a team who won 42 games last season and a Mountain West Championship.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aztecs are in the same position as the Gauchos were last season, hoping to exceed expectations following a tremendous season. Defeating UCSB in a best of three series to begin the year would be a good gauge of where the team is at early, something the coach himself alluded to.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior shortstop David Hensley and sophomore right-handed pitcher Logan Boyer are two notable returners for the Aztecs and were also named to the 2018 all-MW preseason team. The team was picked to finish second.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Gauchos will be facing a tough team to open the season, the most important thing for them is working on what they can get better at. This early in the season, nothing is set in stone. This is a team that is comprised of solid returners, but if it wants to excel, it needs another Armani Smith to step up in their first year of collegiate action.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what happens this weekend, one thing is for certain; Checketts and the team have put last year behind them. With that brings hope that we can be cheering this team on at Omaha come mid-June.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB opens its season against San Diego State at 6 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 16 at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
