Crawford gave a lecture on modern technology and the mind Tuesday night in Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, Crawford’s talk, “The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction,” discussed a phenomenon called the “crisis of attention,” which explores the distractive capabilities of modern day technology and reliance on social media for purposes of comfort and confidence. Crawford’s goal is to convince individuals, particularly youth, to be more aware of their surroundings and less consumed by technological distractions such as television and cellular devices.</p>\n<p>According to Crawford, societal pressures exist that encourage people to stay up-to-date with trends and popular entertainment as opposed to such topics such as classic literature. Crawford said engrossment with modern technology has been “normalized.”</p>\n<p>“I’d be sitting down on my comfortable couch about to read Plato and rediscover my love for complex philosophy,” Crawford said. “I would read a few pages, realize that my favorite TV show is on, so I switch on the TV and now I’m not a societal freak and can talk to some people about it. If I just read Plato and tried to talk to someone about the next day, they’d think I was a bit of a freak.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said ‘”distractibility” is facilitated by technology and provides a colorful, attractive world as opposed to a dull world without the distractions.</p>\n<p>“The more we delve into these distractions, whether it be Facebook or Candy Crush or whatnot, we start to view the normal world as more bland and tasteless,” Crawford said. “It doesn’t offer the same amount of fun and entertainment that your marshmallow treat phone application has. So then we get hungry for it, and we go running back to our phones.”</p>\n<p>Crawford also said self-esteem and sense of worth is tied to the attention users of social media get on social media sites.</p>\n<p>“To be distracted is to be entertained and awed by all these fake experiences,” Crawford said. “Our self-dignity depends on social media which then creates a fragile self, which makes us dependent on constructed experiences to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>Goleta resident Michael Jung said as a teacher he often encountered students who were unable to detach themselves from technology and relied on phone applications to solve problems.</p>\n<p>“I taught high school [trigonometry] and I just couldn’t believe how many kids would just sit and play on their phones if I left them alone,” Jung said. “One girl even asked why we need to learn math if there’s ‘an app for that.’ To be educated, that’s why!”</p>\n<p>Jung also said he found it refreshing to see young people take interest in activities and experiences other than technology.</p>\n<p>“When I see people actually take an interest in other things — traditional art, music, dancing — I feel better,” Jung said. “I know technology hasn’t consumed every part of their life.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Margaret Rhiner said she believes youth need to be reminded to enjoy their physical environment and interact with people around them.</p>\n<p>“They don’t realize it anymore, or maybe they’re just numb to their surroundings,” Rhiner said. “I go to the beach and I’m baffled to see all these kids on their phones instead of admiring the water or playing in the sand. Young people don’t talk to people anymore and they’re all obsessed about the next big invention.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said students should take advantage of campus and its surrounding scenery while they still have the opportunity.</p>\n<p>“If you’re a UCSB student, you’re living on the edge of the Pacific Ocean,” Crawford said. “You will never, ever, live anyplace like this again. I mean, unless you’re a billionaire or something. I think of a 20-year-old walking on the beach with his head stuck in Facebook and it just breaks my heart. Live a little. It’s worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/","id":2845,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2844,2843,2842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel","biography":"Not available","articles":[999,2610,2699,2798,2804,2838,2843,2845,2887,2901,2922,2950,2967,2968,2985,3445,4573,4652,4658,4659,4679,4680,4697,4804,4816],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Students Travel to Ferguson for Alternative Spring Break","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Community Affairs Board (CAB), an official board of the Associated Students Legislative Council comprised of students who do community service events, went on a trip to Ferguson, Missouri, during spri...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Community Affairs Board (CAB), an official board of the Associated Students Legislative Council comprised of students who do community service events, went on a trip to Ferguson, Missouri, during spring break to conduct community service in the city. </p>\n<p>During their trip to Missouri, students conducted street clean-up and personally spoke to members of the local community about police brutality, institutional racism and how the municipal court system in St. Louis county allegedly has a strong policing for profit undertone. CAB’s visit was prompted by the wake of violent protests sparked by the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August of last year.  </p>\n<p>Third-year political science and philosophy double major major and Alternative Breaks co-coordinator coordinator Jeremiah Copeland said the event was entirely different from other CAB events he has attended due to its social justice focus and level of personal engagement with local community members. </p>\n<p>“I thought that the trip was very powerful and a great experience,” Copeland said. “The social justice aspect of the trip was something completely different than CAB has ever really done before, so it was a refreshing experience.” </p>\n<p>Copeland said he has been on other alternative spring breaks, but this trip was more focused on social justice work and remolding systems of power for positive change. </p>\n<p>“I have been on an alternative break to Colorado for flood relief and Oakland to work with foster youth and at food banks,” Copeland said. “Those were more volunteer oriented, and this Ferguson trip was more learning about the multitude of issues that are affecting the area and what we can do to help.” </p>\n<p>Copeland also said the alleged presence of racism in law enforcement in the nation is an issue that must be dealt with on a local and federal level. </p>\n<p>“I think that the Michael Brown case has brought to bright light the racism that is present in many police departments across the nation. It must be stopped,” Copeland said. </p>\n<p>CAB member and first-year Xuewen Sherry Li said the said the situation in Ferguson was upsetting but sparked a vital impetus change in the nation.  </p>\n<p>“It’s sad that this many lives had to end before the silence was broken, but I think awareness and solidarity has brought people from all across the country together,” Li said. </p>\n<p>According to Li, the trip was an impactful experience for her and for all Gaucho participants. </p>\n<p>“It was absolutely amazing, this trip has made me realize that I don’t have to get on a plane to make an impact,” Li said. “All around me are breaches that can be fixed and voices to fight for.”<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/","id":2842,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2841,2840,2839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Arbor Mural Assembled","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_62221\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62221\" data-attachment-id=\"62221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/new-arbor-mural-assembled/the-wall_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428481197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Wall_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=658%2C400\" alt=\"Originally assembled at UCI in 2012, the mural has been transferred to and displayed on college campuses as far as UC Berkeley and Arizona State University.

The wall seeks to encourage discussion on the Palestine/Israel conflict, though some students have expressed concerns it does not represent multiple viewpoints.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) constructed a mural wall in the Arbor on Monday to remain until tomorrow that displays artwork and messages illustrating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the West Bank and Gaza Strip region.</p>\n<p>The wall was originally constructed by SJP at UC Irvine in 2012 and has since been transferred to multiple university campuses, including UC Berkeley, UC Merced, Stanford, Arizona State University and the Claremont Colleges, to promote a UC resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Palestine/Israel. The Associated Students External Affairs Committee will consider this campus’s divestment resolution at its 6 p.m. meeting today after tabling the proposal at its meeting last week.</p>\n<p>Second-year music major and SJP member Daniel Moltke said the wall was built in order to spark discussion among the campus community about the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and Gaza as well as to inform interested students on the current divestment resolution.</p>\n<p>“We want them to know there is this divestment campaign happening these weeks and that the vote will hopefully be happening Wednesday,” Moltke said. “Our main objective is to spread awareness and let people know that there’s something we can do about it and something we can do about it right now.”</p>\n<p>Third-year history major and SJP member Aaron Reveles said the wall travels to different campuses each spring quarter or semester in order to educate UC students statewide about the UC’s financial holdings in corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, which all allegedly profit from Israeli government policies in the Palestine/Israel region.</p>\n<p>“This is a communal wall that travels to different campuses,” Reveles said. “We drove down to the last school it was at, which was Pitzer College in [Pomona], with a U-Haul truck we rented out. A group of us worked hard and put it together.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, the UC divestment campaign regarding Palestine/Israel reflects a similar past UC resolution calling on an end to apartheid in South Africa.</p>\n<p>“There’s people that were big in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, who mentioned specifically the UC’s divesting was a significant part in the turnaround of their movement,” Moltke said. “So we hope that by getting all of the UC’s on the same page, we can get the regents to stop funding these corporations that perpetuate violence and oppression.”</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum said while he believes the wall facilitates political discussion, its messages do not represent multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I’m so happy I’m on a campus like UCSB that facilitates free speech,” Tannenbaum said. “I think that it’s great this wall is up and that it’s starting political discourse. But I really wish … that there had been some form of collaboration, or this wall had shown two sides of the story … I believe it really, really does not.”</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also said the campaigns associated with the wall represent an “affront” to Jewish self-determination.</p>\n<p>“On this board it says Zionism equals racism … the general definition of Zionism is the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people free from persecution with the right of self-determination,” Tannenbaum said. “Saying that idea is racism — the existence of a Jewish state is racism — personally affronts my belief in the idea that I can have a place as a Jew where I am free from persecution.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, despite the presence of the wall, Palestinian students often feel victimized and afraid to voice their opinions at public forums due to potentially consequential future circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There are Palestinians who are afraid to speak at these public meetings because someone pro-Israel can record them and send it to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” Moltke said.</p>\n<p>Moltke said SJP student groups across the UC feel compelled to display the wall and spark discussion among students because of the challenges Palestinians face expressing free speech abroad.</p>\n<p>“The Israeli government won’t let you into Palestine if you’re pro-divestment or anti-Israel. There are no airports in Palestine so you have to go through Israel and if students speak out,” Moltke said, “they may never get to see their families in Palestine. So it’s up to us to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Hannah Ellenhorn however said she does not agree with the wall and its illustrations supporting divestment, and believes that the resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Palestine/Israel area is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“At the core of the conflict is a refusal for Arab populations to recognize the right of Jewish self-determination in Judea and Samaria,” Ellenhorn said. “The recent move for college campuses to boycott Jewish-owned businesses based in Israel is nothing more than blatant Jew-hatred masked in a degenerate view of social justice.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year computer engineering major Nader Khalil, however, United States’ corporations should cut funding to companies profiting from human rights violations everywhere in the world, no matter who the perpetrators or victims are.</p>\n<p>“Human rights on all scales are important,” Khalil said. “I see the West Bank Settlements as an issue. There is hate from both sides. A practical solution would be to cut American funding of these Israeli settlements and other war crimes that were committed on Gaza. Have a fair trial for the crimes that happen and move from there.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Tannenbaum stating “Zionism equals racism…the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people.” Tannenbaum actually defined Zionism as the belief in a nation for the Jewish people.

Perennial top-tier teams such as USC and LMU were also in the mix of college teams recruiting him, as well as many professional scouts.</p>\n<p>After graduating Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, Calif., the Baltimore Orioles drafted Young in the 25th round of the 1994 draft, yet he chose to enroll at UCSB on an athletic scholarship instead.</p>\n<p>Young struggled his freshman season with a .239 batting average and was forced to switch defensive positions when he first arrived at UCSB. Brontsema and the Gaucho coaching staff succeeded in transforming a high school outfielder into a first-team, All-Big West shortstop and third baseman throughout the three years Young was a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“The defensive switch was an important move, and the right move for his career,” Brontsema said.</p>\n<p>Young would eventually prove Brontsema’s tactics to be of value, as he went on to win the Golden Glove award for one of the best defensive players in the MLB while playing shortstop for the Rangers.</p>\n<p>“It was a great accomplishment for him,” Brontsema said. “The award is a testament to his work ethic and drive.”</p>\n<p>Young will use what he learned during his time walking the fields of Caesar Uyesaka stadium today, at AT&amp;T park as a Texas Ranger.
