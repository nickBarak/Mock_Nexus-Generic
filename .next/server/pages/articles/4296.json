DILFS AND MILFS</strong></p>\n<p>Can’t have the weekend without some live music! Idle Riot will be playing this Friday night, with Fencer opening for them at 9 p.m. The theme of the night is “Dilfs and Milfs,” so attendees are urged to dress up as their favorite “dilf/milf.” Both are rock bands; Idle Riot is based in Isla Vista, while Fencer will be coming up from L.A. to perform. The show will be held at 6610 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FIND MEANING IN GLEANING </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never heard the term gleaning before; gleaning is a term that means picking produce from harvest that would otherwise be unpicked and perish. Join Zero Waste Committee, FoodCycling and Environmental Affairs Board for their first gleaning event of the quarter this Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They will be taking students to glean in the Montecito community. Carpooling will be arranged. Those interested can sign up at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning\">tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>HELP THE HOMELESS</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you need community service hours or just want to help out those around you, head to the El Dorado community lounge this Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m. The University Undergrad Apartments will be putting together care packages for houseless individuals. A light breakfast will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>HIKE TO THE SEVEN FALLS</strong></p>\n<p>Stretch your legs with Environmental Affairs Board on a hike to Seven Falls this Sunday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The trail is one of the easier hikes, spanning three miles and multiple waterfalls. Depending on conditions, there may even be a natural waterslide, WHAT????!!!! Organizers ask that those interested in participating fill out a short Google form that can be found on the event page. Go have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>YA LIKE BRUNCH? YA LIKE YOGA?</strong></p>\n<p>Grab your yoga mat and head over to the Isla Vista Food Cooperative at 9:45 a.m. this Sunday for their monthly event, Beach Brunch Yoga. The event includes an hour-long yoga class on the bluffs overlooking the ocean followed by a light brunch. This month, the brunch will be set up as a “build a bowl” where participants can create an açai bowl with granola and superfood toppings. The brunch theme will vary each month of the year. Participants must pay a $5 fee at the Co-Op from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. any day before the event to sign up. Those who do not show up on time at 10 a.m. may lose their spot unless they call ahead of time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily

will open in the near future. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">212F Hotpot, which for months has sported a storefront sign at 6533 Trigo Road, will open by the end of May at the latest, owner David Chen told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restaurant will be the first personal hot pot restaurant in the area. While the cuisine is Chinese, the theme is not to be confused with regular Chinese hot pot, which provides patrons with a family-style pot at the middle of the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, 212F Hotpot will give each restaurant-goer a personal pot of boiling soup, so customers can dine individually. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the menu items will be soup-based – broths of beef, seafood and the like will be available to order in a semi-sit-down format. Chen is toying with the idea of takeout, but the idea is to give I.V. residents a spot to sit down and enjoy their dinner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen hasn’t decided the restaurant’s hours of operation. After opening, it will stay open until 10 or 11 p.m., but he might decide to close earlier or later depending on the restaurant’s initial popularity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If customers want to come, we’ll serve them any time,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Chen’s third eatery in the area. He also owns PokeMee, a poke restaurant, and Choppa Rollin’ Ice Cream, a Thai rolled ice cream store, both of which are found on Hollister Avenue in Goleta. The two shops offer niche products in an area mostly bereft of non-generic Asian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen will change the name of PokeMee to Choppa Poke in the near future, due to a name dispute with a poke restaurant in Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal hot pot will provide a “whole new concept” of hot pot cuisine to the community, Chen highlighted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many restaurants in I.V. are staples, some close down quickly after opening. A number of joints have shut down shop in the past few years, including Otaco, El Sitio, La Cantina, Santa Ynez Burrito and Kol’s Cafe — the last of which is the predecessor to 212F Hotpot’s location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the problem is the food itself, some is the type of food,” Chen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hoping to be a staple,” added manager Will Groman, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara just last quarter. Groman worked at PokeMee before Chen hired him to be a part of 212F Hotpot from the ground up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In I.V. there aren’t many places where you can sit down for 30 minutes,” Groman said. “You order and take it to go home. It’d be nice to have an atmosphere where people can come, sit down and be lively.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen moved to Santa Barbara County in 2016 after noticing that the area had no poke restaurants. He used money from his existing e-commerce company to fund the startup costs. Since then, he has launched several restaurants, 212F Hotpot being the third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming months, he said, he plans to open a State Street shop that sells both poke and Thai ice cream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a background in sales, Chen stressed there is no one good way to pitch people on the hot pot joint. Instead, he offered a catch-all line to interested consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s new, so come try it out,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/","id":4295,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4294,4293,4292],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
