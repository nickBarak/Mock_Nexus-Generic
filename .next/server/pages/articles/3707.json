CSD pictured at the first meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that first meeting, I really remember the feeling of the weight of 50 years of activism on our shoulders,” Bertrand said. “People had fought for this for so long, and there had been so many efforts and so much love for this community that went into this long-term movement to create a local government.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inaugural board was composed of seven members: Bertrand, Vice President Natalie Jordan, Secretary Brandt and Directors Jay Freeman, Robert Geis, Father Jon Hedges and George Thurlow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the board’s seven members, five are elected. The other two seats are appointed by UCSB and Santa Barbara County to represent their respective interests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the district first formed, Bertrand was a student at Santa Barbara City College, while Brandt ‘19 and Jordan ‘18 were students at UCSB. Two long-term I.V. residents, entrepreneur Jay Freeman ‘03 and local reverend Father Jon Hedges, also won elected seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geis, a retired county official, and Thurlow ‘73, a university administrator, hold the appointed positions. Both are long-term Santa Barbara residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand and Brandt both said the different generations represented on the board, specifically the “diversity of viewpoints,” formed a more cohesive board, with Brandt pointing specifically to Geis’ years of previous experience in local government as an advantage the board would not have had otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the big disadvantages of being young in local government spaces, which are predominantly older and whiter and more traditional, is that you don’t really have the context for a lot of things and why certain things are set up the way that they are and how to best go about things to achieve the outcome that you want,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud ‘14, former Associated Students President and SBCC Board Trustee, took over as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">district’s interim general manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2017 and as the permanent general manager in December 2018. The position of interim general manager was created to account for the district’s unexpectedly small budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-13/i-v-csd-shakes-up-board-leadership/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeded Bertrand as president in December</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Jordan </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/term-in-review-i-v-csd-vice-president-natalie-jordan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has since left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was replaced by new director Kristie Nguyen; Geis is now vice president, and the secretary position was eliminated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FUNDING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district faced several crippling impediments at its formation, but none more so than one that loomed for nearly two years after its creation: a lack of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board theoretically had the power to implement programs and make changes around I.V., it didn’t have the funding to do so. An eight percent utility tax on I.V. residents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed in the 2016 election, with only 62% of residents voting yes.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It needed 66.66% of the vote to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darcél Elliott had managed the campaigns for both the district and its accompanying tax. When the district passed but the funding failed, Elliott pointed to campaigns by I.V. property owners who had vocally opposed the tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this election, fear won over hope,” Elliott said on election night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district’s funds would come from a yearly $200,000 grant from UCSB, but the money could only be spent on services the university agreed were useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the district failed to secure a tax by 2023, it would cease to exist, a deadline that haunted the newly formed district. So when the board placed a new tax on the June 2018 ballot, local campaigners ramped up their efforts to win voter approval. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-83520\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the “Vote Yes on Measure R” campaign celebrate after learning of the passing of the tax. (Pictured left to right: Ethan Bertrand, Emily Murray, Spencer Brandt and Jonathan Abboud.) <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 80% of Isla Vistans would vote to provide the district funding through </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a measure that was nearly identical to its failed predecessor, Measure F. Measure R promised improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75% vs. 17.25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eight percent tax has brought an influx of cash into the district. The district ended its 2018-2019 fiscal year with nearly half a million in spending compared to over $800,000 in income – a far cry from what it started out with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next fiscal year, the district </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-19/i-v-csd-budget-sees-about-200000-increase-in-funding-for-next-fiscal-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects a $200,000 increase in funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rounding up to more than $1 million, according to numbers released by the district in May. </span></p>\n<p><b>THE CSD’S FIRST SERVICES: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent revenue, the district spent its first year setting up as many services as possible with its limited resources, which involved “lots of strong partnerships with other government agencies and non-profit service providers,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board’s first project was expanding community policing efforts. Community Service Organization (CSO) safety officers have always escorted students home on weekend nights, but the district worked with UCSB to set up in-person stations at streetside locations for students to seek help.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSOs — who almost always are UCSB students themselves — worked over 3,000 hours and provided over 300 escorts during the last academic year, according to numbers released in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re there not to enforce, but to help people, to give out water, to help people charge their phones, to give people an escort home and when there is a safety concern, they’re there to call it into the police,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD has also focused on sexual violence-related issues, hiring the first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work within the UCPD and partnering with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) to set up a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the district’s most recent initiatives is a community-led beautification program, where I.V. residents can report graffiti, trash, vandalism or lighting issues to the district. The district will then either send out workers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">houseless community members they hired to tackle these issues </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or forward the requests to the county if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community,” Brandt said at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program’s launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHERE THE CSD HAS STRUGGLED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directors have acknowledged that the board, in its first iteration, struggled to reflect the demographics of I.V.’s population – six of the seven board members are male, and Bertrand was the only person of color on the board until Nguyen replaced Jordan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen is still the only woman on the board, and Bertrand is the only member that identifies as LGBTQ+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I say this as a straight white guy – it’s a huge problem that it’s only people who look like me who feel most empowered to get involved in local government,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We benefit so much from the perspective and the leadership of women and people of color, and it is really something that we, speaking for myself and for all of us, really try to encourage the next generation of leaders to reflect that and would like to see a more diverse board in the future.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand emphasized that the board did vote a “gay man of color” as its first president and a woman as its vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district has also stalled on its promise of a low-income exception to the tax, which it campaigned on ahead of the June 2018 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last fall, more than four months after the tax had passed, the directors were still split on whether or not to implement the exemption, with some directors arguing that residents could expose loopholes to avoid the tax. The board has still not addressed implementing the promised exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9, 2018 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the district has also failed to substantively address the issue of parking in I.V. — an issue it was formed to tackle. Parking in I.V. remains one of the biggest downsides to living in the tightly-packed neighborhood, with limited parking attached to houses and even fewer open spots available on the street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street parking in I.V. can also be dangerous; numerous students have posted on social media about windows being smashed and mirrors removed by drunk cyclists or a baseball bat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During larger events like Deltopia or Halloween, the university actively encourages students to purchase parking passes to move their cars out of I.V. and remove valuables from their cars. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the broader parking issue, I think that’s been one of those issues where everyone has made it very clear to us that it’s a difficult problem to solve, and that if we’re gonna do anything on it, we need to have the internal staff capacity to be able to put something together that actually works,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the future, we really need to have a professional come in and assess the situation and make some strong recommendations.” </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is tackling what is probably its biggest project yet – the revival of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a center that many I.V. residents thought would never exist.

Thomas Anderle, according to Unander, who advised the plaintiffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander, who has been with the Legal Resource Center since 2003, said that across the 18 cases, the total amount sought from the management company was $24,215. Of that, the plaintiffs received $13,785 back in money initially put into security deposits and $1,200 in “bad faith” charges — meaning the plaintiffs proved the management company had acted in violation of an agreement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander emphasized that from her perspective, the owners of Isla Vista Luxury Living hadn’t acted in a malicious manner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they just “clearly didn’t have a handle on the law the way they thought they did,” and that these cases were “a real education for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this landlord learned a lot in the three days we were in court,” she said. “They didn’t consider that they were abusing the tenants’ deposits. They really felt they were entitled to take what they took.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 12 properties listed on the Isla Vista Luxury Living website: 760 Embarcadero Del Norte, 6656 Picasso, 6659 Abrego , 6599 Madrid, 6565 Segovia, 6629 Sabado Tarde, 910 Camino Pescadero, 897 Camino Del Sur, 6578 Trigo, 6510 Sabado Tarde, 6508 Seville and 6517 El Greco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Luxury Living was created in July 2018, according to California business records. Its owners are Bijan Moshayedi and his father, Mike, who currently resides in Newport Beach; according to Unander and several of the tenants who spoke to the Nexus, a man named Keenan Duran serves as the properties’ manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, it was during Spring Quarter 2019 and the beginning of summer that the Isla Vista Tenants Union saw an uptick in the number of people coming in. While the union typically sees an increase when leases end, she noticed that a large number of people were complaining about the same landlord: Isla Vista Luxury Living. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tenant, Tyler Wells, created a Facebook group to help keep track of all the complaints; as of Thursday, the group has 92 members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past several months, tenants have posted complaints and concerns about I.V. Luxury Living to the group, including duplicate charges, not receiving receipts for work done, charges for what they believed to be normal wear and tear, alleged excess charges for painting and carpet cleaning, among others </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one plaintiff posted about a $120 billing charge he received for a broken toilet paper holder, and another said they were charged $45 to replace a lightbulb. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One plaintiff and member of the Facebook group, Natalie Mazmanian in the case of Mazmanian v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, told the Nexus that, among other charges she later disputed, she had been charged for a water filter in her apartment at 760 Embarcadero Del Norte </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a water filter that had never existed in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was more the principles than it was money, honestly,” Mazmanian told the Nexus. “It was a year [under their] management, and all we ever did was have problems … [Duran] had no sort of management skills coming into this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mazmanian was also charged $559 for a cleaning fee, $90 to replace two lights in the living room and for water damage for kitchen cabinets </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water damage, she said, that was caused by the absence of a water filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis’ first property was acquired when Bijan was a student at UC Santa Barbara in 2009. Bijan’s name is attached to at least nine properties in the Santa Barbara area, according to Santa Barbara clerk recorder records. Mike’s is attached to at least one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada confirmed that someone with the name Bijan Moshayedi attended UCSB between Fall Quarter 2007 and Summer 2011. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bijan Moshayedi and Duran did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis created Isla Vista Luxury Living after splitting from its former management company, Meridian Group Real Estate, during the summer of 2018.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deedy Hedrick, a property supervisor for Meridian who managed the Moshayedis’ properties from 2014 to summer 2018, also testified in support of some of the plaintiffs, according to Unander. Hedrick testified in one case that the amount the plaintiffs were charged for cleaning was double than what was typically charged for “extra heavy cleaning,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the eight cases that went to trial, all received money back, although the amounts awarded varied. But in two cases </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living and McBride et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Anderle found that the management company had acted in bad faith and awarded the plaintiffs the full security deposits plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Court spent hours on this case trying to ferret out what and why the events occurred,” Judge Anderle wrote in his decision in Pena v. Isla Vista Luxury Living. He stated that the management company had “vastly overcharged in this case” and that the plaintiffs did “everything that could be expected of tenants.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Plaintiffs] did a thorough job of documenting the move-in and move-out. On the other hand the Luxury Living documentation was cursory at best and irresponsible at worst,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena, a Santa Barbara City College student who asked to be referred to only by her last name, explained that when she and her partner first moved into their apartment at 6565 Segovia, it was managed by Meridian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once Isla Vista Luxury Living took over, she said the manager, Duran repeatedly ignored her requests for routine maintenance, even one request for him to fix the “staples or nails” coming out of the carpet. When it did come time to move out, the company did not return any of her deposit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she and her partner “took pictures of everything” and “had every [communication with Duran] in text,” which she said is likely why she was awarded the full security deposit plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In McBride v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, Judge Anderle awarded the plaintiffs their full security deposit back, as well as an additional $314, in part because Duran had “told the plaintiffs there were ‘no problems’ … leading them to conclude they would get their security deposit back.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judge added that there was nothing in the move-out report “that reflects any viable issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelsey McBride, a class of 2019 graduate, told the Nexus that when she moved out of her apartment, her and her roommates “cleaned for two days,” adding that “it was in better condition that when we moved in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after they moved out, even though Duran had told McBride </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with her mother as a witness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that her whole security deposit would be returned, they only received three quarters of what they had been told. They were also charged hundreds of dollars for carpet cleaning and painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did nothing wrong,” McBride said. “They owed us money. We took action to get that money rightfully returned to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of money settled by plaintiffs out of court was not ava</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ilable. Of the cases that went to trial, besides Pena’s and McBride’s, Judge Anderle awarded nearly all of them about half of what they sued for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the plaintiffs who talked to the Nexus stated they had only ever dealt with Duran and not the owners directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander hopes other Isla Vistans will see these cases and “stand up and do something” if their landlord is mistreating them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Landlords have become accustomed to the students basically complaining about things, but then doing nothing. The fact that we were able to coordinate 18 different units … that’s huge.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
