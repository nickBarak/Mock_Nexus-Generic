Santa Barbara has rediscovered its form just in time for its last match before the Big West Tournament, bouncing back to beat UC Riverside after back-to-back losses against conference opponents Long Beach State and UC Irvine. Saturday’s match will also honor the Gauchos’ graduating seniors Stacy Yam and April Scatliffe.</p>\n<p>UCSB is part of a three-way tie for second in the Big West with UC Irvine and Northridge. A win on Saturday could potentially seal a second place conference finish for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ freshman Molly Reed has the school’s best singles record at 9-6, playing mostly on the No. 3 court. For the Gauchos, freshman Natalie Da Silveira has been most consistent during the singles competition, boasting an overall record of 15-6 while playing mostly in the No. 2 position.</p>\n<p>Freshman Lou Adler most recently returned to action in the Gauchos’ win against UC Riverside, getting the win on the No. 3 court alongside Da Silveira. Adler was out for eight weeks with a stress fracture on her right foot at the start of the season and has returned to the Gauchos side just in time for the Big West Tournament. Before she was injured, Adler won all three of her singles matches against UNLV, Arkansas and Saint Mary’s, earning a No. 93 national ranking in the process.</p>\n<p>In Cal Poly’s most recent match against No. 72 CSUM, the Mustangs lost 4-3 in a closely contested match, showing that they will be a tough battle for the Gauchos on Saturday, despite their record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Cal Poly at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday morning at the Rob Gym tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/gauchos-welcome-cal-poly-before-conference-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/gauchos-welcome-cal-poly-before-conference-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/gauchos-welcome-cal-poly-before-conference-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/gauchos-welcome-cal-poly-before-conference-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/gauchos-welcome-cal-poly-before-conference-tourney/","id":981,"author":{"id":287,"name":"Evander Hilton"},"related":[980,979,978],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":287,"name":"Evander Hilton","biography":"Not available","articles":[123,126,128,133,135,138,143,149,154,157,158,159,162,164,952,956,981,983,2036],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Defeats Pacific, Drops Two Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The doubles point was all-important in the Gauchos last three matches","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62312\" style=\"width: 2787px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"982205452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62312\" data-attachment-id=\"62312\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/2-1-15christinademarzomenstennis15-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg?fit=2777%2C4166&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2777,4166\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays hits the ball across the net to his opponent.

The Gaucho pair of seniors Tobias Galskov and Ziad Sultan was defeated 6-2 while the duo of junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson fell 6-4. The Aggies took a 1-0 lead, meaning the Gauchos would need four singles victories to claim the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly tied the match with a one-sided win from sophomore Morgan Mays, playing on court three. Mays took his eighth singles victory in a row, winning in straight sets of 6-2, 6-0 to put UCSB on the board 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was the next to finish and his win gave his team a 2-1 advantage in the match. Rakela defeated his opponent on court four in straight sets of 6-4, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were in need of two more singles victories to take the conference match, but fell just short, as only sophomore Teague Hamilton was able to add a win for Santa Barbara. Galskov, coming off of injury was unable to find his rhythm on court one and was defeated in straight sets. Hamilton battled through three sets and won 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 on the sixth court, but it was not enough as the Aggies took the slim victory 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a better start Sunday morning at UOP as Mays and his partner junior Andrew Riminton took a 6-2 win on court three to begin doubles play. The Tigers tied it up on court one and the doubles point came down to Eshmade and Johnsson on court two. In a tie break, the Gaucho duo took a 7-6 win to put their team up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Pacific split the singles matchups 3-3 to give Santa Barbara a 4-3 win – just the team’s third on the road this season. The three wins from the Gaucho side came from the same three in the earlier match with Davis.</p>\n<p>Hamilton added his second straight win of the road trip with his straight set victory on the sixth court. He was the first to finish, winning 6-5, 6-2 and put his team up 2-0. Mays followed just after with his 6-3, 6-4 victory. This win extended his singles match streak to nine straight wins and moved him back up to the second spot on the roster.</p>\n<p>Rakela was the one to seal the match for the Gauchos with his hard fought victory on court one. The freshman took the first set 6-4 before being bested in the second 3-6. In the third and final set, Rakela blew by his opponent 6-1 to ensure the Gauchos a victory on this long trip.</p>\n<p>The final match of this road trip was all too familiar at this point in the weekend for UCSB. Once again the Gauchos found themselves in a match decided by one point, and fell 4-3 to a hot Fresno State team. The Bulldogs capitalized on the doubles point and UCSB split the singles matches for the third straight time.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough loss,” Mays said. “But they were a very tough team. It goes to show you how important the doubles point is.”</p>\n<p>Eshmade, who struggled in the two matches prior, finally found his feet while playing away and grabbed a win on the number one court. He took a one-sided victory in straight sets of 6-1, 6-2 to give his team some hope for the overall win.</p>\n<p>Down 3-1 in the match, both Johnsson and Hamilton added wins to the UCSB scoreboard to tie it at 3-3. They both won in straight sets as well going 6-2, 6-1, and 6-3, 6-4, respectively.</p>\n<p>The match came down to the number four court where Rakela found himself down 1-0 and already losing the second set. The freshman battled back to force a tie breaker in the second but was edged out 6-7 to give the Bulldogs the home victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last part of the season so this is what matters now,” Mays said. “We just need to step up. We are all really pumped for Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home this Saturday to renew the Blue-Green Rivalry against a tough No. 49 Cal Poly team. The Gauchos, who currently stand at 8-0 at home, will be looking to become the first team in school history to post an undefeated home season. The action is set to start at 2 pm at the Rec Cen courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/","id":978,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[977,976,975],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warriors Vs.

Iguodala provides defensive versatility to the Warriors starting five, which allows them to throw different looks at LeBron James throughout the series, which could give him problems. However, Iguodala’s veteran leadership might be the most important thing he adds to Golden State.</p>\n<p>He acts like a second coach on the floor by instructing players on where to go and calming everyone down when they start getting too loose with the ball. The versatility he provides is also apparent on offense, where he can play a point-forward role with the second unit or the starters, allowing the numerous great shooters on their squad to run off screens and find their shot. Iguodala has been ruled out for Game 1 and he will be reevaluated before Game 2, so the Warriors will have to make it work with Kevon Looney or Jordan Bell in his place for now. But if he is able to get back on the floor, even if he isn’t fully healthy, his effect on his team cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>KEVIN LOVE: </strong></p>\n<p>It’s weird to say that an All-Star can be considered an X-Factor to his team, but Kevin Love has been up-and-down throughout the playoffs and he was injured for basically each of the last two games the Cavs played against Boston. Love is still in concussion protocol and his status for Game 1 is uncertain, but if he can get back on the floor and contribute, that opens up a lot of opportunities for his team.</p>\n<p>His best performances in the playoffs came against the Raptors, where he averaged 20.5 points for the series and was clearly playing his most confident basketball. More importantly, when Love was an offensive threat that commanded attention, the other role players on Cleveland were able to find their groove and start producing. If Love can channel his play from the Raptors series and stay healthy, he will take some of the load off of LeBron, and the Cavs might just be able to catch the Warriors off guard and give them a challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sizing Up Each Squad’s Starting Line-Up</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bishop</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors feature impressive depth amongst their bench players, this upcoming NBA Finals matchup will be centered around both teams’ formidable starting lineups. Of the 10 players who will be on the court when the Finals kicks off this Wednesday, six made appearances in this year’s all-star game, with the Cavaliers’ LeBron James and the Warriors’ Stephen Curry serving as captains of the East and West all-star teams respectively. While this will be the fourth consecutive finals meeting for the Warriors and the Cavs, the position matchups have changed significantly since last season. Let’s break down each of the starting lineups and who they will be facing this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POINT GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Filling out the point guard position for the Cavs will be seasoned veteran George Hill, who is renowned for his three-point shooting abilities. Hill’s shot has fallen off slightly since the start of the postseason, and he will likely have a tough time competing with the Warriors’ Stephen Curry, one of the league’s most heralded point guards and three-point shooters. Curry’s ability to quickly come off screens and drain deep shots will likely put Hill in a tough spot throughout the series, and his PPG average throughout the postseason (24.8) dwarfs Hill’s (9.7).</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHOOTING GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The two guard position will likely favor the Warriors as well, with all-star Klay Thompson facing the Cavs’ veteran J.R. Smith. Like Hill, Smith makes his living behind the arc, leaving more room for LeBron James to do his thing. Smith has shot 36.8 percent on three point attempts this season, and he is known to catch fire when it counts, hitting multiple shots that helped the Cavs capture a Finals victory in 2016. However, Smith will be forced to contend with Klay Thompson, who has been hot this postseason, notching 20.5 PPG and shooting 42.6 percent from three. Thompson is one of the purest shooters in the league, and the Warriors’ offensive system will likely get him multiple open looks, regardless of how hard J.R. plays up on him. While Thompson has a tendency to fall off in big games, if he’s left open, he’s practically automatic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SMALL FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The small forward matchup will be the one to watch throughout the series. The Warriors will ante up with their star player, Kevin Durant, who has dominated the playoffs with his precise shooting, notching 29.0 [[ok]] PPG. Durant has proved to be a challenge to opponents on both sides of the ball, but he is slightly outmatched by his counterpart on the Cavaliers. LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time, and while Kevin Durant can sometimes hang with him, there is no way to completely shut him down. LeBron almost single-handedly carried the Cavs throughout the postseason, averaging an astonishing 34.0 PPG, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. LeBron does it all, and if teams attempt to double him, he has other shooters on the perimeter to back him up. He is a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly has the upper hand in this matchup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POWER FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both teams feature small forwards at the four position, with the Warriors starting Kevon Looney, and the Cavs starting Jeff Green in place of the injured Kevin Love. Looney has not done a whole lot during the playoffs, with about 4.5 PPG and 4.9 rebounds, and is mostly just filling in due to injuries. He will likely be outmatched by Green, whose point production helped LeBron get an edge over the Boston Celtics in the last two games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Green has averaged only about 8.3 PPG this postseason, but if he can turn it up during the Finals, he could prove to be even more of an asset to Cleveland.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CENTER: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Golden State and Cleveland fill their five spots with power forwards, operating under more of a “small ball” system. Cleveland’s Tristan Thompson has not lived up to his extensive salary, especially during the playoffs, with a quiet 6.1 PPG and 6.1 rebounds. He will face off against the Warriors’ all-star, Draymond Green, who has been nothing short of studly when it comes to crashing boards, notching 11.6 rebounds per game. Green averages about 11.1 PPG, and while his three point shot has fallen off since the Warriors’ last finals appearance, he is still deadly from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the May 31</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83429\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83429\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/","id":979,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[978,977,976],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Men’s Tennis Looks To Make History at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One more win and the Gauchos will accomplish something that no team in the program's history has before","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62440\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"787300488\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62435\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62440\" data-attachment-id=\"62440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/andrew-riminton-and-morgan-mays-stand-ready-to-play-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_10-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.2\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Andrew Riminton and Morgan Mays stand ready to play.

With an outstanding home record of 8-0, this year’s team has the chance to go undefeated at home for the first time.</p>\n<p>After a shaky road trip, a win over the Mustangs could give the Gauchos the momentum they need heading to the Big West Conference Tournament next week.</p>\n<p>It would also be the perfect way to send off team captains, seniors Ziad Sultan and Tobias Galskov, who will be playing in their final match in Santa Barbara. With the two long-time Gauchos making their last home stand, Saturday’s match will also play host to the Senior Day celebration.</p>\n<p>UCSB has found its success in its depth as a team and each player’s ability to adapt to whatever challenges that Head Coach Marty Davis presents to them. Whether it is hopping into the doubles lineup with a new partner, or going from playing the number three court to the number one court, these Gauchos have handled all adversity with poise and success.</p>\n<p>Junior Nathan Eshmade has played as low as four on the order of the courts this season, and due to a recent hot streak, the junior has been bumped up to the number one court and has brought his team victory despite the big jump.</p>\n<p>Mays, who just got off of a nine-match singles win streak, has played around the top of the lineup all year. The depth and adaptability has helped this team progress in that each player can rely on every teammate to do his job despite the workload.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been hot in this latter part of the season having won eight of their last eleven matches. They even found their rhythm on the road going 3-3 in that last stretch, after starting off the season 0-6. UCSB is playing its best tennis of the season at the perfect time with the postseason just around the corner, but Cal Poly could very well put a damper on it, as it is not a team to take lightly.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are in position to take first place in the Big West conference standings and currently lead the other Big West teams in ranking as they sit at No. 49 nationally. They recently held a five-match win streak before falling 5-2 to the current Big West leader, UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match in Santa Barbara will be the Mustangs’ last regular season match of the year as well, and they will be looking to spoil the show for the Gauchos and reach a higher seeding for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The blue-green rivalry will be renewed this Saturday at 3:00 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/","id":980,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[979,978,977],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
