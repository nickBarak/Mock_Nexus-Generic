UTRGV comes into this weekend series boasting a strong 16-13 overall record along with a 3-3 conference mark but has lost its last three games all by at least five runs and a combined 25 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This weekend will mark the first time these two programs meet in school history, and, as such, it is an important one for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Having lost to USC 9-3 on Tuesday, the Gauchos failed to capitalize on the chance of getting to .500 for the first time this season and to continue the momentum it had gained from taking two of three against perennial Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Despite this being the first time UCSB will take on UTRGV, it is no strangers to opponents from the WAC conference — the conference UTRGV belongs to.</p>\n<p>In the Checketts’ era, Santa Barbara has posted a 13-11 mark against Western Athletic Conference opponents with all of those games being against either Sac State, who it dropped two of three to earlier this year, or Cal State Bakersfield who it has yet to play this season. Against Texas schools in general during the Checketts’ era, UCSB has gone 8-15.</p>\n<p>“Honestly all the Texas teams we have played so far have been really talented so we are going to treat these guys like any other team and come out ready to play,” Lincoln said. “We are definitely confident. We know we have the talent to compete with anybody if we do all the things we know we can do.”</p>\n<p>This series is also important because it marks the end of the six-series, 21 of 22 game homestand the Gauchos were enjoying in the middle to latter part of its season. A series win against a quality opponent would be huge.</p>\n<p>UCSB has won its last two weekend series and a big part of that has been the pitching as it has only allowed an average of 2.5 runs per game in its last six weekend matches.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it starts with pitching and we have had some solid performances on the mound from guys like Ledesma who was great last week,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Being the Sunday starter, Stevie Ledesma has been nothing short of spectacular in his first three starts this season. In those games, the senior has tallied a 0.96 ERA and delivered a beauty in his win against CSUF last Sunday going 7.2 innings allowing just four hits, one earned run while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Chris Lincoln has also been nothing short of solid these last few weeks recording a 2.70 ERA as a starter. He currently sports a 2.15 ERA on the year overall and has also recorded a career-high 27 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“This is still a learning experience for me and I know I still have a lot to learn but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far,” Lincoln said. “It’s been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season and it’s paid off.”</p>\n<p>In his career, the sophomore has made six career starts but has yet to pick up a win. His lone victory of his career came in relief work. In three starts so far this season, Lincoln has earned a no decision in each outing but the ‘Chos have won each match.</p>\n<p>“So far this year all of my starts have been team wins and I am happy with that and I know if I keep working the win will come, but yeah absolutely I’d like to get my first [win],” Lincoln said.</p>\n<p>With former bullpen pitchers now becoming starts, UCSB has needed other guys to fill those roles and sophomore Shea Barry and freshman Chris Troye has done just that.</p>\n<p>“Shea Barry has been great out of the pen and Chris Troye looks like he is getting healthier and consistent so that’s a boost,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>This season, Barry has a 2-0 record and one save with a 3.09 ERA and 12 K’s while Troye, who struggled earlier this year, has allowed zero runs in his last two outings in relief.</p>\n<p>One thing the Gauchos do have to worry about is replacing stud freshman Andrew Martinez to an injury. This year he has become a defensive star and had a .319 batting average with four homers.</p>\n<p>“Losing Martinez is tough but [Marcus] Castanon has done a great job filling in at shortstop but now we need to fill our second base spot so really that is key for us going forward,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Overall this weekend could be a real turning point for the Gauchos but it needs to take advantage something it hasn’t done the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>“We would like to finally be above .500 by the end of this weekend, it will be tough but it would be nice to have that momentum going forward,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UTRGV for game one at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 6 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Not only are the Gauchos a league-best 5-1, but they also possess a 27-5 overall record, the best winning percentage in the nation (.844),  and are currently on a nine-game winning streak — that’s only their second best run this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to continue this hot streak it has going when it welcomes UC Davis into town this weekend. The Aggies are currently 11-18 overall and are tied for seventh in the Big West with a 3-6 conference mark.</p>\n<p>All season long, Santa Barbara has produced efficient play, both at the plate and on the field. Last weekend’s sweep of UCI, however, proved that this UCSB team is not a fluke, they are for real.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In that series, the Gauchos pitching staff held the Anteaters to just an average of five hits and one run per game. Coming into that series, Irvine had averaged eight hits per game and nearly seven runs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB totaled 28 hits and 17 runs during the series. Irvine had given up an average of seven hits and just 3.5 runs per game before the three-game set.</p>\n<p>Point is, UCSB proved a lot last weekend, and, despite UC Davis posing less of a threat, there is no doubt this team is still gearing to prove everybody wrong.</p>\n<p>Sitting at first place in the Big West, the Gauchos are currently in prime position to claim its first Big West title since 1986.</p>\n<p>A big reason for that is the renewed offensive output, specifically, power hitting. The Gauchos have already surpassed their home run total of 2018 (34), with 38 thus far with 22 games still remaining.</p>\n<p>This season, UCSB is 22-1 when hitting at least one home run in a game. It is 5-4 when it fails to do so.</p>\n<p>Even beyond the long ball, Santa Barbara leads the entire country in triples with 21. Outfielders Armani Smith and Tommy Jew keep jockeying for the team lead in triples with the former having six and latter having five. Smith is ranks second in the country while Jew ranks ninth.</p>\n<p>Funny enough, Smith and Jew are also tied for the most home runs on the team with each having eight a piece.</p>\n<p>Junior catcher Eric Yang is also continuing his great season. Yang leads UCSB with a .393 batting average which also ranks 43 in the country. His 34 RBI’s are also a team high.</p>\n<p>The catcher has also been a beast behind the plate, boasting a .996 fielding percentage and he has thrown out 50% of base runners attempting to steal.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pitching staff has also been nothing short of great. The staff currently ranks eighth in WHIP (1.13) and 13th in ERA (3.20) in the country.</p>\n<p>Friday starter Ben Brecht has been awesome this season. Brecht leads the Big West and ranks fourth in the nation with seven wins and boasts a 2.75 ERA. His 69 strikeouts are also the best in the league.</p>\n<p>Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln has also been a reliable arm out the pen, especially in the clutch, as his eight saves are tied for the league high. Freshman pitcher Michael McGreevy, the usual first pitcher out of the pen for the ‘Chos, currently possesses the best ERA in the league with a 1.57.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are led by sophomore infielder Tanner Murray at the plate, who leads the team with a .427 BA with one home run and 14 RBIs. He earned a Big West Field Player of the Week honor earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The pitching staff is led by Friday starter Brett Erwin who is 3-3 with a 2.79 ERA. As a team, the Aggies hit .280 and have a team ERA of 5.76.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB has proven how good it is this season, especially at home where the team is 17-1. Now, Santa Barbara can’t afford to take its foot off the pedal. It has to continue the pace it is playing at, lock up a Big West title, and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s second ever host for a regional or even its first host for a Super Regional.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin its series against UC Davis at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 18 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two will commence at 3 p.m. on Friday while game three will start at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the same location.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.  of the April 18, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They had a garage,” Gerstenberger said. “And the second that I had space was, ‘let’s go buy a piece of equipment and make it happen.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gertsenberger also touched on his eagerness to begin screen-printing, which he said he was drawn to from the beginning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that I could actually see the process of creating a stencil on a mesh with ink and a squeegee and create a final product is, I think, really fascinating.” Ultimately, he said, he “just wanted to have a print shop in a garage just so [he] could make [his] own t-shirts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Gerstenberger built his passion project into a small business, starting with $7,000 in investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “$7,000 is a lot in some mindsets,” he said. But, assuming one order of t-shirts was worth $500, “I could do … 10 jobs or 20 jobs in two years and make my money back.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon enough, he had far more than 20 jobs coming his way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerstenberger recalled working 40 to 50 hours a week at the beginning, which, according to his calculations, was often far less than minimum wage. But the business kept growing, necessitating five moves across Goleta and Santa Barbara in search of bigger spaces to keep up with demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At times, I hoped that there was an electrical fire that happened where we could just be like, ‘bummer, it all burned down and we got to move on,’” he joked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as the company grew, something had to give; in this case, it was Gerstenberger’s economics major, which he dropped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s ironic, because I walked into the econ department saying I’m gonna start a small business … ‘Do you guys have any suggestions?’” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department advised that he “apply the theories” that he learned in his classes. Later, when Gerstenberger returned at wits’ end to ask if he could use his business as the basis of a research project, which would have allowed him to reduce his course load, they turned him down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[They were] like, ‘sorry, we can’t do anything,’” Gerstenberger said. “‘We can’t do independent study,’ like, ‘this is the way it is.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these hardships, Gerstenberger said he lives for what he does.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve learned to realize that the people around me are the most valuable thing I have,” he said, listing customers that range from  PTA moms, to “a random group of people from elementary school” to “a small business here to a medium-sized business there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone needs t-shirts,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular relationship that stuck with Gerstenberger is Jose Cardoso, a fellow screen printer with over 25 years of experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We met when I was in the garage and I didn’t have the experience that I needed to do everything,” Gerstenberger said. “And so I’d send him jobs that I couldn’t do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gerstenberger, the pair quickly settled into their own roles: he the “designer and sales,” and Cardoso the “master printer.” After a year of working together, they decided to join forces for good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trust in other people and … let other people do the things that aren’t your strengths,” Gerstenberger said. “Divide and conquer was something that was important for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Gerstenberger said he is looking to expand operations to universities beyond UCSB and to parts of northern California. More recently, in 2018, Island View Outfitters moved their print shop to Cuyama, a town two hours away from I.V. with “a market, a gas station and a hotel,” and little else, but with cheaper manufacturing costs and the ability to ship to anywhere in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The future is never certain, and the difficulty with a small business is we don’t have that control,” he added. “On the other side though, it’s not a matter about what the future is. It’s a matter about today, it’s a matter about the present.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/","id":4105,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[4104,4103,4102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Roughed Up in 10-2 Loss at UC Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-23-MensBaseballUSC-EricSwensonNexus-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the loss, Santa Barbara falls to 15-14-1 on the season and 2-2 in Big West play.

After getting an out in the inning, Dashwood gave up a single to freshman Brendan Brooks bringing another run to the plate and earning UCI the 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>RBI and home-run leading senior Ryan Fitzpatrick stepped up to the plate and cleared the bases with a left-center shot that put the Eaters up 5-1 at the end of three innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ starter could not stop the bleeding and the UCI batters would pile on to their lead in the subsequent inning.</p>\n<p>The pair of Christian Koss and Matt Reitano would strike again in the bottom of the fourth inning when the pair earned their second RBI and run of the game respectively.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Konnor Zickefoose would also make his second trip around the bags and at the end of four, the Anteaters were ahead 7-1. The Zickefoose run would end Dashwood’s night at 3.1 innings pitched with seven earned runs.</p>\n<p>Clay Fisher would score the Gauchos’ final run of the game in the top of the eighth, but UCI simply added onto their lead even more in the bottom of the same inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Cole Kreuter hit a home run to start off the inning while sophomore Ryan Johnston and Ryan Fitzpatrick would each hit singles to bring home runners of their own. UC Irvine would end the first game of the series, victorious by eight at 10-2.</p>\n<p>It was a tale of two different pitchers as UCI’s starter Andre Pallante went the distance, giving up the lone earned run in the third over seven innings pitched. Pallante was able to keep the Gaucho bats silent before forcing his team to go to the bullpen to pull him.</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had a great month of April so far with 15 innings pitched, one earned run, and two wins over his two appearances. Much like the Dirtbags on his April 6 start, the Gauchos were similarly stifled and failed to get any significant offensive rhythm.</p>\n<p>Dashwood had an unexpectedly mediocre outing and is now the possessor of a less than exciting 2-5 record.</p>\n<p>The freshman had been on a recent wave of success before his start against UCI, going at least five innings pitched with one earned run or less in each of his past three starts.</p>\n<p>However, the 18.90 ERA posted for today’s game is Dashwood’s worst start of the season. No matter the lefty can certainly move along in the season with the assurance of seemingly nowhere to go but up.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue the series against the Anteaters on Saturday, April 14 at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/","id":4106,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4105,4104,4103],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
