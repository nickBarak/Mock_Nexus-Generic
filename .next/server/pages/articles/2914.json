Many people were probably conceived [in Isla Vista], but I was born there.”</p>\n<p>Faber then moved to Sacramento with his older brother and younger sister three years later, growing up in northern California with his two siblings and wrestling for UC Davis. After graduating, Faber made his professional MMA debut in 2003 with the Gladiator Challenge promotion.</p>\n<p>In 2006, the I.V. native began fighting for the World Extreme Cagefighting Organization, defeating Cole Escovedo by technical knock-out. He held the WEC Featherweight title for over two years, defending the belt from five challengers over that span.</p>\n<p>Faber lost the title to Mike Brown via TKO at WEC 36 in 2006. In a rematch that would become one of the most memorable fights in MMA history, Faber broke his right hand in an early round and later broke his left thumb. The injuries forced him to resort to using only elbows and kicks. He lost the bout.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the first round I was like, ‘dude my hand is shattered,’” Faber said. “I went back to the corner and told my instructor. He told me to shut up. I wanted to tell someone. My right hand is my biggest weapon. With a little bluffing and creativity I got past the second round. Desperation was setting in, and then a third-round uppercut dislocated my thumb.”</p>\n<p>Faber worked hard to get back on top until he finally earned a shot to fight Brazilian Jose Aldo for the WEC Featherweight Championship on April 24, 2010. But Faber couldn’t handle the vicious kicks of Aldo, and he went on to lose in a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p>In October of 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and all WEC fighters were absorbed by the UFC. The merge gives the I.V. native a shot to shine in the national spotlight.</p>\n<p>“Bigger pay days and more sponsorships,” Faber said of fighting for the UFC. “But the biggest thing is getting the credit we deserve. Because the UFC does such a good job branding, WEC fighters don’t get the recognition. The WEC was a high concentration of incredibly exciting fights. It will be cool to guarantee an exciting show for fans.”</p>\n<p>Now an MMA superstar in the UFC, The California Kid never forgets his roots.</p>\n<p>“A good portion of my family still lives in Santa Barbara,” Faber said. “My grandma lives on Mission Street. I spend a lot of time in SB. I actually celebrated my 21st birthday in Isla Vista. All my buddies road tripped to I.V., but I only remember about half the night. They were pushing me in a shopping cart and doorbell-ditching houses.”</p>\n<p>Faber will debut in the UFC on March 19th at UFC 128 as he takes on Eddie Wineland, the former WEC Bantamweight Champion.

I understand we are a beach college but a lot of Greeks are the most intimidated by the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>Escobar-Henry said publicly admitting your sexual orientation as gay can lead to negativity from those who oppose the gay community.</p>\n<p>“I feel that ‘coming out’ is definitely a gateway to have hatred towards you,” Escobar-Henry said. “The hatred comes from ignorance and making jokes out of LGBTQ people in the media and public.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English and film &amp; media studies major Chloe Babauta also spoke on the panel and said because of her bisexual identity she has been followed and verbally assaulted in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One time, I was walking down the street in Isla Vista with a girl,” Babauta said. “I was holding her hand and was followed. Another time, I was with my lesbian friends and men tried to make me make-out with them. I felt threatened and in danger.

The department was recently ranked number one in the country by the online database College Factual ranking last month.</p>\n<p>Sociology Department chair and professor Maria Charles said the conference is aimed at celebrating the milestone while also reflecting upon the department’s work in the field.</p>\n<p>“Our Ph.D. program was founded in the 1964-65 academic year, so one reason is to celebrate the major milestone, and the other reason is to consider UCSB’s Department of Sociology’s intellectual contributions, particularly looking at fields in which we have had [an] intellectual role in over the years,” Charles said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s program, topics that will be presented include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, globalization, ethnography, conversation analysis and social movements. Charles said she is excited to see the presentations on issues that have significant implications for society.</p>\n<p>“The speakers will be reflecting on the development of certain sociological subfields over the past 50 years,” Charles said. “We’re also looking at the impact of the department in terms of contributions to broader social good, because our faculty is very interested in doing research that is socially relevant and that address important social problems of today.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, 10 former department chairs will be attending the event in addition to current sociology professors. Sociology graduate student Corrie Ellis said she decided to help coordinate the event and bring back former faculty for the opportunity to meet past faculty and department chairs and reflect on the history of the department.</p>\n<p>“I really got to know and interview some of the sociology faculty that has made UCSB sociology what it is today,” Ellis said. “It’s a special opportunity for all of us and especially graduate students to learn about the history of UCSB sociology, which I think is a very radical history and I’m very proud to be part of it.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, after talking to former faculty and chairs, she and another graduate student developed a timeline of faculty and chairs that will be displayed at the conference.</p>\n<p>UCLA sociology professor Steven Clayman, who received his Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology, said he is excited for the graduate program and looks forward to commemorating his alma mater.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to have come from that world-class program and it’s really great that they are now reaching their 50th anniversary,” Clayman said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/","id":2912,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2911,2910,2909],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate members listen intently during their weekly meeting in the Flying A room. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss resolutions on former Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young’s retirement celebration, Gaucho Health Insurance and the campus climate survey.</p>\n<p>After receiving the resolution to celebrate Young’s 25 years as vice chancellor, Young attended Senate and said he was confident in the student body to continue a legacy of upstanding community members.</p>\n<p>“You students, your current generation and those that preceded you have always had a sense of community, had a sense of something bigger and more important than they are, have really always been in my mind on the right side of history,” Young said.  “Students have always been on the right side of history because you think beyond what is the present.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy spoke about a recent Alumni Association meeting in which the possible restructuring of the Division of Student Affairs by moving the location of Career Services to the Alumni Association was discussed.</p>\n<p>“I have to share publicly that I am very opposed to that structural relocation of Career Services,” Guthy said. “Although they were having a preliminary discussion on the idea, I want you to be aware though those discussions are being had.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, she will be meeting with a committee to explore the restructuring further, although no decisions have been made about moving forward with the proposal. Guthy said the move would not solve any existing problems because there is a lack of alumni staff dedicated to Career Services.</p>\n<p>“I am not saying that they couldn’t develop that [staff] over time, but right now they have absolutely no career service,” Guthy said, “I think that it should be controlled by a Department that for years has been focused on undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Vice President Angela Lau updated the Senate on last week’s news that the Student Health Board was considering lowering financial aid given to students not enrolled in the Gaucho Health Insurance plan. Lau said a compromise has been reached that will offer financial aid to students enrolled in a private plan equal to the average insurance costs for students insured outside the university plan.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a standard that takes the average of how much students usually pay for health insurance and that’s how much will be applied towards financial aid, instead of getting like nothing,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also discussed the campus climate survey and said three campus goals regarding increased student services is in progress.</p>\n<p>“The three goals that the University has identified as the most important from that survey were working to create better services for LGBTQ identified students and underrepresented minorities on campus, sexual assault prevention and the aftermath and staff morale,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s meeting, senators also approved a resolution directing the A.S. Ticket Office to undergo the i&gt;clicker rental program, sent the 24 hour café resolution to committee, discussed greener alternatives to blue test booklets and passed the A.S. Legal Code update.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thurday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/","id":2913,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2912,2911,2910],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
