Really beginning to ask myself what I felt and why it was I felt that way helped clarify my emotions, and being able to give a reason to those clarified emotions gave me comfort and acceptance. If you’re able to feel comfortable with and accept your own feelings, that often alleviates some of the stress of expressing those emotions to someone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not comfortable being alone naked in a room with someone, you probably shouldn’t be having sex.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the stress that contributes to being honest with someone is the idea of vulnerability. Particularly in physical relationships,  there are many ways to be vulnerable to your partner and if an open, accepting environment hasn’t been established, expressing your honest opinion could very well be one of those ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as we hate to admit it, vulnerability will inevitably play a role in every sexual relationship we have, the first reason being that we’re naked. Unless you have been gifted with the shamelessness of a baby, being naked is a very vulnerable experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the seventh grade, my health teacher prefaced his sex talk with “If you’re not comfortable being alone naked in a room with someone, you probably shouldn’t be having sex.” At that point in my life, I wasn’t even comfortable being naked in a room by myself. Point being: we are all vulnerable from time to time, and acknowledging and accepting that vulnerability could do us wonders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to sexual vulnerability, whether it be with a new partner or with someone you’ve been with for years, there is often a pressing concern about whether or not what you’re doing is making your partner feel good, or whether or not you will be able to make them orgasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to be clear, no, sex is not like it appears in the movies. You will not always know your partner’s body,  and while WikiHow may be able to generally describe to you in bullet points “How to Give a Blow Job” or “What Makes a Girl Cum,” I can guarantee that no article would be able to tell you better than your partner would. Surprise, people masturbate and know their bodies! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something feels good, tell your partner, because chances are, they’re wondering just like you are and the affirmation could even add to the moment. It doesn’t have to be some elaborate PowerPoint about the logistics of your G-spot or a graph representing the sensitivity of your tip, but a simple “Don’t stop” could do the trick. Plus, what’s sexier than being able to trust and communicate with your partner?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being honest also means that when something doesn’t feel good, you express that too. When your partner asks “Does that feel good?” and you respond “Uhhh, yeah…” then neither of you are is getting anything out of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reinforcing the idea that what they’re doing feels good while you are either in pain or feeling nothing and your partner is completely misled. How are they supposed to know? And yes, there are the “obvious” physical reactions we have to sexual stimulation, but being told something doesn’t feel good will have a more “productive outcome” than someone trying to guess whether or not their partner is wet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes dicks just aren’t meant to bend the way you want them to bend and that’s something honesty has taught me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being completely honest, sex is so much better when you’re actually genuinely enjoying yourself and not worrying about whether or not you’re making your partner feel good. If your partner tells you and shows you how to make them feel good, you can probably assume with a higher degree of certainty that you’re making them feel pretty damn good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are many more aspects to physical relationships, honesty gives you the freedom, power and peace of mind to enjoy yourself and your partner. While I’ve primarily detailed honesty in physical relationships, I do believe honesty is important in every relationship whether that be with lovers, friends, family or even acquaintances,  and though the vulnerability and discomfort that comes with honesty is difficult to overcome, in the long run, your relationship, your partner and yourself will be able to benefit.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana Kamelian opens up about the benefits of honesty in our most intimate encounters.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82755\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/why-being-honest-is-sexy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82755\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/why-being-honest-is-sexy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/why-being-honest-is-sexy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/why-being-honest-is-sexy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/why-being-honest-is-sexy/","id":6294,"author":{"id":367,"name":"Aryana Kamelian"},"related":[6293,6292,6291],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":367,"name":"Aryana Kamelian","biography":"Not available","articles":[5613,6294],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Rules of Sex and Marriage","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sexreligionlife-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sexreligionlife-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Komal Surani questions the way we come to understand and follow the rules of sex and marriage.

As I grew older, things didn’t change. My parents, my religion — my family is among the least Muslim of all Muslims, but they still believe that sex is to be had after marriage — and my community treated sex and sexual pleasure as an ugly facet of a person, something that was evil and wrong. </p>\n<p>Every time I thought about sex or felt sexual pleasure, I told myself I was wrong and impure and would go to hell because my body was feeling something it shouldn’t be. It was enjoying something dirty. I was dirty. For the longest time I felt that my body and I did not deserve respect or care because people who gave in to disgusting temptations didn’t deserve good things. Over time and through a series of experiences, however, I came to believe that sexuality was not a bad thing to have.</p>\n<p>As a young, impressionable thirteen-year-old, I learned about sex. My parents gave me the sex talk. It went something like, “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” That was it. That was my sex talk. It was understood that this was not advice or optional. This was the rule. “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” My mother did not say anything about sexual pleasure. Sex is for procreation, not pleasure. Around that same time, my family got an iPad. I was often allowed to use/borrow it, so I used the internet occasionally to satisfy my sexual curiosity because I knew my parents wouldn’t approve of or answer some of the thoughts and feelings I was having about sex. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I found websites that I really shouldn’t have been looking at as a young middle-schooler. When my parents found out, they screamed at me. I remember they told me I was disgusting. What I wanted to know and what I felt about sex was wrong. They were disappointed in me. That night changed the way I felt about sex for years. To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression. </p>\n<p>I spent years believing my body was betraying me by feeling things I wasn’t supposed to. I imagined my sexuality as an evil force in my body, placed there by God to test whether or not I could resist temptation. Whenever I couldn’t, I reiterated what my parents had told me to myself: I was disgusting. I was dirty. I should be ashamed of myself and my body. </p>\n<p>I now believe my parents’ lecture should have been about internet safety, not sexual curiosity, they grew up in a different time. They grew up in Pakistan, in a religion and in an environment in which they were taught that sex was to reproduce and nothing more. Their parents instilled in them a set of very traditional, very rigid beliefs about their bodies that they very much came to live and breathe. </p>\n<p>My environment, however, was in America. In America, sex-ed is about safety, not about waiting until marriage. The people around me and the culture naturally influenced the way I felt about sex and eventually the way I would come to feel. My parents, not understanding that, attempted to regain control of me by talking about my body the way their parents had spoken about theirs. I cannot blame them for reacting in such a way, because that must have been how their own parents reacted when it came to sex. Sex is not wrong. It’s normal. And as a young teenager, it was something I should have been allowed to think about it, but my culture shamed me for wondering about sexual pleasure. </p>\n<blockquote><p>To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then, I began touring colleges my sophomore year, and I remember being in a hotel room with another Shia Imami Ismaili Nizari Muslim. We talked about the most taboo of subjects: sex. She was older than me and wondered on the most superficial of levels if she got married without sleeping with him, how would she know if he was good in bed? It was a small thing, but it started my “rebellious” thinking about sex. The summer before junior year, I went to a Muslim summer camp that taught confidence and self-acceptance. I became much more confident that year, and in the process I thought much more about whether or not my parents were right about sex. The summer before my senior year, I did some research, and I told myself that sex was not a bad thing. </p>\n<p>When school started, I talked to one of my counselors about it, and she reconfirmed what I very tentatively felt: Sex was normal. Thinking about sex was normal. I told myself this again and again, and I experienced sexual pleasure and orgasms without feeling guilty like I had in the past. As a result, I became a much more honest and open person and most definitely a much happier person because I knew I wasn’t disgusting or a freak or any other derogatory term my community assigned to people who thought sex could involve pleasure. </p>\n<p>I still wasn’t sure if I wanted to have sex before marriage, but one person told me something that tipped me over to the other side. She told me about a friend who had sexual experiences before she met the man she would marry. After marriage, she felt regret because she hadn’t waited to have sex with “the one.” Her advice to me was that if I was going to regret my experiences after marriage, then I should wait. As a person staunchly against regret, however, I believe a person’s experiences lead them to wherever — or whomever — they end up in life. </p>\n<p>Regretting who came before marriage might mean I never met my match. I also want to live life and experience all the experiences it has to offer me. I’m no longer against sex, before marriage, after marriage, whatever. As long as you take care of yourself and your body and treat yourself and your partner with respect, it shouldn’t matter when you have sex. If your partner doesn’t feel that way, then they might not be the one for you. The right person will respect you no matter what.</p>\n<p>My experience with sex and myself hasn’t always been easy. People, especially my family, have made it difficult. But that doesn’t mean that how I feel isn’t worth going forward with. I might have to fight every step of the way to say, “Yes, I am going on a date,” “Yes, I will be kissed,” “Yes, one day I will have sex,” “Yes, I will get birth control.” </p>\n<p>I have fought for all of these things, but that just makes them so much more important to me. These are my experiences — not my mother’s — that we’re talking about here. If you believe something in your life or a feel a certain way about something other people in your life don’t, that’s okay, as long as you don’t let their feelings get in the way of yours. I tell my mom all the time, “I respect your beliefs, you respect mine.”</p>\n<p><em>Komal Surani wants you to live your sexual life based on your own beliefs. </em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/","id":6291,"author":{"id":641,"name":"Komal Surani"},"related":[6290,6289,6288],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Attachment in an Unattached Love","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos tells us how to deal with feelings of attachment in an era where \"friends with benefits\" relationships and hookups reign.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Webster’s Dictionary, the word</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> attachment</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be defined as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the condition of being attached to something or someone in particular.

However, attachment is anything but simple. Attachment holds complexity, and above all, attachment holds power. It is what evokes our jealousy and insecurity. It is what complicates our sought-after “friends with benefits” relationships. It is what makes goodbyes feel like losses rather than opportunities for gain. Though attachment is a natural response to emotions and interpersonal relationships, it can often lead to negative feelings of fear and unease. Maybe it’s possible that attachment is simply unavoidable and embedded in our biology. But what if it is possible to gain control over this complicated and compelling force that is attachment?</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77060\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77060\" data-attachment-id=\"77060\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/20170412_133732-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1838&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1838\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"20170412_133732-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=250%2C224&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=888%2C797&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77060\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=888%2C797\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=250%2C224&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=768%2C689&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77060\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus / Anna Wade</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we seem to notice it the most in romantic relationships, attachment is something that dates all the way back to our infancy. Our attachment with our parents, specifically our mothers, is what guides our attachment styles in future relationships. There is no doubt that it acts as a natural, guiding force in our lives, allowing us to form bonds and maintain partnerships. Given the relaxed and casual dating culture we have moved toward in the last decade, many people gravitate toward the idea of a “no strings attached” or “hookup buddy” arrangement. It appears easy and fun, possessing the benefits of a relationship yet withholding the complications. However, as showcased in every romantic comedy since 2010, being friends with benefits just doesn’t always work out as smoothly as you think it will. Reasoning this from a scientific perspective is easy. When we cuddle, kiss or have sex, oxytocin is released into our bodies, building those emotions and attachments with or without our cognitive consent. That part of attachment truly is out of our control, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it no matter how hard we try. Rather, our control lies in our response to these emotions and attachment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mistake many people make when entering an “unattached” relationship comes from the misconception that they will be impervious to feelings. We often think of ourselves as invincible, possessing the ability to dictate how we feel and when we feel it. Whether we believe they are simply due to hormones or maybe something deeper like fate, we should know by now that this is never true. For some reason, society seems to view emotion as weakness, demanding that we learn to expunge or ignore them. Rather than attempting to acknowledge and understand them, we’re taught that it’s easier to just try casting them away. This idea of running from or hiding what we feel is based on nothing more than fear.  Learning to love unattached means rejecting that fear.  Learning to love unattached means recognizing, accepting and actually embracing the very emotions that attach us.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>When we acknowledge and respect our feelings, we are giving ourselves validation and love.

Whether it’s our mother, father, brother, friend or a person we’re wholeheartedly in love with, each of us is on our own individual journey. Remembering this makes it a lot easier to take away the personal aspects of attachment that make us feel jealous, insecure or doubtful. Second, we have to learn to accept the way we feel without the expectation that our wants and desires will be met. This doesn’t mean caring about the other person more than we care for ourselves; if anything it means the exact opposite. When we acknowledge and respect our feelings, we are giving ourselves validation and love. We give our minds and hearts a break when we remain honest and true rather than trying to force the reality we wish existed. Once we reach this level of truth and openness, the attachment that seems to control us can become more of a bond to be thankful for. Rather than feeling resentful or hurt at the fact that things are not as we wish they were, we can begin to see the reasons as to why they are not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loving unattached means we respect ourselves and our emotions as well as those of the ones we find ourselves attached to. It means we recognize and acknowledge where we are in life and where they are in theirs. It means always wanting the best for both ourselves and them, even if that means going down different paths. For some, maintaining unattached love requires maintaining boundaries, some of which may need to be physical. And though sex and affection can make unattached love seem more difficult, I believe always remaining honest and true can only lead to positive outcomes. Though we will never be able to un-attach ourselves from emotions, we can un-attach ourselves from insecurity and jealousy. We can un-attach ourselves from disappointment and regret. Most importantly, we can un-attach ourselves from the fear that detaches us from love.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to respect your feelings and set yourself free from

own education and its downfalls. I realized that while high schools fail to provide an adequate foundation for sexual education, universities do little to fix the damage. I contemplated what my high school did wrong and asked myself: what should UCSB  do to ensure that its students receive a comprehensive sexual health education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended an incredibly liberal private high school in the heart of Silicon Valley. While the school excelled in many ways and prepared us to succeed academically, they failed to prepare us for living as individuals in society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our required sex ed class took place during freshman year. It was a quarter long class that met  once a week for fifty minutes. Because of its bland and unengaged delivery, its lack of both general information and specifics and its decision not to hold us accountable for retaining the material, it was clear this would be a slack-off class. My fellow 14 and 15 year old classmates either used the class to frantically study for upcoming tests, zone out and take a much needed mental break, or hang out with friends and make crude jokes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of classes that we had to suffer through in school that were beyond boring. Even in classes with lifeless, passionless teachers, we were forced to be engaged. We were constantly cold-called, tested and asked to turn in assignments that prove our understanding. Zoning out, talking and working on material or studying for another class was actively prohibited. However, all of these actions were rampant in our sex ed course. So why was this all allowed to take place? Why were the sex ed class standards so different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it’s pretty clear. My school did not emphasize its importance as much as other subjects we studied. Literally every single class that students were required to take had some sort of testing system to ensure that students were actually learning the material. That is, every class except for sex ed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew the class was a joke, but it wasn’t until the beginning of my senior year that I realized how pathetic it really was. During my free period, my friend told a group of us that she finally got an IUD. She was super happy about it and recommended it to all of us. She said that, besides its obvious use to protect against pregnancy, it basically stopped her period and cleared her skin. The two girls I was sitting with responded by asking, “wait, what’s an IUD?” They were unaware of other contraceptives besides condoms and birth control pills, so they resorted to birth control — despite the negative physical reactions. Because their knowledge of contraceptives, like various IUDs or the NuvaRing, was sparse, the girls relied on their peers for sexual health information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girls peppered the IUD-bearer with a multitude of questions, reinforcing the nationwide trend of teens relying on other teens and the media to educate themselves and make up for their lack of a formal sexual education. This kind of behavior stems from poor education and leads to false rumors and facts. One example of these harmful rumors is Plan B does not work after you’ve taken it three times. Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I was shocked at the pure illiteracy of some of my peers when it came to basic sexual health and anatomy. I came to this realization during a conversation that took place in DLG at the beginning of my freshman year. My friend mentioned that her boyfriend had just gotten tested and that we should get tested, just to make sure. One girl stated that she didn’t need to get tested because she would be able to tell if she had one. What she did not understand is that many STIs are often asymptomatic. Another girl responded that she did not need to get tested because she only blows people. What she and many others fail to understand is that STIs can be transmitted through oral sex, even if you spit, and through pre-ejaculate via oral or vaginal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, their comments may just seem like pure ignorance or stupidity, but, when assessing the potential consequences of their actions or lack of actions, it reflects a public health concern. These girls’ lack of education is a reason why STIs are spreading. Even though we are in a time of incredibly modernized medicine, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections are at a record high. In fact, Chlamydia accounts for the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC states that, “one in two sexually active persons will contract an STI by age 25.” Why is this? Well, only about 12% of young people were tested in the last year (CDC), so people continue to spread them through unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STIs are not just a nuisance. They have lasting effects with grave consequences. New strains of STIs emerge every year that are becoming harder and harder to treat. The CDC estimates that, “nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year in this country”. One recent infection that has garnered attention is Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea. This strain is resistant to our current antibiotics, making it much harder to treat — sometimes impossible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it important that you treat STIs? Well, they can result in serious damage with lasting effects later in life. For instance, the CDC estimates that “undiagnosed STIs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.” Women are potentially made infertile if Chlamydia evolves into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, which is often a sign of carelessness as a result of a poor education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, there are a lot of great resources and information that UCSB provides to its students surrounding sexual health. However, most students are not taking advantage of these resources, even when they are in need of educating. So, what should UCSB be doing for its students to ensure that we all receive an acceptable sexual education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thought is to have a required online course, similar to that of sexual assault and drug and alcohol education course. However, the issue with these courses is that they are easy to skip through which makes it rather easy to not actually learn any of the information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea would be to make it a GE requirement to take a course similar to the Baldwins’ highly regarded Sociology of Human Sexuality course. The course covers topics such as abortion, birth control, emergency contraception, Planned Parenthood, STIs, domestic violence, and UCSB sex culture and statistics. It is not only one of the longest running classes taught in the history of UCSB, it is one of the most popular. The popularity of this class and the increase in STI testing directly after the STI lecture reveals that students are not only uninformed, but they also want to gain a better understanding of the subject. Requiring students to take this class, or a class with similar content, would serve the student body well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health. It should be more heavily integrated into university curriculums because college is meant not only to give degrees, but to prepare us for the future as informed citizens of the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Claire Horsley wants to ensure that Gauchos are as educated in the bedroom as they are in the classroom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/","id":6293,"author":{"id":646,"name":"Claire Horsley"},"related":[6292,6291,6290],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
