Cal Poly improves to 25-13 on the season and 7-2 in the Big West.

Mustangs junior pitcher Justin Calomeni then ended any hopes of a Gaucho comeback after striking out the last two batters, earning his sixth save, and giving his team the 4-3 victory and series sweep.</p>\n<p>Before finishing off the sweep, Cal Poly rallied of 10 runs while limiting Santa Barbara to five runs to—at the very least at the time—seal the series win over their blue rival.</p>\n<p>After allowing two runs in the top of the first inning, the Mustangs responded with a four-run first inning, due in large part to Sanderson two-RBI double, to take an early 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game at four in the top of the second inning thanks to senior third baseman Ryan Clark’s RBI single and redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s RBI single. Cal Poly added on run in the bottom frame to retake a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs would add two more runs in the bottom of the third inning to now take an even bigger lead at 7-4.</p>\n<p>By this point in the game, freshman pitcher Noah Davis (3-2) was sat after four innings. It was the young pitchers worst outing of the season allowing seven runs on eight hits including allowing one home run.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the rest of the game, Cal Poly added three runs compared to Santa Barbara’s one and won the game fairly easily after struggling to stop UCSB’s high-powered offense in the first few innings.</p>\n<p>It was another solid outing for star Mustang pitcher Erich Uelman (5-0) who pitched eight innings allowing five runs on eight hits but more importantly extended his perfect record this season to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Before losing only its second weekend series of the season, the Gauchos displayed their worst performance of the season being blanked 7-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB registered two hits over the course of nine innings, its worst total of the season but Cal Poly took advantage of its rival slow day scoring seven runs on thirteen hits.</p>\n<p>Gaucho junior pitcher Shane Bieber (7-2) kept the game close early allowing three runs in the games first six innings however, in the final two innings he came undone allowing four runs.</p>\n<p>Bieber came into the game hot off two straight complete-game victories and a 2.74 season ERA but was taken to school by the Mustang hitters and handed the pitcher his second loss of the season.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly won thanks to big performances from great players such as senior Josh Schuknecht who had two hits and three RBI, sophomore Josh George who went 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and Meyer who had two hits.</p>\n<p>The top four hitters of the Mustang line-up went 9-17 (.529) with six RBI in their strong victory over one of the better teams in the country.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was a bad one for the Gauchos. Not only did they get swept and now fell in the standings but really showed its vulnerability going on the road. They are now 4-8-1 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>With eight of its final 20 games on the road, UCSB cannot afford to drop all those games—especially the conference ones—simply because it is away from the comfort ability of home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on Tuesday, April 26 at 3 p.m. at Dickinson Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Look no further, as this once-a-year opportunity will let you cleanse both your sins and the gnarly, natty-daddy ridden streets of Del Playa. Don’t worry about having nothing to clean – the students of UCSB will keep you very busy. Join Adopt-A-Block and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) to help bring the pavement back to life. The clean up will take place this Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. To participate, sign up at the IVRPD office on 961 Embarcadero del Mar. Gloves, buckets and trash grabbers will all be provided to you free of cost. You might not be able to clean <i>everything</i>, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Not Bombs</strong></p>\n<p>Food not bombs is back with another opportunity to cook a free meal for your community! Even if Food Network wasn’t your go-to in the days before Netflix, don’t hesitate to dip your toes in the cooking world to make some food for a good cause! The event takes place this Sunday from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., you’ll begin cooking preparations at 777 Camino Pescadero. At 5 p.m., you’ll serve food to the community at Little Acorn Park and return to 777 Camino Pescadero at 6:15 p.m. to clean some dishes. They are in regular need of volunteers, so do the community a favor and brandish that ladle. There is no sign up – all you have to do is show up. Think of it like crashing a class.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineers Without Borders</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be real, we all know Hana Kitchen probably cooks better than your housemates. If you’d like to treat yourself with a meal out, you can easily kill two weeds with the same whacker by showing up to Hana Kitchen anytime this Friday from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some of the proceeds of your chicken bowl will be donated in support of the Engineers Without Borders project. With chapters in Rwanda and Kenya, the Engineers Without Borders plan on taking a trip to Panama this summer, so rip those chopsticks apart and get smackin’!</p>\n<p><strong>MAPAS</strong></p>\n<p>MAPAS, or Making Adventures Possible for all Students, is hosting a kayaking event this Friday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Fluency in swimming is recommended, but nobody will look twice if you show up in your floaties. In order to participate, check in at the UCSB Adventure Program station near Campus Point to pick up a kayak and celebrate the start of this glorious Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>SBKlub</strong></p>\n<p>If blasting Billboard’s Top 100 songs for 24 hours straight isn’t your kind of gig, then SBKlub might offer the perfect Deltopia alternative. If you like food, dancing, the beach or honestly anything, then this event might grab your eye – or your tongue – depending on how much of a palate you have for potluck.

Then this might be the right opportunity for you. Set yourself straight this weekend and join the Isla Vista Surfriders in an effort to pick those Natty Daddys out of the sand. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. this Sunday at Devereux Beach. If you know your volunteer credit is going to take a backseat later on this quarter, then don’t forget to bring your volunteer hour form to get credit for all your hard work. If your last weekend was particularly rough, we can pretend that didn’t happen. Weekend one truly started now, just don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p><b>BUST DOWN WITH BIKO</b></p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of neck cramps and stained white vans, then Biko Garage is no stranger to you. Wacko, Lead, Powerslave, The Dory’s and Cruelty will be putting the noise ordinance to work so you’ll have no reason to wallow in boredom tomorrow night. The event takes place this Thursday from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and is hosted by Biko Garage, located at 6612 Sueno Road. These fine musicians, from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles, have been shredding strings and breaking cymbals all along Southern California. Beer die is a weekend sport, so burn some real calories tomorrow night and forget that you have a section the next morning.</p>\n<p><b>GET DOWN AND DIRTY</b></p>\n<p>This Saturday, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, is hosting an event that you absolutely cannot scrap. The County Composting Workshop, held in conjunction with the Public Works department of Santa Barbara and the UC Santa Barbara Department of Public Worms, will be teaching attendees how to properly manage their backyard compost. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and will teach you what foods can be composted as well as how to properly compost food. The event is only hosted once a year, so don’t miss out! If you stay the whole time, you’ll also be eligible to win your very own worm-composting bin! Now who wouldn’t want that?</p>\n<p><b>COP SOME FRESH THREADS</b></p>\n<p>Have bad spending habits and a bad eye for clothing? Look no further. Santa Barbara-based collector Andi Mondugno has pre-selected all the lovely attire set at painless prices. Swing by the Isla Vista Food Co-op at 6575 Seville Road this Sunday anytime from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and peruse the visually-delectable array of clothes, shoes and accessories.

No, not the PBS show. NOVA Nights at Rockfire Grill will fill the burger bastillon this Friday from 9 p.m. to 12 p.m. with a medley of dance-friendly music.

Santa Barbara is trying to capture its first Big West title since 1986.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good start so far and I like the way we are playing,” Redshirt junior Andrew Calica said. “and we just hope to continue with that momentum.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite of the spectrum, Cal Poly is looking to take a series from another great conference opponent after taking two of three from both Hawaii and the defending Big West champion Titans of CSUF.</p>\n<p>These two teams met a year ago with UCSB taking the series after winning the opening match, 8-7, and the closing match, 7-3. The Gauchos lead the all-time series 119-101.</p>\n<p>The last four seasons the winner of the Blue-Green rival has been the host team, meaning this year the Mustangs holds that advantage.</p>\n<p>Combine that with the fact that the Gauchos have a losing record on the road, 4-5-1 to be exact, and it spells trouble for the young team. However, they are not fazed by the challenge awaiting them in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to think that we as a team are mature enough to not let something like being away from home be a factor.” Calica said.</p>\n<p>The challenge however, will not be easy as UCSB is taking on a Cal Poly team leads the conference in walks (157) and that ranks second in on-base percentage (.379), runs scored (172), and RBI (156).</p>\n<p>The team is led by the only two returning starters in junior catcher/first baseman Brett Barbier and senior outfielder Josh Schuknecht.</p>\n<p>Barbier leads the team in batting average (.384), hits (48), extra-base hits (13), slugging percentage (.536) and leads the conference in on-base percentage (.536). Schuknecht leads the team in RBI (28) and is second in home runs with three.</p>\n<p>“They will probably bat aggressive early.” Bieber said. “This is Big West play and all teams just want to come our strong but we will be ready defensively.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will also look to former Big West Player of the Week, freshman outfielder Alex McKenna, to help the team with the long ball as he has had five of them this season, a team high.</p>\n<p>However, Friday’s game will be a tough one for these batters as they will the newly named Big West Pitcher of the Week, Shane Bieber (7-1).</p>\n<p>Beiber received the honors after throwing a complete game shutout last Friday against CSUN and only allowing four hits throughout the contest.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to have that honor.” Beiber said. “It helps that I think we got the best defense in the west coast backing me up because they make plays that allow me to go all nine.”</p>\n<p>This season the junior has the most wins of any pitcher in the Big West (7) and with a win this Friday will match his career high in wins. The right hander’s 2.74 ERA and 49 strikeouts both rank ninth in the conference among pitchers.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted the Gauchos have the best relieving pitcher in sophomore Kyle Nelson who has the best ERA in the Big West (1.23) and the best opposing batting average (.157).</p>\n<p>Not only will Cal Poly be worried about UCSB’s ability to pitch but also the slew of hitters they have at the helm.</p>\n<p>Leading off the Gauchos each game has been redshirt junior Andrew Calica who ranks first in the conference in walks (27) and second in on-base percentage (.487). The center-fielder currently leads the team in hits (34) and is fifth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Other notable hitters include sophomore Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (24), redshirt sophomores Josh Adams and J.J Muno who both are tied for the team lead in home runs with four and redshirt junior Devon Gradford who leas the team in batting average (.370).</p>\n<p>This weekend will be all about the Gauchos trying to keep their first place standing as well as continually improving as it has each week. The historical season they are on cannot be squandered by looking ahead, the Gauchos need to stay vigilant and keep on playing the way they have which has resulted in 25 wins in 33 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is against their Green counterpart Cal Poly Friday April 22 at 6 p.m. at Baggett Stadium. The next two games are at the same place Saturday and Sunday at 6 and 1 p.m. respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
