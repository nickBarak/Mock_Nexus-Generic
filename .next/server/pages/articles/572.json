We’re going to have to do a lot of things well to beat them on their home court,” Mitchell said. “The competitive side of me wants to win, but I want to win more for the seniors and I want to win more for this program and having the chance to win championships, and right now, that’s going through Poly.”</p>\n<p>In fact, only three players on the UCSB roster know the feeling of defeating the team’s biggest rival. Dating back to March 5, 2011, the seniors, guards Destini Mason, Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig, helped earn a 78-67 on the road over Cal Poly to become co-Big West Champions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now get another shot at Cal Poly Saturday when Mitchell and her squad open Big West play in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve haven’t beaten them since our freshman year, and not even on our home floor,” Zornig said. “It’s pretty frustrating, especially since some of the games have been close. I think for us seniors, it’d be huge to come out and beat them.”</p>\n<p>Both teams enter Saturday’s installment of the Blue-Green rivalry with recent struggles. At 5-8 overall, Santa Barbara has lost five of its last six games. Similarly, Cal Poly has dropped three of its last four, but Wednesday night improved to 7-7 overall and 1-0 in the Big West with a 78-74 overtime victory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Playing a long game Wednesday in Hawaii and then returning home for a game Saturday presents a taxing travel schedule for the Mustangs. Last season, teams who played Hawaii at the beginning of the week went 0-4 in their following game that weekend.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on top of the Blue-Green rivalry and defending a five-game winning streak over UCSB, Cal Poly will have the motivation of defending its home court, where the team is 5-0 so far this season.</p>\n<p>“You know you’re going to expect energy with the tradition these two programs have had and the rivalry,” Mitchell said. “I don’t have to say anything and I’m sure [Cal Poly Head Coach Faith Nimnaugh] doesn’t have to say anything for the players to show up and understand how important this game is.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in previous years for the Gauchos was the Mustang’s potent offense, which will once again serve as a challenge as Cal Poly tops the Big West in scoring with 74.9 points per game. Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions also rank second in the conference in field goal percentage and three point percentage, shooting 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Option number one on the offensive end for Cal Poly is the reigning Big West Player of the Year, 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer. Schlemer ranks third in the Big West in points per game (17.8), first in rebounding (10.8) and second in field goal percentage (54.7 percent).</p>\n<p>Taking the assignment on Schlemer will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins, who averages a team-high 7.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals in her three games with UCSB after transferring from Vanderbilt.</p>\n<p>“All five times (we’ve lost) the problem has been on the defensive side of it. We have to try to figure out a way to guard Molly,” Mitchell said. “Even though (last year’s senior center Kirsten) Tilleman was blue-collar and had the toughness, she was legit 6’1’’,” Mitchell said. “This year, we’ve worked on a lot more zone, so I think we can mix it up a lot more where it’s not just one on one post defense.”</p>\n<p>However, Schlemer is one of just several options for the Mustangs offensively. The team also features two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last season in a pair of point guards. Junior Ariana Elegado is currently averaging 15.5 points and a team-high 4.6 assists per game, good enough to tie her for first in the Big West. Senior Jonae Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. Wednesday night against Hawaii, Ervin exploded for a career-high 37 points and team-high 10 rebounds to help her team come back from 17 down to win.</p>\n<p>“As seniors we know what to expect and I’m telling [our teammates], ‘be ready for these guards’ because they’re no joke,” Mason said. “They’re very talented and smart and know how to play together.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, if UCSB wants a chance for a victory, it will have to play incredible defense. While not as dominant as in previous years, the Gauchos still rank third in the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then have to finish the job defensively by rebounding. Cal Poly leads the conference in rebounding at 43.9 per game while UCSB ranks last in the category with just 32.5 boards per game. In addition, in victories, the Gauchos average 37.8 rebounds compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re full fronting and you need to roll to get in rebounding position or you got caught behind, you have to put a body on [Molly],” Mitchell said. “She’s big and you have to make the refs call it. You’re not going to get any calls unless you block out and make contact.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB is a much improved team this year, putting up an average of 67.1 points on the scoreboard each outing, almost 15 more points per game than in Mitchell’s previous two seasons. The Gauchos also lead the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos have succeeded with the fast break, Saturday will be all about defense.</p>\n<p>“We definitely don’t want a track meet. We’re not going to outscore anyone and I’ll continue to say that we have the ability to score high 60’s and 70’s any given night,” Mitchell said. “Defense will be the emphasis. I probably won’t even write any offenses on the board because I think if we can do the things we need to on the defensive end of things, we’ll have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A. Mott Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Mustangs lead the Big West in points per game at 74.9 while ranking second in field goal percentage and three*point percentage at 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ biggest offensive threat is down low in 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer, the reigning Big West Player of the Year. Schlemer ranks third in the conference in scoring with 17.8 points per game and first in rebounding at 10.8 per contest. Her 54.7 percent shooting from the field also tops the league.</p>\n<p>“Molly Schlemer is a big reason for our success,” Mimnaugh said. “She’s pretty money when she gets the ball in her hands, and her teammates are always looking for her.”</p>\n<p>Yet, Schlemer is one of several options for Cal Poly, who also returns two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last year in junior guard Ariana Elegado and senior guard Jonae Ervin. Elegado currently averages 15.5 points and 4.6 assists per game, which ties for first in conference, while Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists, good enough for third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Both Jonae and Ariana picked up where they left off last year,” Mimnaugh said. “Jonae is one of the top assist to turnover people, so the ball is pretty safe in her hands. Ariana is a tremendous creator. We’ve got some littles that are entertaining.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s next game is Saturday when it hosts UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii</strong></p>\n<p>The Hawaii women’s basketball team is on a mission to redeem itself after last year’s disappointing second-round exit in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Rainbow Wahine finished with a 13-5 record in the Big West in large part to its efficiency on offense and defense; the team finished third both in scoring offense (61.1) and scoring defense (56.2). Despite earning a third place seed in the conference tournament, Hawaii was upset in the quarterfinal stage by Cal State Fullerton, the lowest-seeded team in the field.</p>\n<p>After nine months of lingering on that loss, the Rainbow Wahine are back with arguably the most dominant player in the Big West in senior forward Kamilah Jackson. Jackson is coming off a year where she was third in the league in points (15.5) and rebounds (9.7). It was the third straight season she led the team in points and rebounds.</p>\n<p>This year, Jackson was selected to the Preseason All-Big West team and has picked up where she left off last year. Averaging 16.7 points to go along with 10.0 rebounds, she has already amassed seven double-doubles. Jackson will have to be Hawaii’s best player on the court if it plans to advance further in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Hawaii enters conference play with an even record after losing and winning six games during its nonconference schedule. Yet, the team was picked to finish second in the Big West preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine has been victim to tough losses so far, losing to No. 24 Arizona by an 84-44 margin and against USC 66-55, where Jackson was held to just five points.</p>\n<p>However, the Rainbow Wahine has also come away with impressive nonconference results. Hawaii has defeated opponents from the Pac-12, SEC and Big 10 during the run-up to the conference opener against Cal Poly, showing potential of its capability to win the Big West title this season.</p>\n<p>Currently, Hawaii has not been as statistically efficient on offense as compared to last season as it ranks near the bottom of the league in points scored (64.8), while the team’s defense has kept them afloat; the team is second in points allowed (66.2). Still, Hawaii will have to have a balanced attack if they are to become serious contenders.</p>\n<p>Hawaii begins conference play with its first two games at home, taking on Cal State Northridge Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team had a rough start to its season, going 4-10 in non-conference play, but it is a serious contender to take the Big West.</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason media poll, the Matadors were selected to finish third place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>With one of the toughest nonconference schedules in the Big West, the Matadors saw extremely tough competition, taking on BYU, Washington State, Saint Mary’s and Oregon. While this gave CSUN many losses, the team also earned quality victories over incredible competition, earning a one-point victory over Pac-12 USC and a 12 point win over a talented Northern Arizona squad.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there is anything we cannot improve on,” Head Coach Jason Flowers said. “We have to play with consistency and a focused mentality on every possession.”</p>\n<p>Playing such stiff competition, out of the nine teams in the Big West, offensively CSUN is eighth in shooting percentage, seventh points per game and eighth in three point shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>However, offense isn’t really Northridge’s bread and butter anyway. Under Flowers, the Matadors have proved a scrappy defensive team, ranking second in the Big West in steals with 9.6 per game.</p>\n<p>A young team in previous years, Northridge now features a core of upperclassmen.</p>\n<p>Among the Matadors, 5’5” junior guard Cinnamon Lister leads all scorers with 15.9 points per game. Junior guard Ashlee Guay also adds 14.3 points per game to give Northridge a respectable one-two punch.</p>\n<p>Shouldering the load of providing the post presence could be up to 6’3” sophomore center Bernadette Fong and 6’2” junior center Camille Mahlknecht. After averaging 5.2 and 6.4 rebounds per game, respectively, in the first half of the season, the Matadors will look for them to approach double digits. 6’2” senior forward Mikayla Thielges actually leads the team with 6.6 rebounds per game, but spends too much time around the perimeter to be counted on as the team’s primary board collector.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Mahlknecht gives the Matadors a serious defensive presence inside, easily topping the conference in blocks per game at 2.6.</p>\n<p>“If we focus on the process and approach the season one day at a time, one possession at a time, then the results will follow,” Flowers said.</p>\n<p>Northridge begins conference play today with a visit to UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State</strong></p>\n<p>The Long Beach State women’s basketball team enters the New Year with the best overall record in the conference at 8-6. After a middle-of-the-road 2013 campaign in which they finished with a 16-16 overall and 9-9 conference record, good for fifth place, the 49ers were predicted to finish fourth in this year’s preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better every week and finding more continuity,” Head Coach Jody Wynn said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of players coming in and out of the lineup due to sickness or injury, but I’m happy with our effort and our focus level that we’ve had throughout the preseason and the way we competed game in and game out.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing three of last season’s starters, Long Beach has not been slowed down by its consistent lineup changes. Although she has only started six games, freshman guard Raven Benton has impressed with team-high averages of 14.5 points and 5.4 rebounds per game as well as a 47.7 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been very pleased with how quickly Raven has adapted to the college level,” Wynn said. “She is not afraid of contact, so she’s able to get in there and fight for rebounds and she’s a natural born scorer. I always knew she had the potential to be a very good player for us.”</p>\n<p>Another young player making an impact for the 49ers is freshman guard Anna Kim, who leads her team with a 38.9 three-point percentage and 1.93 steals per game.</p>\n<p>A strong core of veterans has anchored a balanced Long Beach offensive attack that is averaging a solid 70 points per game. Junior guard Alex Sanchez has the team’s second highest scoring average with 11.2 points per game, while junior guard Hallie Meneses is averaging 8.0 points per game, team-highs of 4.1 assists per game and a 92.6 free throw percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a good strong core group of juniors that have multiple years of experience and with that being said our freshmen have been thrown into the fire right away,” Wynn said. “Anna Kim has certainly made an impact right away at the point guard position. We rotate lineups a lot; nothing is set in stone [at this point].”</p>\n<p>The 49ers are not particularly intimidating in the middle, but junior forward Ella Clark has averaged 1.64 blocks and 8.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The Big West has more parity than it’s ever had, so game in and game out it’s going to be a dogfight,” Wynn said. “It’s going to be a battle of will down the stretch of a lot of games.”</p>\n<p>With a strong, balanced offense, a confident start and a good mix of young and veteran players, Long Beach could very easily go beyond its preseason prediction and challenge for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>The 49ers begin conference play tonight against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong></p>\n<p>With preseason play behind them, the UC Davis women’s basketball team boasts a young roster with veteran experience. Despite only having one returning senior, the Aggies possess key players such as junior forward Sydnee Fipps and sophomore guard Molly Greubel that will help to lead the team in this upcoming conference season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies ended the non-conference portion of their season with an overall record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>UC Davis women’s basketball was picked to finish sixth by the Big West preseason media poll. The Aggies earned 72 points from media members and were placed ahead of Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine and lastly UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Aggies finished 12-18 overall last season, 7-11 in the Big West and were defeated in the first round of the Big West Conference tournament. This first round knock out was unusual for a team that has been to the Big West Championship half of its first six years in the league. Head Coach Jennifer Gross will return for her third season with hopes of taking her team all the way.</p>\n<p>The Aggies biggest asset towards hopes at a championship finish lies with Fipps. Fipps, a first-team All-Big West selection as a sophomore in 2012-13, earned all-conference honors in the preseason poll after starting all 30 games for the Aggies last season, averaging a team-high 17.1 points (second in the conference) and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting .443 from the floor, .319 from three-point range and .817 from the line.</p>\n<p>Her preseason performance was nothing short of this, tallying her second-straight double-double in their final game against Simpson University.</p>\n<p>Another promising player for this upcoming season is Gruebel. Despite her young age, Gruebel has demonstrated maturity and confidence on the court. She had a career night against Pacific with three assists, three steals and career high 18 points. In addition, she contributed two of the Aggies’ total five three-pointers.</p>\n<p>This Aggie team has knowledge working on their side. With a veteran team, and returning coaching staff they should be able to build upon what they have accomplished in preseason and work towards another shot at the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>UC Davis’ first conference matchup will be tomorrow, Jan. 9, against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine</strong></p>\n<p>With Big West play set to begin, the UC Irvine women’s basketball team has high hopes.</p>\n<p>At 7-7 overall, the season thus far has been somewhat surprising for the Anteaters. Although predicted to finish eighth in the Big West preseason media poll, if the season were to end right now, Irvine would find itself in second place in conference.</p>\n<p>Irvine currently ranks second in the Big West in scoring and rebounding, averaging 71.0 points and 43.0 rebounds per game. The Anteaters also place second in conference from behind the arc, shooting 31.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Camille Buckley has been the Anteaters’ most significant contributor thus far, averaging 14.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per contest, good enough for third in the Big West. She shoots an impressive 48.1 from the field and has contributed a team-high 21 steals this season.</p>\n<p>Also a huge benefit to the team has been senior guard Jennifer Tsurumoto, who is averaging 13.4 points and 3.2 assists for Irvine. Then there is junior guard Madison McKenney, who leads the league in three-point percentage at 41.7 percent.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters have been dominant at the Bren Center in Irvine and are undefeated at home at 3-0. Through their undefeated home stance, UC Irvine has beaten South Dakota, New Mexico State and La Verne College.</p>\n<p>In Irvine’s latest game against La Verne, the Anteaters dismantled their opponent 90-53. Senior forward Jasmine Bernard led Irvine with a career-high 24 points and eight rebounds. The Anteaters 37-point victory was their largest since 1999.</p>\n<p>Irvine will open conference play today at Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton</strong></p>\n<p>“Our goal is to compete night in and night out to give our team the chance to win the Big West,” Head Coach Daron Park said. “The goal for our team, as well as every team, should be to end the season cutting the net down from the hoop.”</p>\n<p>Led by junior guard Chante Miles, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has a 4-9 record heading into conference play. Miles leads the team with 15 points per game, along with 4.2 assists and 2.8 rebounds.</p>\n<p>With four returning starters, the Titans have experience to build on their 11-22 record last season. Last year, Fullerton made it all the way to the Big West semifinal against the odds, almost overcoming Pacific to make the final.</p>\n<p>This season, the Titans were selected to finish seventh in the Big West, making them the underdogs once again.</p>\n<p>First-year coach Park brings intelligence from many different programs as he was Associate Head Coach at USC last year, and Assistant coach at California the year before that.</p>\n<p>“Every day when we come to practice, we make sure to work on the little things,” Park said. “If we can do the little things and compete for every ball then we always give ourselves the chance to win.”</p>\n<p>While just 4-9, Fullerton has faced still competition in the preseason as they played San Diego, Arizona St. and Seattle.</p>\n<p>“The difficult non-conference schedule has made us prepared for conference play,” Park said.</p>\n<p>Fullerton begins conference play tonight against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside</strong></p>\n<p>With its preseason record in pattern with that of the last two years, the UC Riverside women’s basketball team lands itself tied for eighth place going into Big West conference play.</p>\n<p>“We are very much younger than some of the other teams in the conference, having only one senior,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “The more experience you have, the more advantages you have.”</p>\n<p>While the young Highlanders’ team continues to struggle to support the weight of the legacy that the 2011 conference champion team left behind, the team’s current 4-9 preseason record leaves Riverside toward the back of the pack.</p>\n<p>“The conference has changed, we’ve had a lot of injuries the last couple of years and we have a different team than the one that we won with,” Margaritis said.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss of older players in recent seasons, Riverside is home of guard Brittany Crain, returning for her sophomore year after being named Big West Conference Freshman of the Year. She is currently ranked first in the league in average points and steals per game and is ranked fifth in the league for field goal percentage. Crain averages a 49.7 field goal percentage, and averages 18.9 points and 2.2 steals per game.</p>\n<p>In addition, sophomore guard Annelise Ito is ranked fourth in the league for overall rebounds, and leads the team in both offensive and defensive rebounds, averaging 7.3 total per game in her first year playing for the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>While individually, Riverside has many strong players, as a team they average 18.8 turnovers per game and only 6.9 steals. With little defensive recovery contributed by much of the team, Riverside isn’t able to put up the points to win games.</p>\n<p>“The conference is well coached, and there are many good teams and players,” Margaritis said. “You play one game at a time and see where you are.”</p>\n<p>Riverside will start their conference season at home against Cal State Fullerton today.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Versions of these articles appeared on pages 8 and 9 of January 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-previews/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-previews/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-previews/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-previews/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-previews/","id":569,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[568,567,566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Battle of the Beach Schools","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"First Place UCSB Travels to Hawaii to Take on the Rainbow Warriors","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Road trips are always a time for team bonding and as the UCSB men’s basketball team embarks on its longest road trip of the season this week, the Gauchos must attempt to balance the strains of travel and the lure of a new place when they face Hawaii tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest tied for first place in the Big West with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 record in conference play.

The victories propelled UCSB back into first place after a weekend, which saw them fall to Cal State Fullerton and narrowly escape UC Riverside in overtime.</p>\n<p>“After the loss to Fullerton it was kind of another wake up for us to realize that if we don’t come ready to play each night, teams that may not have the best record can easily come out here and beat us,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos with a pair of monster performances last weekend was junior center Alan Williams. The big man garnered his fourth Big West Player of the Week Award this season after he averaged 26.5 points, 15 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two victories.</p>\n<p>Also of importance was the emotional return of sophomore guard John Green on Saturday against Davis. Green played in his first regular season game as a Gaucho after injuries derailed his collegiate career over the past three years. It will certainly be of interest to see how Green progresses and emerges into Santa Barbara’s rotation of wing players including Boswell, sophomore guard Michael Bryson and sophomore forward Taran Brown.</p>\n<p>With a return to health for the majority of its lineup and riding two important conference victories, the Gauchos are certainly poised to continue their run as a contender in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to come out last week and get two solid wins,” Boswell said. “It definitely gives us momentum, and we feel like we can compete with any team in the conference and that we’re the best team in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s matchup will certainly challenge the Gauchos, however, as the Rainbow Warriors are victorious in four of their past five games. Hawaii boasts an impressive 11-3 home record and leads the conference in scoring with over 82 points per game, over eight points better than the second ranked team.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be a tough game. They got some solid wins in the preseason and they have a lot of talent on their team,” Boswell said. “They’ve got some guards that are really quick and can push the tempo and they’ve also got some big guys that are a force to be reckoned with down low. We’ve just got to come out with a lot of energy like we have the last few games and play hard and let the game come to us.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Christian Standhardinger leads Hawaii in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.6) per game, ranking third and fifth in the conference, respectively. The Rainbow Warriors also tout sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year. Fotu ranks in the top 10 of the conference in both points and rebounds. Junior guard Garrett Nevels also places in the top 10 in Big West scoring, giving the Rainbow Warriors three top scorers.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be really difficult; Standhardinger is an awesome player. He gets to the foul line and is one of the best in our league,” Boswell said. “He’s a force in terms of driving to the basket and creating contact. You can’t completely eliminate a factor like him but if we can keep him contained, and make him work for his points and don’t give him second chance opportunities … I think we’ll have a pretty good shot at taking down the Warriors.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They’re doing what you want as you build a program for your seniors to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way offensively for UCSB is two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection Nicole Nesbit, who leads the team and ranks second in the Big West in scoring at 18.1 points per game. Shooting 46.8 percent from the field, the senior guard also tops her team in three-point shooting at 39.5 percent and assists with 3.4 per game.</p>\n<p>Returning to her natural position of shooting guard this season, Nesbit has been given the green light to score and will have the ball in her hands during clutch situations. On Dec. 19, Nesbit joined the 1,000 point club, one of just 25 players in program history to hit this incredible milestone.</p>\n<p>“She’s always had the God-given ability,” Mitchell said. “She has a great jumper; she can score in a variety of ways, but I think it’s more the mental side and the confidence (this year) that she doesn’t let one play to dictate her mindset the rest of the game.”</p>\n<p>The second of UCSB’s three seniors is known for her versatility and defense. Playing positions one through four this year, guard Destini Mason averages 6.2 rebounds per game, second on the squad and tops among guards. She also adds 1.1 steals and .6 blocks per contest.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most improvement for Mason can be seen on the offensive end. Currently averaging 13.2 points per game, Mason has broken her career-high three times already this season, culminating against Hampton when she scored 23 points, 10 higher than her career-high last season.</p>\n<p>“Destini has played multiple positions for us and she’s done a great job at the four spot,” Mitchell said. “It’s allowed her to be in rebounding position because that’s what we were lacking, but we’ll need to move her back to the three spot a lot because defensively she gives us a guard with length.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final senior has been known for her shooting since her arrival at UCSB, but this year, guard Melissa Zornig has developed into an all-around player. Doing a bit of everything for the Gauchos, Zornig is currently averaging 12.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. At 2.5, she holds the highest assist to turnover ratio of the team, which is also good enough for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Zornig also leads the team and the Big West in free throw percentage, shooting 88.4 percent. Combined with Nesbit, the two give UCSB two of the top three shooters from the charity stripe in the league.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest stat that stands out to me is her assist to turnover ratio,” Mitchell said. “She’s making the right decisions. She’s not shooting it as well from the three-point line, but she’s learned to score in a variety of ways, which makes her have an impact on games every night.”</p>\n<p>With their veteran leadership, UCSB’s “Big Three” have led the Gauchos to a 5-8 start. While its record may not look all that impressive, the team that has been to the postseason the last two seasons saw stiff competition during the non-conference portion of its schedule as Santa Barbara faced teams such as Arizona, St. Mary’s, San Diego State and Kansas State.</p>\n<p>UCSB lacks no experience playing in close games either with over half of the Gauchos’ games thus far being decided in the final minutes.</p>\n<p>“I think there are probably two or three games we had a chance to win, so our record would look a little bit different. But playing bigger, stronger, quicker in the non-conference will help us as we get to Big West play,” Mitchell said. “As a team, we’re where we need to be individually skilled wise and our team understanding roles.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in those losses was height. With only three forwards on the roster, and all being underclassmen, the average height on the Santa Barbara roster was 5’9’’.</p>\n<p>However, the height dilemma was resolved Dec. 20 when junior forward Clair Watkins was cleared by the NCAA to play for UCSB. At 6’4’’, Watkins transfers from Vanderbilt where she played two seasons with the Commodores. Now a grad student, the Gauchos had to wait for Watkins’ acceptance into the school. Once accepted, the NCAA immediately cleared her to play.</p>\n<p>In her three games as a Gaucho, Watkins has given Santa Barbara exactly what it was missing. Averaging 4.0 points and 1.0 block per game as well as team-highs in rebounding and steals with 7.0 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Watkins gives UCSB a defensive presence inside that will allow the team to compete with other teams in the Big West with height.</p>\n<p>“Clair allows us to be able to execute more in the half court, which I think all great teams have to at championship time,” Mitchell said. “With her body type and experience playing in the SEC, it is the defense and rebounding that will add the most to our team.”</p>\n<p>Currently last in the conference in rebounding at just 32.5 boards per game, rebounding has been a significant factor for UCSB in the win-loss column. Santa Barbara grabs 37.8 rebounds in victories compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“As soon as the ball goes up, we have to find a body and be aggressive,” Mason said. “Be the aggressor. We have to go after the ball. It takes heart, will and positioning.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s success in past years, with just five returning players from last season and a lack of height until the addition of Watkins, Santa Barbara remains the underdog going into conference play.</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason media poll, UCSB was predicted to finish fifth behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. In addition, no Gaucho was picked to the preseason all-Big West Conference first team, although Nesbit is averaging more points than the reigning Big West Player of the Year, Molly Schlemer from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Gauchos don’t mind being the underdog. The last time they were in a similar position, they won the Big West Tournament as the sixth seed.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be the underdog,” Zornig said. “We’ll go and prove people wrong.”</p>\n<p>In fact, this may be the team with the most potential under the Carlene Mitchell era as UCSB is putting more points on the scoreboard than any other team during Mitchell’s reign. Santa Barbara is currently averaging 67.1 points per game, much higher than the average 52.3 during the previous two seasons. The Gauchos also rank first in the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>In addition, despite the team’s new run and gun style, UCSB leads the conference in turnovers, giving the ball up just 13.8 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“When we pass the ball and we’re less selfish, we don’t have a lot of turnovers and we win the game, so I think that’s the main key to less turnovers is playing as a team,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>But at the heart of any team coached by Mitchell will always be defense. While not atop the Big West standings as in previous years, Santa Barbara still ranks third in the league in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game. When the game has been on the line, it’s been UCSB’s defense that has clinched victories.</p>\n<p>“We all know we can score, which is obviously different than last year, but the key for conference play will be our defense,” Zornig said. “We’re only going to win if we play defense.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins conference play Saturday at rival Cal Poly for the first Blue-Green rivalry match-up of the New Year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-preview-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-preview-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-preview-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-preview-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/big-west-preview-ucsb/","id":571,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[570,569,568],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
