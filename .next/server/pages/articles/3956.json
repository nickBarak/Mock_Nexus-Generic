Its purpose was to serve as an alternative to what Schunk called “over-policing.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Public Safety Commission (ASPSC) later took charge of UCIV, and the program only operated during Deltopia and Halloween in the years to follow. When Minoiefar entered the office, he intended to work alongside ASPSC to make the program a weekly operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Expansion of the program had a “slower start,” he said, because ASPSC relied mostly on their hired staff. They later found more success when they were able to “build more of a volunteer pool.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he assisted ASPSC in marketing for volunteers, suggesting to the UCIV organizers that they open the opportunity for different student groups to “sponsor a weekend.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One student group that did this recently, Minoiefar said, was Campus Democrats, which provided “a bunch of volunteers” for the weekend they sponsored.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[UCIV] is headed in the right direction, and I’m really happy to know that it’s going to stay here after I leave,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another goal for Minoiefar was to implement a policy of medical amnesty, which would protect UCSB students from legal charges if they are hospitalized while committing unlawful activities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar had been working with A.S. President Austin Hechler for over a year to regulate medical amnesty. Hechler said they came up with the idea after the university held a fraternity chapter liable for an unconscious partygoer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the problem exists outside this specific incident as well, saying students in residence halls and other groups, like sports teams, are often afraid to call 911 during parties.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Medical amnesty is state law, but it is not currently part of university policy. Minoiefar and Hechler have, for the past year, been drafting a new campus regulation called “the responsible action protocol.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the draft passed a UCSB Campus Regulation committee “at the very beginning of this quarter,” and it now awaits approval by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar will soon be meeting with officials from UCSB Judicial Affairs to discuss implementation of the responsible action protocol, which he said is “really, really important.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’ve seen it work with student groups a lot … Students know that they can call [911] and be safe,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar also set out this year to decrease police presence at Deltopia, I.V.’s annual Spring Break celebration along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Both UCPD and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) sent fewer police officers to Isla Vista this Deltopia, anticipating smaller crowds than in years prior. UCPD deployed approximately 70 officers for Deltopia this year, down from approximately 100 in 2016. SBSO did not want to disclose the number of officers it assigned.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Attendance increased to approximately 8,000 people this year, up from approximately 3,500 in 2016. Police made 42 different arrests this year, which is slightly more than last year but significantly lower than the number of arrests made the previous year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There were a total of 14 medical transports this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think Deltopia was a good enough of an event,” Minoiefar said. “I really wish that the [number of] medical transports could have been a lot lower. That, for me, is a benchmark of a successful day: making sure people are safe.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said several factors played into the decreased police presence at Deltopia this year. For one, he said police have “caught on” to public perceptions of having law enforcement at the event. He said having Spring Insight on the same weekend also helped.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[Deltopia] being on Spring Insight kinda helped because the school wanted a good image there and was obviously concerned with how parents see this campus,” he said. “I wish we would have gotten on that train a little faster.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he sees Deltopia 2016 as a “measuring point” for what police presence during Deltopia could look like in future years.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would argue that I think it was a manageable day,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he came into the EVPLA “pretty aware of what it’s like,” having for years prior been involved in I.V.’s political scene.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I guess one thing that kind of surprised me was the degree of the kind of power that student leadership has,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The EVPLA really can establish himself as a mobilizer of student interests and a representative of student interests,” he said. “They are really heeded and looked to for a lot of answers, which was very … enlightening.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In his year serving in the position, Minoiefar said he has grown to be more of a delegator in his leadership style, whereas he said he used to be “kind of a micromanager.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristen Armellini, Minoiefar’s deputy chief of staff, said she has also saw this growth in Minoiefar, especially when it came to sending representatives to meetings on his behalf.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was going to meetings for him, and he really wanted to make sure I knew the position through and through,” she said. “He would let me go to meetings for him [and] would make sure we were educated on everything.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Madison Hechler, the EVPLA chief of staff, said Minoiefar teaching her was “an opportunity for him to share his passion for Isla Vista” and not a “chore.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar plans to receive his degree in history of public policy in June. He will be starting an internship with the San Francisco District Attorney’s office, which he said is along the line of work that he hopes to go into.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really taken interest in law,” he said. “Public safety has always been a big part of what I do. I’ve always been keen on public service, and being a district attorney seems like a very engaging experience.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/","id":3956,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3955,3954,3953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

Elections Board claimed soon after election night in April that the Interfraternity Council (IFC) gave “monetary incentives” to its members who voted, alleging the organization believed votes could be “bought and sold.” The board called for a revote of the entire spring ballot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77392\" data-attachment-id=\"77392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/as-austin-candidate-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=1400%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-austin-Candidate-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77392\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9-700x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C878\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1123&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Former A.S. president Jimmy Villarreal, alongside the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department, launched an investigation into the claims but determined in late May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of IFC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler believes he might be the “shortest-term president” in A.S. history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we got a lot done, though,” he said in an interview on Monday. “I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler ran on four platform items last spring: launch an alternative transportation program for disabled students, reform campus sexual assault policy, push for the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) and make course readers more affordable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After several months, the alternative transportation program has become what is now Gaucho Rides, a pilot program that offers disabled students free rides to and from campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler, along with former senator Jerel Constantino, proposed the program approximately two years ago when he served in A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In April 2016, the two senators reached out to Lyft, a rideshare app that allows users to hail a taxi on demand, and were able to secure a partnership with the company. A month later, A.S. Senate passed a resolution to allocate $40,000 to the alternative transportation program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Applications opened for the first time in September to enroll 20 disabled students for free Lyft rides between home and campus. Hechler’s office named the program “Gaucho Rides.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The pilot program shut down in the third week of Winter Quarter, and the <i>Nexus</i> is currently verifying the causal factors. Meanwhile, Hechler said his office is developing a “backup plan” in which students can receive rides without the use of codes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of the A.S. President will most likely re-launch Gaucho Rides later this week, Hechler said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> in September that, depending on how the program ran in the next two quarters, he and other advocates would consider pushing for a lock-in fee for it. This week’s A.S. Elections ballot does not include such a measure.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s next platform item — sexual assault reform — has resurfaced intermittently throughout his political career.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The issue arose in April 2015 during an A.S. candidate forum when Hechler was running for a seat on A.S. Senate. An anonymous audience member asked the candidates how they plan to address campus sexual assault, and Hechler answered in response that he intended to extend sexual assault prevention training to the Greek community.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything,” he said in 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler incorporated the same policy into his platform when running for president last year, calling it “one of the bigger parts of [his] platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said on Monday that this year, he spearheaded a campaign to have fraternities and sororities learn how to prevent sexual assault through the Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program was funded by Hechler’s office and solicited approximately 120 men and women from IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alejandra Melgoza, who vied against Hechler in 2016, said she is yet to see Hechler involved in any of the monthly conversations with university administration concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said Hechler has not yet released a statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month or attended any events hosted by Take Back the Night, a student group dedicated to preventing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As President, he was also unable to keep his own senators who ran on a platform of sexual assault accountable,” Melgoza said in an email. “Sexual assault is not an issue that can be put on a platform to earn political capital. It affects many students personally, including myself.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said he has often sent representatives from his office to various meetings addressing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also promised in April 2016 to lead the push in A.S. for a CSD in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He and Ashcon Minoiefar, the A.S. external vice president of local affairs, worked closely together to gather volunteers for Yes on E&amp;F, a campaign which sought to establish the CSD through Measure E and fund the CSD with a special tax through Measure F.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As it turns out, voters in November overwhelmingly approved Measure E, thus creating the CSD, but did not pass Measure F, taking away the CSD’s main funding source.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fourth and final part of Hechler’s presidential campaign platform was to provide to students the least expensive course reader materials through a partnership with A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It was, like, a long process because at first we didn’t how to do it,” he said on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s office began work on this plan early on, sending out emails en masse to every professor at the university. The emails asked that faculty primarily use A.S. Publications instead of Alternative Digital Printing, the private printing business in the UCen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His office later opted to contact academic department heads instead. He said some departments, such as the political science and environmental studies departments, responded positively. Others did not reply at all, he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The goal at the end of the day was to create a bank through Pubs where, I guess, professors could upload their things and students wouldn’t even have to buy it. It would just be on the internet; you know, environmentally friendly,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said David Miller, the A.S. Publications staff member who died in March, told him that his office more than doubled the amount of course readers published through A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plan to increase student use of A.S. Publications “died out,” Hechler said, after Miller passed away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also took up a few other projects outside of his platform items, including an initiative to expand the A.S. Food Bank and a push to give priority registration to ROTC students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Breanna Jones, the A.S. Food Bank committee chair, told the <i>Nexus</i> in early April that Hechler advocated strongly to university administration for the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[He] really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened,” she said in April.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Senate passed a bill earlier this month to give priority registration to ROTC students, and the resolution now awaits approval from the Academic Senate. Senator Alex Giolito, who introduced the bill alongside senator Riley Hobson, said two weeks ago that Hechler “brought this all together by reaching out to ROTC students first.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This year I’ve really tried to hold the senators accountable in ways that I never thought I would have to,” Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Melgoza said she found Hechler’s platform items to be “inherently hollow” and “lacked substance,” saying he had “no personal connection to anything on his platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She added that she never viewed Hechler as “someone with conviction” when they both served on A.S. Senate, and she said her views have not changed since.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There were other senators who I definitely disagreed with at the table but I still admired their dedication to their beliefs,” Melgoza said in an email. “Hechler on the other hand was constantly passive.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Arielle Kronovet, Hechler’s chief of staff, said Hechler’s kindness can often be mistaken for passivity and that he is actually “firm to his beliefs.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s serious about leaving this school a better place, and I’ve seen him doing this throughout the year,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Talia Stringfellow, the A.S. president’s deputy chief of staff, said she found Hechler to be more decisive and communicative than his predecessor Villarreal, whom she worked for as an A.S. fellow the year before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sometimes [Villarreal] changed his mind and was not a big communicator,” she said. “Communication has been a huge, sweet [and] influential part of why I think Austin’s such a good president.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler will finish his term in the next few weeks, handing the presidency to whomever students elect Thursday night. In the meantime, Hechler said, he is applying for jobs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s funny because I bet everyone thinks, ‘Oh you have a nice title; you’re going to find a job easily.’ It’s not that easy. It’s really not,” he said. “Honestly I had no idea you had to apply to jobs so early.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler looks to receive his degree in political science in June. Wherever he ends up in the next few years, he said, he wants to continue in public service.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I really just want to give back to communities,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been so privileged to have so many great opportunities in my life, and I want to give that back to people wherever I am.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the

Fellowship Program and changing the dynamic of the senate through the implementation of i&gt;clickers in the voting process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said IVP is “kind of a silent, behind-the-scenes job” because the primary functions of the position are to run senate meetings, maintain the internal functions of the association and work on its own projects.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She is most proud of her work to expand the A.S. Fellowship, which allows students to become fellows to A.S. senators and executives and learn about the inner workings of the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, 100 students applied to be fellows and 66 were chosen. She added that many fellows are running for A.S. positions in this election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is what I wanted it to be,” Jordan said. “I wanted it to be somewhere people could actually learn about the internal functions of the association before diving into a role.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her campaign for IVP, Jordan stressed her interest in working with freshmen to increase their engagement with A.S. While she does not know how to gauge the effectiveness of her efforts, Jordan said she tabled in residence halls and reached out to freshmen in the Summer Start Program and during Week of Welcome. She hopes the work she did encouraged freshmen to join A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her time as IVP, Jordan was charged with leading senate meetings, which at times could become disorderly when senators disagreed on issues or when controversial topics were discussed at public forum.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, the senate moved its meeting into Corwin Pavilion from its normal Flying A Room in the UCen as it planned to vote on a resolution that would allow conservative orator Ben Shapiro to speak on campus. The meeting lasted six hours, and the senate voted to approve the resolution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, she was able to maintain a stable climate during the meeting because she established agreements and rules everyone had to adhere to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also said while public forums can cause tensions to run high and extend senate meetings, she thinks it is “really beautiful” when so many students come to voice their concerns to the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The biggest part about that is when someone comes to talk to the senators, I think as an exec or as a senator, people forget that these people are taking time out of their day-to-day schedules to come and speak,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Whatever they’re talking about is a part of their reality, so in a situation where a senate meeting goes for six hours, it’s not something people can see as something bad, but in reality more students are engaged in the issues,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nushi Yapabandara, a third-year philosophy major, ran against Jordan for IVP in the A.S. election last spring. She said she “commends” Jordan for the way she has handled the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara said she hopes next year’s IVP is “able to maintain the level of strictness and discipline and respect that Natalie has … made a standard in senate meetings.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said many unexpected projects arose during her term that were not on her campaign platform, including the creation of an A.S. orientation program, which acts as a guide to those first introduced to the association, as well as the projects that fellows in the fellowship program took on themselves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was most excited about the designation of an A.S. liaison from Counseling and Psychological Services to be available with students who work within A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, A.S. is a “lifestyle” and students make choices and sacrifices based on their involvement in the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of students, because of how taxing it can be, were experiencing a lot of mental health stresses,” Jordan said. “And I can totally understand that; I’ve been there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said the designated liaison has done group sessions with the senate, attends senate meetings and has been involved in the current elections by checking in with the candidates’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also reflected on the projects she hoped to do but was unable to complete, including bringing food trucks in the Arbor during finals week and using i&gt;clickers during senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, university administrations halted the plan for food trucks. She said when she realized her i&gt;clicker plan would not work, she altered the goal to eventually attain a more permanent space for senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVP said that at the beginning of her term, she was “so bad at delegating,” which posed a learning curve for her as she settled into IVP.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m kind of a controlling person and I want things to go my way … because I think sometimes I understand the greater picture, and it’s very naive of me to think that and I realize that,” Jordan said. “Sometimes I realize that instead of controlling a situation, it’s better to let others take a shot at it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara, who worked as Jordan’s director of programming during Fall Quarter, said she recognized Jordan’s struggle to give other staff members tasks as she “gunned through” and tried to do everything herself.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Yapabandara, this hindered Jordan’s ability to complete all the projects she wanted to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like she could have been a lot more transparent and accessible to everyone,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said that after her time as IVP, she has realized that the position is “experiential learning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No matter how much preparation you’ve had before or experience with this community, there’s really no way to learn how to manage an association of over 800 students overnight,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, the next elected IVP needs to focus on preserving a stable environment at senate meetings. She attributes her ability to handle the senate to the fact that she was an independent executive and “never had to play any games with anyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the next IVP needs to make sure they’re maintaining an unbiased viewpoint and also [make] sure that they’re really checking in with everyone and maintaining a really positive climate,” Jordan said. “You can only do so much, but trying at least matters.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As her time as IVP comes to an end and A.S. election season is almost over, Jordan said she loved the chance to be a “change-maker” in the association and now understands more about herself and her capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sleep is way overrated,” Jordan said. “Four hours a night is the slumber of champions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said after her term is complete, she will continue her position as vice president of the Isla Vista Community Service District as well as her full-time job as the senior event coordinator at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/","id":3955,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3954,3953,3952],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
