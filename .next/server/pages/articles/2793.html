<p>Candidates for the offices of Associated Students (A.S.) President, Internal Vice President, on-campus senator and university owned off-campus senator discussed key issues in an open forum Thursday afternoon at the Hub.</p>
<p>Prompted by questions texted in from the audience, the candidates discussed budget, police relations, sexual assault, mental health, I.V. self-governance and the A.S. senate resolution to divest from companies carrying out human rights violations in Israel-Palestine, which was voted down at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A.S. President</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third-year political science major and presidential candidate from Free Thinking Patriots (FTP) Jason Garshfield had the floor to himself during the presidential candidate forum due to his opponent, Jimmy Villarreal of the Open People’s Party (OPP), having a midterm scheduled during the forum.</p>
<p>Garshfield said he aims to represent unheard voices in the student body and cited voter apathy as evidence of voters feeling alienated from current A.S. leadership.</p>
<p>“I want to give students a voice that they haven’t been given, because I don’t believe that the current administration is adequately representing students at this university,” Garshfield said. “In the last election, only 37 percent of students voted … It only takes five minutes to vote on GOLD. So I think if 63 percent of students can’t be bothered to vote, there’s something wrong with the system. I aim to be a voice for that 63 percent of students.”</p>
<blockquote><p>The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom. That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board. – Candidate Jason Garshfield</p></blockquote>
<p>Garshfield said he believes current A.S. President Ali Guthy did not make a strong enough effort to be accessible to students.</p>
<p>“I think accessibility is a big problem and one of my criticisms of the current administration is a lack of accessibility because I think a lot of students probably don’t know who the A.S. president is,” Garshfield said. “I’d like to have events like pizza with the president … It’s a very easy problem when you’re behind a desk to forget who you’re representing.”</p>
<p>According to Garshfield, the police in Isla Vista should turn their focus away from “victimless crimes” and towards other crimes such as sexual assault and thefts.</p>
<p>“Police resources are scarce … I don’t want to decrease these resources, I want them to be used properly,” Garshfield said. “A 20-year-old having a beer at a party is not something police should be going after, somebody stumbling drunk down the street not doing harm to anyone else is not something police should be going after. All sorts of victimless crimes should be ignored,” Garshfield said. “The police in this town need to be focusing on real problems.”</p>
<p>On the topic of Assemblymember Das Williams’ state assembly bill (AB 3) to create a Community Services District as a solution to the call for increased self-governance in I.V., Garshfield said legislatures should instead be aiming for cityhood.</p>
<p>“I think that AB 3 doesn’t go far enough. I don’t believe in half measures in relation to cityhood and so I will not settle for a Community Services District, I will make sure that Isla Vista becomes a city,” Garshfield said.</p>
<p>When an audience member asked what Garshfield’s number one most important objective would be as president, Garshfield said he would promote freedom.</p>
<p>“The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom,” Garshfield said. “That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Internal Vice President</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third-year sociology major and On-Campus Senator representing OPP Kimia Hashemian and third-year chemistry and political science double major and current Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane running independently spoke about their goals and platforms for the position of Internal Vice President, an executive office primarily in charge of preceding over the A.S. Senate.</p>
<p>On whether or not senators should be allowed to cast secret ballots, Hashemian said the practice is acceptable under certain circumstances, citing death threats made against UC Irvine student government members who supported a bill to remove the United States flag from the student government lobby there.</p>
<p>“Senators need to be held accountable,” Hashemian said. “However if there is a topic where senators are threatened by students, like at UCI with the flag resolution, then I agree with a secret ballot because the safety of the senators is important to me and the most important aspect.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB. – Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane</p></blockquote>
<p>Goulhiane said he shares a similar opinion on that issue, arguing that an individual’s safety outweighs students’ need for transparency.</p>
<p>“It is really important to know how your representatives vote, but when it comes to circumstances in which people feel unsafe about voting because they believe certain people will be against them, I feel that since we are students, the safety of us and everyone else should be kept in mind,” Goulhiane said.</p>
<p>Goulhiane said his experience modifying the A.S. legal code to clarify the language makes him more qualified to manage internal senate issues.</p>
<p>“I personally was a part of the legal code reconstruction committee where we moved and around and switched ideas in sections and articles so that it all position duties would be in one area and not scattered all around. This will allow for future elected officials to know what they have to do and not have to waste a whole quarter trying to figure that out,” Goulhiane said.</p>
<p>But Hashemian also said also has experience making changes to the A.S. legal code, and plans to further educate senators on the code’s policies if elected.</p>
<p>“Last year I was an on-campus senator and we created the legal code that created the new structure of A.S.,” Hashemian said. “For next year, I plan on teaching senators what the A.S. legal code is and seeing what problems there are and what needs to be changed.”</p>
<p>Hashemian said if elected, she would emphasize encouraging students to be involved with A.S. using events such as a craft fair to get students excited about student government.</p>
<p>“Students pay $180 into A.S., but not everyone’s involved or excited to be involved,” Hashemian said. “I want to collaborate with students through my craft fair. I want to bring entrepreneurial students into A.S. This brings a whole new perspective into A.S.”</p>
<p>Goulhiane said he plans to reach out to younger students early in the school year to get more people working with A.S.</p>
<p>“I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB,” Goulhiane said.</p>
<p>Goulhiane said he plans to work to improve I.V.’s reputation, because the public tends to confuse I.V. with UCSB, leading students to take the blame for events that are out of their control.</p>
<p>“Making sure that Isla Vista gets fixed has been a huge priority for me and I’ve had the support of Chancellor Yang, the I.V. Foot Patrol and other entities to try and figure out a way to change Isla Vista’s image, because sadly, outside of UCSB, a lot of people see I.V. with a direct connection to UCSB and automatically assume that UCSB students are responsible for whatever takes place there,” Goulhiane said.</p>
<p>Hashemian said while working to keep Deltopia a safe event during the first weekend of April, she came to understand volunteering as a way to potentially improve I.V.’s reputation.</p>
<p>“Recently we have been building a better image in Isla Vista and I hope that we continue to do so. Recently during Deltopia I was part of a group called UCIV that passed out water to students and others and made sure that everyone stayed safe and out of trouble,” Hashemian said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Senators</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three candidates for on-campus senator and the single candidate for university owned off-campus senator discussed A.S. budget, residence halls, mental health, sexual assault and divestment during their forum. All four represent the Open People’s Party (OPP) and are running unopposed.</p>
<p>Regarding allocation of A.S.’s roughly $11 million dollar budget, third-year global studies major and University Owned Housing Senator candidate Joana Barrera said she wants to spend fees as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>“We plan to work as senators to distribute as much money as possible and not waste any money,” Barrera said. “It is important all fees are equally distributed.”</p>
<p>Barrea also said she would make A.S.’s budgetary decisions more transparent.</p>
<p>“We want to reach out to students and make sure they are knowledgeable about the fees and where their money is going,” Barrera said.</p>
<blockquote><p>A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways. – On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana</p></blockquote>
<p>First-year economics and political science double major and On-Campus Senator candidate Nawar Nemeh said he would make sure students starting official campus organizations understand how to access guaranteed funding.</p>
<p>“Finance and Business Committee currently has a rule that any organization in OSL or basically on campus the past two years gets $250 dollar start up fund that is always guaranteed,” Nemeh said. “I would want to expand that so anyone who wants to start a student group in OSL has the necessary funds to do so.”</p>
<p>First-year art history major and On-Campus Senator candidate Lacy Wright said she would focus on funding campus services.</p>
<p>“I would want to focus our student fees to services that students use, especially A.S. Program Board concerts, A.S. bike shop,” Wright said.</p>
<p>Wright said she also hopes to establish textbook banks in residence halls to save students’ money.</p>
<p>“For more popular classes, students can share textbooks and use them there,” Wright said. “Students can save on textbooks, which costs such a huge amount of money and can be a giant burden on students.”</p>
<p>First-year political science major and On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana said he has an idea for an app that would help students understand the A.S. budget.</p>
<p>“A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways,” Magana said. “One way I feel this would be innovative and relevant to our campus is creating an app that will let students know what was allocated to what.”</p>
<p>Nemeh says he will work with his constituents by attending residence hall council meeting.</p>
<p>“Increasing accessibility to A.S., I will attend hall councils on a weekly basis,” Nemeh said. “We plan to do that and engage and see what the students want.”</p>
<p>Barrera said her main goal will be expanding Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) beyond main campus.</p>
<p>“The one on campus is too far from students,” Barrera said. “I want to allocate funding for expanding those services.”</p>
<p>Wright also said she wants to expand the reach of CAPS.</p>
<p>“I want to add more mental health services to the outlying dormitory halls and resident apartments,” Wright said. “They are left unstaffed and it’s unacceptable. I will work to bring funding back to CAPS.”</p>
<p>Barrera said she will focus on resources for transfer students.</p>
<p>“I also want to start up transfer student center … and start an online forum for transfer students to share textbooks, share class schedules and become more united as a community,” Barrera said.</p>
<p>Nemeh said he would work to implement reports on campus energy efficiency.</p>
<p>“To publish a yearly energy efficiency report to see how UCSB gets its energy … and how we can move towards reducing reliance on nonrenewable energy and moving towards things like solar energy,” Nemeh said.</p>
<p>Magana said he would help other A.S. officers create temporary housing solutions to combat student houselessness.</p>
<p>“We want to find a way for the university to work on insuring international students or recently evicted students do not have to stay on the street or couch surf for a period of time,” Magana said. “The university can find some sort of amenity, maybe in the classrooms overnight for them to continue looking.”</p>
<p>Wright, a survivor of a sexual assault, said she wants to expand counseling services, specifically for other survivors.</p>
<p>“So something important to me is expanding resources for survivors, especially having enough counselors on hand to be able to work with survivors as well as making sure that they are trained specifically how to respond to sexual assault,” Wright said.</p>
<p>Magana said his main goal will be to improve campus mental health services.</p>
<p>“My main goal overall is working on mental health and diversifying it by getting more counselors that actively represent the student body as well as expanding these services to the residence halls,” Magna said.</p>
<p>Regarding divestment, Nemeh said each candidate’s position does not reflect OPP.</p>
<p>“I want to make it very clear that our opinions on these issues are ours and ours alone. The party does not take a stance on geopolitical issues,” Nemeh said.</p>
<p>Nemeh, who said he supports divestment, said he did not approve of senate’s use of secret ballots when voting on the proposed divestment resolution at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>
<p>“I think that is extremely unfair. I don’t think the senate should hide behind secret votes when making decisions that are so important to so many students on our campus.”</p>
<p>Wright said she chooses not to form an opinion because she represents a divided community of students.</p>
<p>“I believe my job, as a senator, is to represent the voices of the students,” Wright said. “Yesterday’s meeting has proven that the students are really divided, so I believe I can’t really make a stance on it if I can’t fully represent the voices of the students.”</p>

And I’ll take those Wrangler jeans while I’m at it, too. He grasped our attention and support when he led them to an 8-3 record, and earned our empathy when they sputtered out in the end.

And then he retired again, only to come back to the team with maybe two minutes left on the clock in the 2010 training camp. Cool, Favre. Way to cop out big time.

America can accept an aging star losing his abilities to Father Time. However, you begin to lose us at “scandal” or “extramarital affair.” Indeed, I always try to separate the player from the person. In this case, however, I can’t overlook how selfish and egotistical he has become during his post-Packers era. If the allegations that he sent those yuck pictures to the Jets employee are true, then he, as well as his reputation, is worse off than I thought.

Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the divestment resolution’s reference to similarities between South Africa under apartheid and the state of Israel today are outlandish and unfairly target the Jewish community on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The divestment resolution creates a framework that alienates Jewish students at UCSB, in part because it establishes a clear link to the BDS movement,” Moreh said. “Moreover, the attempt to draw parallels between Israel and South Africa under apartheid is ignorant and offensive on many levels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreh said expressing opposition to the resolution doesn’t equate to support for denying Palestinians of basic human rights and that the resolution advocated for ending the Jewish state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rejecting this resolution does not mean opposing the rights of Palestinians; it means refusing to accept an agenda, promoted by this resolution; that the only way in which UCSB students can support Palestinians is by tearing down Jews and Israel, and by ultimately making the Jewish people stateless,” Moreh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreh said a more productive resolution would be one that would address concerns of both Palestinians and Israelis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In order to constructively address the hardships that both Palestinians and Israelis face, a significantly better alternative would be to write an entirely new resolution based on mutual recognition and respect,” Moreh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-year anthropology and global studies double major and Student President of Hillel Sarah Tagger said the resolution seeks to “undermine the self-determination of Jewish people in the region.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It targets the only Jewish state in the world,” Tagger said. “The BDS movement that it is founded upon is based in anti-Semitic values and rhetoric and the movement does not look for ways to make peace between two groups — it actually just detracts from that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTagger said evidence that divestment encourages anti-Semitism can be seen on other campuses that have passed divestment resolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At UC Davis, the night after divestment was passed, the AD Phi woke up to swastikas spray-painted on their house,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a meeting on April 1, the A.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution to condemn anti-Semitism. Tagger said the anti-Semitism resolution was an important measure to take prior to the debate on the divestment resolution that had “been a long time coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been working and striving towards coming up with something that we can bring up to Senate to showcase all the anti-Semitism that happens on campus that people don’t know about,” Tagger said. “I actually had a lot of people at the meeting tell me, ‘oh I didn’t realize so much anti-Semitism was occurring on campus.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTagger said she wants people to be more attuned to the Jewish community’s interpretation of divestment and its impact on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just think it’s important for people to know that if our community sees this resolution as anti-Semitic that we should be listened to,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExecutive Director for Santa Barbara Hillel Rabbi Evan Goodman said there was a stark contrast between the anti-divestment camp and divestment proponents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The premise of BDS is, one of their tenants is anti-normalization. They actively do not want to have discussions with people with a different opinion, they actively do not want to have discussions with people who support Israel’s right to exist in safe and secure boundaries as a Jewish State,” Goodman said. “We’re the opposite of that and we want to have discussions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodman also said he did not believe claims from members of SJP and A.S. Senators that the divestment resolution was unrelated to Judaism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When people say ‘Well, it’s not about being Jewish,’ it is about being Jewish and ultimately it’s so destructive to the multi-ethnic fabric of our campus communities, it’s a horrible, horrible situation and it’s not doing anyone any good on any of our campuses,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodman said he had received numerous calls from concerned parents of Jewish students asking about the divestment resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re hearing from their kids on campus how terribly upset they are,” Goodman said. “Many of these people are not people that have had any Israel activism before; they’re Jewish. So again this goes against anyone who says it’s not about being Jewish. From a Jewish perspective it’s absolutely about being Jewish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiddle Eastern studies professor Adam Sabra said the conflict stems in part from the growth of nationalism in Europe over one hundred years ago. Sabra said the rise of anti-semitism in Europe alongside nationalism facilitated interest among European Jews to establish a Jewish state for themselves, with the Palestine region considered a primary option. Sabra also said the decline of the Ottoman Empire and rise of Arab nationalism in the late 19th century also facilitated interest in an Arab state in what by 1922 was the British-controlled “Mandate of Palestine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The conflicts between the Zionist movement and the Palestinian nationalist movement really goes back to the late 19th century, early 20th century,” Sabra said. “A key moment in this was the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Britain was at war with the Ottoman Empire and ultimately captured Palestine … and in response to request from British Jews who were supporters of the Zionist movement, the British issued a statement saying there should be a Jewish national home in Palestine, they didn’t say state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Balfour Declaration specifically stated the government of the United Kingdom did not wish to see inequality perpetuated in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object,” the declaration reads. “It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, tension grew between Arab communities and Jewish communities in the post-World War I international situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This started a situation that grew worse after the end of the war,” Sabra said. “A lot of immigration by Jews from Europe to Palestine was being pushed by flight from … persecution. At the same time, the Palestinian Arabs also were saying the possibility that they would have some kind of Arab state … this led increasingly to intercommunal tension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra also said the establishment of the state of Israel led to further tension among Arabs and Jews in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think the Palestinians had a problem with Jews as such being citizens in their state; Jews were citizens in other Arab states in much larger numbers in those days,” Sabra said. “That changed after the foundation of the state of Israel in the Arab-Israeli wars. … It wasn’t the presence of Jews that was the issue, it was the attempt to shift the demographic mix and to establish specifically a Jewish state that the Arabs felt they would have no place in this and would be second-class citizens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra said the 1948 Arab-Israeli War involved mass emigration of 90 percent, or roughly 700,000 people according to the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, of the Arab population in Palestine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is debate about how this actually took place, but it’s pretty clear that in some places they were actually driven out, other places they fled the fighting,” Sabra said. “The Israelis made the clear decision not to allow them to ever come back. These are the people who became the Palestinian refugees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, according to Sabra, the Israelis granted Jews all over the world the right to come to Israel, called the right of return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can see this as a matter of providing Jews a last refuge, but it was also effectively a matter of demographic policy, because without the Jewish population elsewhere, they would not be able to build a Jewish state,” Sabra said. “If they allowed the Arab citizens … to return home, they also would not get a Jewish state. So Israel was founded basically on ethnic cleansing. There’s really not much doubt about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.S. resolution articulated support for a right of return for Palestinian refugees to the modern state of Israel, which Tagger said is anti-Semitic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they were all to return to the Jewish state it would extinguish the Jewish state as we know it and Jews would become the minority in their homeland,” Tagger said. “The right of return is as something that is part of the BDS movement [and] is in the larger framework of anti-Semitism by telling Jews they can’t be where they have historically been as an indigenous people for 3,000 years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern Middle East history professor Sherene Seikaly said the Israel-Palestine conflict is primarily centered on territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The conflict in Israel-Palestine is a conflict over land; it isn’t a 2,000 year old conflict, it isn’t some struggle from time immemorial,” Seikaly said. “For centuries, people of multiple faiths in the Arab World and under Ottoman and before that under Islam lived and co-existed … until the 12th century, 90 percent of the world’s Jewish population lived under Arab and Muslim rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeikaly also said it is only with the rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism that the categories of “Arab and Jew” become mutually exclusive, a product of “contemporary nationalism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think nationalism promises everybody equality,” Seikaly said. “But the way that it promises everybody equality is that we all have to be the same in a sense … There is a way historically throughout many examples that the nation state has necessitated exclusionary and violent practices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeikaly said such practices occurring alongside the formation of nation-states are difficult at embracing difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it inevitable that nationalism is violent or … is there a way that one could have a nation state that wouldn’t be violent? I don’t know,” Seikaly said. “I think a process that is built on the foundation that there is some kind of natural ‘link’ between all of a certain group of people … I feel like that kind of project is going to be very difficult to be embracing difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra said the founding of Israel was based in part off the denial of certain rights, including equal access to education and housing; to others as a matter of policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When they talk about founding a Jewish state, it was not to found a state necessarily that was Jewish religion-predominated, it was to found a state which was by and for Jews which offered Jews a different set of rights than offered others,” Sabra said. “It’s a policy. Israel is a Jewish state and therefore Jews have different rights than other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, adherence to such policy is not unified among all constituencies in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always been this tension in Israel between more liberal tendencies that wanna say, ‘Well, okay we’re not gonna go back and reverse the conflict but at least the people who are still here should be equal citizens,’” Sabra said. “But increasingly that’s not the case anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, the Likud Party, the current ruling party of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, wish to pass a law defining Israel constitutionally as a Jewish state to prevent the Israeli Supreme Court from finding non-Jewish citizens are entitled to legal equality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The direction of politics these days is away from any kind of equality … it’s an ethnocracy,” he said. “It would be like if we said, ‘Well, America is a white state and black people can live here; they shouldn’t expect to go to the same schools, they shouldn’t expect to live in the same neighborhoods, they shouldn’t expect equality in the courts. We don’t owe that to them.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakamura spoke on how his research in developing blue LEDs has allowed lighting technology, among other things, to become much more efficient and environmentally friendly. Nakamura began studying LEDs when researching and publishing papers on the scarcely studied compound GaN for his Ph.D. and eventually invented the blue LED and white LED in 1993.

His hire was like mounting the jewel in the semiconductor crown at UC Santa Barbara.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYang said he thinks Nakamura’s LED will one day replace Thomas Edison’s lightbulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are all here to witness first-hand the brilliance of professor Shuji Nakamura and his blue LED,” Yang said. “He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakamura began his talk with the history of LED lighting, from growing high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) crystals in 1991, to developing blue LEDs in 1994 and up to the present. The revolution in generating white light, achieved by combining blue light with a yellow phosphor, enables energy-efficient lighting, displays, medicine and the next generation of Blu-ray optical storage, according to Nakamura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_62888\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62888\" data-attachment-id=\"62888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/shujinakamura_mclane-brown-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL SL1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430250533\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ShujiNakamura_McLane Brown-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2-167x250.jpg?resize=254%2C380\" alt=\"McLane Brown/Daily Nexus\" width=\"254\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?w=400\u0026amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-62888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eMcLane Brown/Daily Nexus\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To make the white color, you get the blue color and the yellow color and they make white.
