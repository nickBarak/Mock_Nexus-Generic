Somehow, Lotus creates music that perfectly encapsulates this abstract image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album kicks off with “Heroes”, an epic, fast-tempoed opener that feels both airy and frantic. This theme continues throughout the first half of the album with most songs sounding like a score to a movie placed in outer space.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the sixth track on the album for example, “Burning Down the House”, which features legendary P-Funk singer and songwriter George Clinton. Lotus matches spacey synths with a swaggering bassline reminiscent of early Dr. Dre, creating the perfect atmosphere for Clinton to eerily croon, “I know something that they don’t know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of basslines, Lotus once again leaned on the work of longtime friend and collaborator Thundercat to craft about 90% of the bass on the record and, per usual, the duo clearly displayed their trademarked chemistry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, a time when artists have seemingly abandoned attempts at long albums, the 27-song, 67-minute project appears almost overwhelming to listen to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flamagra </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is perhaps intentionally disorienting, the pacing of the album suffers at points. After the aforementioned song “Burning Down the House,” the album lulls because of four consecutive tracks that fail to advance the mood or theme of the album in any significant way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the album comes roaring to life again with the eleventh track “Yellow Belly”,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">featuring breakout rapper Tierra Whack. Over an incredibly minimalist beat, Whack’s feature is downright hilarious. At one point Whack raps, “He’s got titties in his face” in four completely different voices. It may sound unorthodox, but Whack’s raw charisma is what carries this track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately after this sonic detour, Denzel Curry spits a verse that proves he is an up-and-coming talent in rap on “Black Balloons Reprise”. Despite FlyLo crafting a more orthodox beat for Curry, the haunting overtones of the composition once again foster a lingering sense of paranoia in the listener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the album approaches the end, Lotus swaps out this feeling of paranoia with a much sweeter, more nostalgic sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “Debbie is Depressed,” Lotus somehow merges what sounds like a mid-2000s  Clipse beat with a smooth vocal sample that states, “All the days just feel the same.” At its best, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flamagra</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> creates haunting, yet touching moods that few artists dare try to encapsulate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another standout, “The Climb,” Thundercat adds his own high-pitched vocals to the track. Over a warm instrumental, Thundercat’s voice sounds perfectly at home — a comforting presence in what is, more often than not, a disorienting album.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large part, FlyLo centers this part of the album around the passing of his dear friend Mac Miller. In fact, the second to last track, “Thank U Malcolm,” is a heartfelt tribute to Miller, with swelling strings and an electric guitar riff that allows the listener to feel the impact that Miller had on FlyLo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FlyLo has delivered one of the most unique and nuanced albums in recent memory, but it still suffers from a few shortcomings. The album can be slow at times toward the middle — perhaps Lotus might have benefited from cutting a few songs from the album.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while the album features some excellent guest performances, none rival the performance of Lamar on “Never Catch Me.”  On lead single “More,” Anderson .Paak comes closest to hitting this high, thanks in large part to the booming beat Lotus laces for him. Unfortunately, .Paak’s rapping has never been his strongest suit, and his cadence has once again left something to be desired on the track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of these flaws,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Flamagra</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘s proven that Flying Lotus is a singular talent — one who can seemingly capture any mood in his music.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Artists like Pharrell Williams, for example, who seem to have production credits and contributions all over in pop culture, are rarely cited for their actual solo work, becoming (unfairly) more of an image than a powerful solo musician. Toro Y Moi has often been placed into this strange and often inaccurate box of music culture; he’s been seemingly everywhere across genre and style and influence. Any music fan can recognize his face and fashion, yet strangely enough, he is not praised for his music to the same degree that he should be. Despite all of this, Chaz Bear, more frequently known as Toro Y Moi, proves through his live presence and energy that he is a great performer despite these constraints, standing alone as not only an iconic image but also a major influence and pioneer of 21st century indie music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi hit downtown Santa Barbara’s SOhO last Thursday for a stop on his tour following his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album release and after announcing a new album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Peace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is coming early 2019. With a long, successful career and a ton of commercial buzz, Chaz beautifully arrived on stage, maintaining a delicate balance of high energy and chill waves and prompting one of the danciest crowds I’ve ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaz began his set with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album opener “Mirage,” which was met with a strong response from the audience. The energy didn’t reach full potential, however, until he performed his new single, “Freelance,” soon after, which seemed to be the true start of the night. Toro himself was alternating between keys, a beat pad and solo vocals, meshing seamlessly with his incredibly rehearsed backing band. Sonically, things were just about perfect, with the vocal reverb balanced exactly as it is on record and instrumentation that was clean and vibrant.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

This moment in particular marked some of the highest audience involvement, with nearly everyone singing along to the catchy hook and dancing with the grooves. Despite the electronic-heavy landscape of “Boo Boo,” the live setting translated alarmingly well, with every 808 drum, groovy baseline and synth chord hitting hard and true. Much of the magic that Chaz Bear presents here lies in turning his recorded dreams into a live reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In person, Toro Y Moi was about as quaint and down-to-earth as I had imagined. He was a man of few words between songs and seemed to say more in performance than anything else. His movement and engagement were limited, yet effective, which made for a very intimate and immersive show. This mysterious and somewhat reclusive element of Toro is a bit of a staple of his image, and it proved extremely effective once paired with the strong backing band and lighting choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the more exciting moments mid-set came from Toro’s early classic album, 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of these deeper cuts worked as a nod to his more dedicated fans and provided a change of pace from the other tracks in the set. Moving emotional tracks like “Say That” and “So Many Details” were memorable moments at SOhO, and they personally took me back to my high school days when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was first released. Toro Y Moi wrapped up his set with classic hit “Rose Quartz,” a track that is lodged in the memory of any true fan of Chaz’s music and one that marked the start of a huge career. The performance was extremely powerful in its nostalgic nature and celebratory tone, ending the night where a lot of Toro’s fans began with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi is a total icon, not only in image and cultural positioning but also in diverse musicianship, intimate performative value and sheer, raw talent. If a look into his discography doesn’t prove this, surely some time in his live setting will. After an incredibly fun and ultimately moving night at SOhO, I can assure you that Toro Y Moi isn’t going anywhere but forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Co-op garage. A few couches accommodate hushed conversations amongst those already there, and any newcomer’s pre-existing social anxiety dissolves into the dim lights and welcoming energy. Some people have never been here before, but the Biko House has a way of making them feel right at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranging from experimental folk to gothic electronica, an array of local and touring talent showcased their music at the Biko House in an event organized by Funzone on Oct. 17. This recurring DIY event operates under the mission of providing an accessible, diverse and substance-free music community to the Santa Barbara area.

Carrying her talent across the West Coast on tour, her multi-instrumental sound encouraged exploration of the unconscious mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is definitely one of my favorite venues I’ve played at so far on the tour,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deli Nebletts said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I loved most about Biko was that it felt like a safe space and everyone was really welcoming, which makes the world of a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Biko House is one of five student housing Co-ops in Isla Vista that stresses the importance of inclusion while supporting a community free of discrimination. The garage space in particular functions as an all-purpose space for the community, hosting events such as art exhibitions and small concerts. The environment not only attracts performers and attendees alike, but is highly valued by those who live there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the best thing I’ve ever been apart of at UCSB and I wish I had lived at Biko last year, too,” fourth-year philosophy major Isabella D’Alessandro said. “It’s cool because things like this are so accessible, they’ve definitely been a highlight of my time here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event wouldn’t have been possible, however, without the help of Funzone. Once a location in downtown Santa Barbara, Funzone now operates through Facebook as a key organizational element for booking shows in the area. Working with radio station KCSB to promote events such as these, they are able to foster a space of music for all ages and give underheard bands a platform for exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only for high school students, but even at UCSB there are a lot of kids that are under 21 that can’t go to half of what happens downtown,” Spencer Von Hershman, Santa Barbara resident and creator of Funzone, said. “It’s a nice other option for people who don’t want to party all the time, or simply aren’t interested in partying at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing an environment that unifies similar-minded people with something that they are passionate about is the ultimate goal of performances like Wednesday evening’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just a safe place to mess around, no one here is judgemental. People want to hang out with nice people who are here to enjoy themselves and be respectful,” Von Hershman said. “Santa Barbara is a really good community for that.”</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewind to 2012: You see a crew of mischievous young rappers being followed around by teenagers in skate merch decorated with kittens, upside-down crosses and sprinkled donuts. This was all led by one tall, gap-toothed and loud individual who goes by the name of Tyler, the Creator. Combine this with a bunch of debauchery and banter from elderly folks claiming that their kids are being brainwashed, and you’ve got yourself a group called Odd Future. On the cusp of their infamy, they decided to take on a ridiculous festival that has come to be known as Camp Flog Gnaw. On the seventh year of its illustrious run, Tyler has taken the monumental Dodger Stadium and transformed it into a ballpark for misfits with a stacked lineup of prominent artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-day festival first emerged in the form of a carnival, established by the noteworthy ferris wheel overlooking Los Angeles.The foundation of the carnival is the youth who have loved Tyler’s outlandish approach to the music world and fashion and have stuck around to build an empire with the most diverse fanbase up to date. The dark night was filled with bodies wandering through the ballpark covered by sprinkles of ash from the forest fires and cradled by the eccentric music that pounded from bass-heavy speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the “Camp” and “Flog” stages provided lethal performances from impressive artists ranging from the likes of young Indie icons Rex Orange County and hypebeast phenomenon Playboi Carti to boy band Brockhampton, while the “Gnaw” stage had significantly lower numbers in comparison. Despite the terrible air conditions, attendees shined in fluorescent outfits to scounder through the new venue in search of the best way to get the most out of the first of the two-day festival. The stadium was perfectly designed with beautiful flower patterns; deep-fried food scents lingered throughout, and people lined up for classic “Adventureland”-esque ring tossing games. Ultimately, everyone found solace in jumping in or sitting around crowds to enjoy the music. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowds moshed heavily during sets like that of Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti. His sticky ad-libs and braggadocious lyricism, combined with toxic instrumentals, unleashed savage behavior and raised everyone’s adrenaline to a maximum capacity. Meanwhile, Indie-heads simultaneously danced passionately on the opposite end of the venue to Rex Orange County tracks like “Loving Is Easy” and helped further establish how the festival is far from being filled with unidimensional music enthusiasts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kali Uchis took her sensuality to the stage to put on a stellar performance with guitar solos and a guest appearance from The Internet’s Steve Lacy — who also performed earlier in the day — for standout track “Your Teeth In My Neck.” After a passionate performance from the Flog Gnaw founder himself, Tyler, the Creator, during which he channeled a variety of faces to help sing along to tracks that ranged from “Goblin” to “Flower Boy” and at least one track from everything in between, the night capped off with a ruthless performance from the unapologetic “G.O.O.D Music” rapper Pusha T. The infamous rapper put on a pure, captivating performance, creating a diverse setlist with his latest fully Kanye West-produced project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daytona, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and songs from 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Name Is My Name</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pusha took the atmosphere to the next degree with live installments of Clipse track “Grindin’ ” and even his Kanye West collab “New God Flow” to close out the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before it even began, day two of the festival had established itself as legendary simply based off of the lineup of musical enigmas like Ms. Lauryn Hill and the Kid Cudi/Kanye West duo, Kids See Ghosts. Early on, people stood in enormous lines for the overpriced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids See Ghosts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merchandise and Camp Flog Gnaw memorabilia. Nevertheless, sets from Taco and even Jaden Smith made for a perfect ending to fans’ anticipations. Taco enthralled the audience with the furious pounding from his trap-heavy DJ set, and Smith’s enthusiasm kept the environment lively. Soon enough, class was in session as Ms. Lauryn Hill took the stage and entranced the crowd with beautiful ballads from her iconic debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
