I was immediately greeted with a spotlight glare glinting off of some guy’s grills. The club was packed and the dance floor was bumping with classic R&amp;B. I was surrounded by hardened reps from about a dozen different entertainment companies and enough ice to supply the props for “Blood Diamond.” To even further add to the intense atmosphere of the place, half of the girls in the club were wearing Jason masks repping their favorite groups.</p>\n<p>I soon discovered why the crowd was so intense — half of them were opening acts. The DJ stopped spinning and the first group took the stage. From what I could tell their name was “One Hitter Quitter Dome Splitter,” but that very well could have been a line of weed products they were promoting. This theory was bolstered by the fact that their front man was essentially a carbon copy of Jesse Pinkman.</p>\n<p>Regrettably I couldn’t keep track of the rest of the openers’ names, partially because they were all pretty fucked up and partially because there were <em>eight</em> of them. The crowd grew as tired as I did, and by the fifth act most of them had retreated to the bar to save their strength for Kurupt.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally at about 10:30 p.m., the DJs stepped back and Kurupt emerged from the back room with an entourage of about 20. The crowd absolutely lost their heads when the party came out, mostly because Young Gotti’s entourage included Death Row legends (and fellow Dogg Pound members) Daz Dillinger and RBX. After the party took the stage, Kurupt immediately began spitting fire. He performed a mix of his older G-Funk material and his more recent stuff, and did so with the deliverance of a howitzer cannon. He was joined alternatingly by Daz and RBX, and the chemistry between them all was immediately apparent. These are rappers whose relationships to one another as performers and artists had been hardened by two decades in the game together.</p>\n<p>Up-and-coming R&amp;B singer Shantay joined the fray partway through the show, and her soulful, striking voice completely cut through the grumble of the crowd. The ladies in the club perked up noticeably, as they finally got the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrMrqBcv6Mk\">slow jamz</a> they were looking for. Towards the end, the reason for the unconventional show structure and the onslaught of opening acts became clear — I was at someone’s birthday party! The man’s name was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidorosco805\">David Orosco</a>, and I guess he’s one of the owners of the Ventura-based merch company <a href=\"http://cuzzaloink.com/\">Cuzzalo Ink</a>. They’re in the business of making custom masks for hip hop artists and the like, so that explained the masquerade vibes I was getting from the crowd. David was up onstage chilling with Young Gotti and they were all passing around blunts and forties, so it seems like he got the old-fashioned gangsta party he was looking for.</p>\n<p>Before signing off for the night, Kurupt and Daz finally donned the blank white T-shirts of Tha Dogg Pound. They finished off their set with two of DPG’s best songs from back in the day: “New York, New York” and “What Would U Do.” These songs hit the crowd just as hard as they hit mid-‘90s L.A., and in those moments the word “bumpin’” was redefined. Every single person in the house knew the lyrics, and you’d be hard-pressed not to find someone with at least one hand in the air. This definitely hyped up the crowd for Tha Dogg Pound’s announcement at the show’s conclusion that they are coming back for another album.</p>\n<p>After the show, the trio held a meet-and-greet backstage for people with special VIP tickets. I didn’t have one of those, but I managed to get backstage courtesy of one of the club’s promoters, Chase. I’d been in the back room all of two seconds when some dude grabbed me by the shoulder, said, “Yo, you’re next” and shoved me up onto a platform with a wall of cameras to my back and three hip hop legends (and personal friends of Tupac Shakur holy shit) in front of me. My mouth made a bunch of weird, soundless shapes instead of the words I was looking for, but I managed to dap each of them while my brain got its shit together. As I turned around to make a presumably dumb-looking face for the cameras, I managed to sputter out a request for a quote about the show.</p>\n<p>“One hunded.”</p>\n<p>And that’s all she wrote.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU5EUAh8q34</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Newsom’s latest triumph, <em>Divers</em>, has secured its role as one of the best female alternative albums of the year. 17 years prior, a relatively similar album captured the hearts of many: Cat Power’s magnum opus, <em>Moon Pix</em>.<em> Divers </em>and <em>Moon Pix </em>share the same haunting female vocals set to a textured, string-based backdrop. Both albums’ artists were even dating the same fantastically lucky boyfriend near the time of release. Where the two albums differ vastly is in their tone. Newsom offers a bouncy, vivified sound throughout most of the album — the style you’d expect from a soprano harpist. Conversely, Power chills the soul with a melancholy slew of distorted guitar and earnest, occasionally nonsensical lyrics. No matter your preference between the two, Cat Power paved the way for artists like Newsom, and <em>Moon Pix </em>has gone down in history as one of the best alternative rock albums of the ‘90s.</p>\n<p>The album begins harshly with “American Flag,” which unexpectedly borrows a backwards, slowed-down beat from The Beastie Boys’ “Paul Revere.” The album then dives right into “Back Of Your Head,” a song that sets the tone for the rest of the album. This song, along with many others on the album, illustrates Power’s sincere frustrations with her many inner demons, of which she has no shortage.</p>\n<p>The emotional steamroller that is Cat Power, birth name Chan Marshall, was the prophetic product of her upbringing. Growing up surrounded by alcoholism in a broken, musically-inclined home, Power was destined to join the ranks of other “tortured” artists. Doing just that, the name Cat Power has since become synonymous with a bar-to-bar lifestyle (she literally has a song titled “Lived in Bars”) and nuclear-level meltdowns, both on and off stage. In fact, the majority of <em>Moon Pix</em> was written during perhaps one of her worst meltdowns, “in one deranged night.” To quote from her biography:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The earth started shaking, and dark spirits were smashing up against every window of my house. I woke up and I had my kitten next to me … and I started praying to God to help me … So I just ran and got my guitar because I was trying to distract myself. I had to turn on the lights and sing to God. I got a tape recorder and recorded the next sixty minutes. And I played these long changes, into six different songs. That’s where I got the record.”</p>\n<p>The album reaches its apex with “Metal Heart,” one of the songs written during this hallucination. The song is a cathartic embodiment of escaping depression backed by a tastefully disorganized cascade of steel-stringed distortion. Power comes out quickly with the line “You’re losing the calling that you’ve been faking” and ends with “Metal heart, you’re not worth a thing.” Power refers to her trouble overcoming her inhibitions, but, inspirationally, putting out this song is in itself doing just that.</p>\n<p><em>Moon Pix</em> is an album driven more by raw emotion and less by technical, musical talent. Power, an outspoken disbeliever in the necessity of formal music training, has snuck her way into the music community through pouring herself completely into what she creates. The caliber of her work is based solely on her emotional energy, so upon making a masterpiece like this album, ensuing meltdowns are to be expected. <em>Moon Pix </em>is Cat Power’s manifestation of her fragile, fuck-the-man persona and a testament to the wide emotional range that so few can honestly convey.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67310\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-12/cat-powers-moon-pix/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67310\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-12/cat-powers-moon-pix/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-12/cat-powers-moon-pix/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-12/cat-powers-moon-pix/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-12/cat-powers-moon-pix/","id":6839,"author":{"id":722,"name":"Thomas Mannell"},"related":[6838,6837,6836],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"FMLYBND’s ‘Hearts On Fire’ In Review","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0753.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0753.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This Friday, FMLYBND is set to release their highly anticipated new EP, Hearts on Fire.

Quick, driving synths, big bass, flying vocals and a powerfully catchy chorus make it easy to picture blasting through the speakers of a classic I.V. house party, complete with the trademark undulating crowd of teens and twenty-somethings singing and casually spilling their half-full red cups on one-another.</p>\n<p>“Space and Time” follows, complete with FMLYBND’s signature style of unforgettable synth hook, huge drops, easily-recognizable and quickly-learnable vocals and a layer of summery guitar on top. A definite mood booster to shout out the windows on the next drive down the 101.</p>\n<p>Montgomery describes the title track “Hearts on Fire,” as “passionate” and “anthemic.” Once again, a catchy synth and drum intro lead to initially calm, ultimately rising vocals by Montgomery and fellow FMLYBND vocalist Braelyn Montgomery. A simple, but incredibly fun chorus makes this song accessible for the dedicated listeners and casual partiers, alike.</p>\n<p>The penultimate “Phoenix,” signals a shift from the upbeat, poppy trio that composes the first songs. It opens with some heavy, slightly grungy electrics and moves into a synthesizer riff that moves all over the board, with airy vocals and pained lyrics that almost deceive the listener into thinking this song has dark heart. But FMLYBND’s relentless energy makes even this, the least ‘happy’ song on the EP, a song of energetic redemption.</p>\n<p>According to Montgomery, the final track on the EP, “Land of the Rising Sun,” is about the Isla Vista mass murder of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>“That one is pretty much dedicated to the family and friends of the victims,” Montgomery said. “The chorus is pretty much an encouragement … ‘When you feel like you can’t go on, all you think about is how they’re gone. Someday we’ll see them in the land of the rising sun.’ Which is a place of hope.”</p>\n<p>This last song, despite the emotionally challenging content, uses gentle, ambient vibes, a light drumbeat and Montgomery’s passionate vocals to maintain a sense of positivity and peace. The track, and thus the EP, ends with soaring vocals that leave you feeling satisfied and optimistic, but still yearning for the next album… or maybe just a replay.</p>\n<p>Despite clocking in just under 20 minutes, <em>Hearts On Fire</em> is anything but short of expectations. Everything from the short fills to the precise synthesizer work is a result of the band’s intentionality. A start-to-finish run through is the best way to understand the journey that this collection represents for the band.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a reflection of my life … so it’s kind of letting people into that experience of watching best friends not become best friends, seeing people die,” the lead guitarist said. “It’s heavy, in this beautiful paradise there’s all this crazy stuff that can go down. It’s figuring out how to be the best person you can be, figuring out how to love people, how to love yourself”</p>\n<p>Despite the depth of the music, it’s not meant to be too heavy, rather it’s something to help people come to terms with the struggle of humanity, to celebrate life and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>“It’s this whole love, mixed with pain, and at the end kind of very triumphant. It’s happy, it’s love, dark, sad, hopeful,” Montgomery said. “It’s not a depressing EP, it’s not a happy EP. It’s all over the place. But it flows as one.”</p>\n<p>After the launch of this EP, FMLYBND is set to start working on their first full length album. “We want everything to be out of the box, meaning nothing is made on the computer. Not a synth not a drum,” Montgomery said. “I wasn’t everything to be 100 percent real. Like we tracked it. Epic. Like the sickest synth patches you’ve never heard because we made them on this analogue synth.”</p>\n<p>Until the next release, keep your peeled in IV. FMLYBND is just waiting for an open front yard on DP, but stay tuned because you’re not going to hear about it until you hear it blasting through the streets.</p>\n<p>FMLYBND will be having their EP launch party on January 23<sup>rd</sup> at Velvet Jones.

bus headed downtown to see Shiba San light up SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club. Lined with kitschy Christmas lights and rows of sloshed Greeks, the bus made its bass-bumping trek along the 101.</p>\n<p>In the clump of a line clustered around the venue’s entrance, Cal Poly third year Maria Roberts remarked on the blockbusting French DJ she’d traveled miles just to see again. “Shiba San took me back to — whaddya call it with the dinosaurs? — the Jurassic era,” she said. “I felt like I was riding a T. rex the whole time.”</p>\n<p>By the time we got to the front and our names were sharpied off the list, we were ready for the dinosaur ride of our lives. The second opener, local DJ Future Relic, took the stage as we entered the club’s bustling dance floor. Geometric lights flanked the stage as Relic span his engaging set of dance-friendly beats. He showed a real penchant for matching the vibe of the crowd in his seamless transitions and creative sampling, including in his mix snippets from the best video on the internet, GI Joe PSAs. The only concern the audience had during his set was whether or not they’d conserved enough energy for the main act.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Shiba took the stage he kept the ball right on rolling. The little time between the sets ensured that the lively audience had no time to cool off, and Shiba’s massive beats had enough gravity to draw in the minglers around the bar and patio. Under the exposed vents and beams of SOhO’S contemporarily rustic roof, hands wristbanded and X-marked alike waved through the air, all spangled with hundreds of glowing green dots from the fragmenting laser hung up above stage.</p>\n<p>Shiba augmented his tailbone-vibrating basslines with goofy, looping, animal-themed visuals befitting of his canine persona. Floating cat heads swallowed up and regurgitated smaller versions of themselves and a party-ready zebra rocked a pair of wayfarers as it jumped around on the screens. The animal motif was appropriate; the floor became a site of primate flow and energy. The mark of any good live musician is their ability to aid their audience in the disposal of inhibitions. Shiba did this easily, a pied piper leading his fans through the groove.</p>\n<p>His pull on his crowd was strong enough to get an ample amount of them to hop up onto stage with him. Concertgoers decked out in flashy sequined tops and cropped denim playfully shook their stuff in orbit around the DJ, some nervously approaching him to venture a chat. Nothing could pierce Shiba’s focus though, and he continued to spin heavy-hitters with the precision of an artist deeply involved and invested in his work. The audience fed ravenously off this passion, morphing into a whirlpool of blurry bedlam in the throes of Shiba’s international club hit, “Okay.”</p>\n<p>Thoroughly danced out, the audience straggled away to catch their Ubers, Lyfts and party buses. We The Beat and SOhO proved to make a great pair, putting on an event that allowed Shiba San to truly shine. Much wow indeed.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn1P_yHI1hY</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/dirtybirds-shiba-san-takes-over-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/dirtybirds-shiba-san-takes-over-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/dirtybirds-shiba-san-takes-over-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/dirtybirds-shiba-san-takes-over-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/dirtybirds-shiba-san-takes-over-soho/","id":6841,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6840,6839,6838],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
