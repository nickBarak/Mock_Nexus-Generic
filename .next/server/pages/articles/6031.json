You deserve it. You deserve to be swooned by hopelessly romantic Wes. You deserve to get cramps from laughing at Asher’s douchebag jokes. And most importantly, you deserve to let Annalise Keating make you feel like a strong, independent woman! (Or man. It’s all about equality.) That’s right, I’m telling you to make time on Thirsty Thursdays for a new episode of “How to Get Away with Murder”. Not convinced, yet? Here’s how the top dogs in Hollywood put together a show so good that it should be illegal.</p>\n<p>Step 1: Find Scandalous Producers with a Knack for Female Anatomy.</p>\n<p>ABC’s new hit show “How to Get Away with Murder<em>” </em>is brought to us by none other than the fabulous Shonda Rhimes, Peter Nowalk and Betsy Beers. These names don’t ring a bell? Let me help you out. Rhimes, Nowalk and Beers are the creators and executive producers of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal<em>”</em>. It’s safe to say that they know a thing or two about strong female leads, hot love triangles and scandalous plots. “How to Get Away with Murder<em>”</em> tells the story of how Annalise Keating, a prestigious law professor and attorney who takes bullshit from no one, and her over-zealous students get involved in a murder plot. Think “Scandal<em>”</em> meets “Pretty Little Liars”. It’s edgy, funny and captivating. Who knew something as harmless as wallpaper could turn a person into a murder suspect? Warning: You WILL start questioning and psychoanalyzing your friends like a mini-detective.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Step 2: Get a Lead Actress That Helps Bring the Show to Life.</p>\n<p>Viola Davis stars as lead character Annalise Keating and, to be honest, no one could do it better. She’s a veteran in the business with roles under her belt like Aibileen from “The Help<em>”</em>. Davis’ infamous side-eye and crying-face give viewers the feels and make Keating into one determined, fierce woman. She’s taken the strong, female lead character to new territories by baring all — no makeup, no wig and (sometimes) no clothes. Davis as Annalise Keating is clever, sexy and unapologetic. Just like her faithful law students, we can’t help but want to be just like her. But I guess we’ll just have to settle for watching her performance in the next episode of “HTGAWM<em>”</em>.</p>\n<p>Step 3: Assemble a Magical Supporting Cast to Lock It All In.</p>\n<p>So unless you live under a rock, you’ve probably noticed that some of the “HTGAWM” actors look familiar. If you’re like me, you probably wish you had a boyfriend as sweet as Wes, but have you ever noticed he was in “Harry Potter”? Alfred Enoch, who plays the super fit, doting sweetheart willing to do anything to protect his neighbor from going to jail, played Dean Thomas in all of the “Harry Potter” movies. Oh yeah, team Gryffindor! No wonder we’ve got a soft spot for him.</p>\n<p>And if you loved Matt McGorry as the dreamy Officer Bennett in “Orange is the New Black<em>”</em>, check him out as Asher, the privileged douchebag with the inappropriate sense of humor. Unfortunately, we don’t get to see the stud in uniform in “HTGAWM<em>”</em>, but they did give us a pretty hot (and hilarious) dance scene.</p>\n<p>But even the less familiar actors deliver some amazing performances. Michaela (played by Aja Naomi King), the goody-two-shoes kiss-up, never fails to make us cringe and reminds us of someone in our own lives who is that annoying. And let’s all just admit that Connor (Jack Falahee) has the most epic sex life on the show (even steamier than Annalise’s). Basically, the supporting cast demands our attention just as much as the leading lady.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t started watching yet, you’re in luck because you only have about seven episodes to catch up on. So if you’re looking for a new show with a cast who is equally talented as they are attractive, and a murder plot that keeps things interesting and makes you feel like Sherlock Holmes, then it’s time to become a part of the “HTGAWM<em>” </em>fandom.</p>\n<p><em>Don’t forget to catch “How to Get Away with Murder” on ABC Thursdays at 10p.m. Jessica Gresham lives for Thursdays.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-22/how-to-guide-how-to-get-away-with-a-killer-tv-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-22/how-to-guide-how-to-get-away-with-a-killer-tv-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-22/how-to-guide-how-to-get-away-with-a-killer-tv-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-22/how-to-guide-how-to-get-away-with-a-killer-tv-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-22/how-to-guide-how-to-get-away-with-a-killer-tv-show/","id":6031,"author":{"id":747,"name":"Jessica Gresham"},"related":[6030,6029,6028],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":747,"name":"Jessica Gresham","biography":"Not available","articles":[6031,6043,6985,7075],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Mitchell Kriegman Explains It All: Eight Rules for a Creative Person to Live By","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Mitchell Kriegman, writer and creator of popular television shows “Clarissa Explains it All,” “Bear in the Big Blue House” and “Doug,” spoke in I.V.

Theater on Friday Nov. 7 about his experiences in television. After showing offbeat, nostalgia-invoking clips from his extensive career, he gave valuable advice for young people interested in breaking into the industry and shared his important eight rules to live by. Dressed in all black and poised with relaxed professionalism, Kriegman introduced these rules by saying that he pinned them up on his door when his writers were stressed or freaking out. Whether it is writer’s block or a lack of motivation or confidence, these rules are applicable and essential to any creative person.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 1: Don’t worry, and if you do don’t tell anybody.</p>\n<p>While working on different TV shows, Kriegman experienced many setbacks, from starting an idea over again to getting bad ratings. What he learned was that fear spreads. If one person is worried, it has a domino effect and starts to affect everybody. Worrying doesn’t do any good anyway. “Act like you know what you’re doing. Fake it until you make it,” he advised.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rule No. 2: Inspiration is overrated.</p>\n<p>Most people start projects only when they feel motivated and inspired, but Kriegman has another idea. “Don’t depend on inspiration. It’s unreliable. Inspiration comes and goes. It makes you feel good but it’s not always going to be there,” he said. “You don’t have to be inspired to start. Just start.” Shedding a new light on the predefined idea of inspiration, Kriegman preached that we don’t need to have it in order to create a great piece of work. If you wait forever for that perfect idea, it may never come.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 3: Wrap yourself in the cloak of creativity.</p>\n<p>Mixing a Harry Potter reference with real life counsel, the writer said, “I think creative people are really invulnerable, they just have to create. Rejection is not a problem.”</p>\n<p>He acknowledged the fact that rejection is actually a problem for many people, especially the difficulty in getting noticed and published. “Don’t be worried about submitting places and getting turned down,” Kriegman said. “It’s better to not care and just try. Try to find a place for your work — it doesn’t make you less of a writer if you get turned down.”</p>\n<p>Kriegman explained that there are two types of creativity: exhaustive and overflowing. Exhaustive creativity is the kind where someone creates just to get it out of his or her system and be done. Overflowing is creative that is never ending, and constantly leads to something new. The latter is geared toward success. “Rejection isn’t an issue. There are so many places for your work, you just need to find the right place.”</p>\n<p>Rule No. 4: There are no bad ideas.</p>\n<p>Any idea, especially one that you care about, is never a bad one. If they seem bad, remember that they are good ideas that just don’t have a place yet. Kriegman explained, “Ideas are like keys, you just need to find a door to open. Just because someone doesn’t see it yet, doesn’t mean it’s not good.” He used a personal example of how his novel, <em>Being Audrey Hepburn</em> was supposed to be a TV show or a screenplay, but found its “place” as a novel after he worked on it for twenty years.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 5: Don’t do it great, just make it a little bit better.</p>\n<p>Some are afraid that their ideas will not be good enough. The advice that Kriegman gives his students is, “Don’t do it great, just make it a little bit better.” According to the writer, lessening the pressure on projects eases the creation process. With constant tweaking, re-writing and working, ideas become something substantial. Citing the classic example of Michaelangelo slowly getting rid of stuff that’s not David, Kriegman showed that work is all about getting rid of bad versions to get to the good versions. But if you’re afraid to take the first step, it may never happen. If it’s not right in the beginning, it will get better.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 6: A lot can happen in a day.</p>\n<p>Instead of thinking about how much to get done in a day, focus on the process. Once you focus on it and not the concern, you will become more productive.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 7: Define your own victories.</p>\n<p>Live in a world that gives you credit. Kriegman gives himself credit for starting projects. As a man who always tries to do more, he said, “Solidly starting is as good as writing five pages in a day because it takes a lot of energy. When you define success, you have your own sense of what is success.”</p>\n<p>He described writer’s block as “having a better idea of something in your head that you’re able to write.” However, many people get hung up on even trying because they never get close to that so-called idea. The only way to be satisfied is to redefine it, and know that the product will never match up to the idea completely.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 8: Where you’re standing now is not where you’re going to be.</p>\n<p>There is always going to be something new. “Whatever you think you’re dealing with now, there’s going to be something else. You think you’ve rewritten a chapter, but then you’re exposed to new things to work on,” Kriegman said.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to always feel like something is not right, but the world is in a constant state of upheaval. The same problems and opportunities will never stay the same.

Her story inspired him enough to catch a train and knock on her door, initiating an eight-year mission to earn her trust and acquire the rights to her book to adapt it into a motion picture. For those eight years, he crafted a screenplay that became the film “The Theory of Everything”.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” traces the lives of the Hawkings from their first meeting at Cambridge University through the 1980s. Shortly after they met in 1963 and after only a few dates, Stephen was diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. Despite the tragic news, Jane decided to continue seeing him and dedicated herself to helping him fight the disease. They were engaged in 1964, and she stuck by him as the disease progressed, eventually causing him to lose his abilities to walk, talk and take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Stephen Hawking is famous for overcoming the limitations of his disease and making advances in the field of theoretical physics and cosmology. However, “The Theory of Everything” focuses on the behind-the-scenes aspects of Hawking’s life and the impact Jane had on it. She really was the unspoken hero, who gave up her studies in order to help him live, something he was not capable of doing on his own. Her efforts allowed him to focus on physics and make the accomplishments that made him the legend he is today.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray Stephen and Jane, and they do not disappoint. Their performances are exceptional. Redmayne’s portrayal is particularly impressive because of his lack of dialogue in the film. He depicted the slow deterioration of Stephen’s speech, which culminated in complete loss after a life-threatening surgery. Redmayne used facial expressions to convey much of Stephen’s emotions while illustrating the different stages of the disease, a difficult feat when one keeps in mind that scenes are not filmed in chronological order. Jones, on the other hand, excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle to balance taking care of her husband, raising their children and dealing with their financial problems.</p>\n<p>Although it wouldn’t really be a spoiler since the film is not fictional, I won’t reveal how the film and the Hawkings’ marriage pans out. But I will say that the final act gave me a new perspective on Stephen Hawking. I can say for certain that he would not have been able to do what he’s achieved or make the impacts he’s made if it was not for Jane Hawking. She gave up her dreams for love, dedicating her life to a man she had just met. She saw something in him that was powerful enough for her to make such a life-changing decision, and she was strong enough to devote herself to him. What she did is a great achievement in itself, and one that not very many people would be capable of. It had a larger impact on the world than she probably ever imagined.</p>\n<p>When I first walked into the screening at Pollock Theater, I felt the fear that I always get when seeing a biographical film, the fear that it wouldn’t effectively convey the intricacies of the subject’s life. These films boil down the long and complex journey of a person’s entire existence to two hours. Think of all the inherent problems and difficulties that could come with that. However, “The Theory of Everything” does not claim to delineate Hawking’s entire life, focusing instead on one particular aspect of it. And it portrayed that surprisingly well.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t the only one that didn’t house many complaints. In the Q&amp;A that followed the screening, Anthony McCarten told the story of when they screened the movie for Stephen Hawking himself. He was brought to tears, and after providing the gift of his unique computer voice to the producers, the only complaint he had was why it ended only halfway through his life.</p>\n<p><em>“The Theory of Everything” opens at the Camino Real Marketplace Theater on Nov. 21.

A powerful orb. An ambitious villain. A battle to save the universe. All these combine to form the thrilling, heart-warming and stellar adventure known as “Guardians of the Galaxy.”</p>\n<p>When adventurer Peter Quill acquires a mysterious orb, he finds himself tangled in a bounty hunt and struggle for power as parties across the galaxy battle for what’s later revealed as an infinity stone: a powerful object with the ability to decimate entire planets. On the run with a price on his head, he meets Gamora, an assassin with a heart of gold, Drax, a tough warrior with a soft inside, Rocket, an aggressive mercenary and Groot, a tree-like humanoid with a three-word vocabulary. Though bitter and hostile at first sight, these ragtag individuals eventually forge a deep bond and work together to save the galaxy from the all-powerful Ronan.</p>\n<p>Though the stunning visual effects may attract astronomical amounts of viewers, what really sells the film are the rich, complex characters. Combine that with witty dialogue and an epic soundtrack, and you have the second-highest grossing movie of 2014 at the worldwide box office.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>None if this would’ve happened if it weren’t for the man who put it all together, Fred Raskin. With action-packed scenes, voice-over dialogue and original music compositions (along with top hits from the 60s and 70s), Raskin had quite a bit on his hands. But with editing experience from “Django Unchained” and “Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2,” Raskin managed to plow through numerous stunt visuals and footage to deliver the final product in 13 months.</p>\n<p>The Philadelphia native started out as an apprentice editor during “Tromeo and Juliet,” after graduating from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. He met James Gunn, the director of “Guardians of the Galaxy,” during “Tromeo and Juliet,” where Gunn acted as the film’s writer. The two kept in touch after Gunn moved out to L.A. until Raskin received a Facebook message asking him to come to London to edit “Guardians of the Galaxy.”</p>\n<p>“Initially I was hesitant because if all you know is what you’ve read, you know it’s an obscure superhero team in which one of the characters is a talking raccoon. It could be disastrous,” Raskin said. “I held off on saying anything until I read the script. I got about a third of the way in and I was hooked. By the end I had a lump in my throat and I was like ‘I’m in. Let’s do it.’”</p>\n<p>Working with “Guardians of the Galaxy” was a little different from working with other movies like “Django Unchained.” While directors like Tarantino liked to work with footage as it exists during post-production, Raskin discovered that Marvel was willing to go through great lengths to make the movie the best it could be. “If we need to shoot an entirely new action sequence, everything is on the table,” Raskin explained.</p>\n<p>Another unique quality of Marvel is that its movies are connected in a multi-universe, one that warrants much collaboration. Once the film got past the director’s cut, Raskin sat with the heads of Marvel Studios (Kevin Feige, Louis D’Esposito and Victoria Alonso), Marvel’s production executive Jonathan Schwartz and director Gunn. They discussed different aspects of the film from how to tackle certain scenes to restructuring the first third of the movie. As a result, Raskin found himself more involved in the process than in any other movie prior, and appreciated the opportunities to simply throw out ideas.</p>\n<p>“One of our meetings was specifically about the tag [at the end of the credits],” Raskin said. “Well, what if The Collector and Cosmo were there and (I feel like I started the thought and Kevin Feige finished it) and Howard the Duck is there? We all looked around the room and said ‘It’s ridiculous but let’s see if we have the footage to make it work.’”</p>\n<p>Fred Raskin had a bigger hand in the film’s content than his editor title acknowledges, and his keen ideas helped create “Guardians of the Galaxy” as the delightful adventure it’s known as today. Stay tuned for coverage of his next film, “The Hateful Eight,” where he will work alongside once again with Quentin Tarantino.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/crIaEzXgqtoframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/crIaEzXgqto\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/q-a-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-editor-fred-raskin-shares-editing-experience-with-marvel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/q-a-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-editor-fred-raskin-shares-editing-experience-with-marvel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/q-a-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-editor-fred-raskin-shares-editing-experience-with-marvel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/q-a-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-editor-fred-raskin-shares-editing-experience-with-marvel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/q-a-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-editor-fred-raskin-shares-editing-experience-with-marvel/","id":6030,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6029,6028,6027],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
