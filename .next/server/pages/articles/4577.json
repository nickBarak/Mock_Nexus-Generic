Clinic building to discuss solutions to Isla Vista’s problematic parking situation.</p>\n<p>I.V. has long suffered from overcrowding and a lack of parking, with students and families struggling to find cheap and accessible parking spots. The meeting discussed long-term parking regulations, potential parking permits and affordability for low-income families.</p>\n<p>Matt Schneider, Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division, said a parking monitoring program could provide useful information about the parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We held a meeting here in Isla Vista in October and we talked about what the current parking plan is in Isla Vista — a master plan update,” Schneider said. “Right now it revolves around a parking monitoring program, and they would require surveying parking conditions on an annual basis.”</p>\n<p>Jen Brookshire, Parking Enforcing Officer, said she often encounters issues with sidewalk parking and long-term vehicle parking. Santa Barbara County municipal code states, “No person who owns or has possession, custody or control of any vehicle shall park such vehicle upon any street or alley for more than a consecutive period of seventy-two (72) hours.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67346\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67346\" data-attachment-id=\"67346\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/stakeholders_by-paris-cullen-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452671348\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Paris Cullen-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67346\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67346\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“We are trying to work on not having long-term parking [restrictions] so parking is more available for the students,” Brookshire said. “Sidewalk parking is a big one that I.V. foot patrol is looking at. You cannot be blocking the sidewalk. It’s a safety hazard for pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>The Surfrider Foundation, a coastline preservation agency, presented a two-year parking proposal outlining parking permits, guest passes, cost and time restrictions:</p>\n<p>1. Permits would be issued only to I.V. residents.<br>\n2. Guest passes would be available.<br>\n3. Permits would be required for all cars parked on Isla Vista streets between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.<br>\n4. The cost of the permits would be as affordable as possible.<br>\n5. Potential sources of funding are Santa Barbara County, UCSB and available grants.<br>\n6. Monitoring would be conducted by student residents of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major, said the permits could still be too costly for low-income families.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking of my own family … how would they go about the situation? For one, they’d worry about the cost. Two, we don’t just have one car. We’re a family, we have multiple cars. How will that work?” Dela Cruz said. “I know some of the familias here who … have a van and the mom has a smaller car to just move around. I just feel like we’re creating steps that are not making it easier for them. It’s making it even more difficult for them to get parking when they already have problems in their life.”</p>\n<p>Scott McGolpin, Director of Santa Barbara Public Works Department Transportation Division, said UCSB could restrict first-year residents from buying permits.</p>\n<p>“The university has their rates so high to dissuade students from bringing their cars, but the fact of the matter is they bring them and park them in I.V.,” McGolphin said. “What other UC system schools have done is they don’t allow freshmen to bring the cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/","id":4577,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[4576,4575,4574],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias","biography":"Not available","articles":[2539,2549,2581,2612,2635,3853,4577,4637],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Thousands of LED headlights were given out to attendees to promote rider visibility. <em>Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Campus and community organizations came together to host I.V. LUX, an event to promote bicycle safety, Wednesday at the Associated Students Pardall Center in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Host organizations included Associate Students Bike Committee (ASBC), Office of Student Affairs, the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Department, the Office of Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr and the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. During the event, 1,500 LED bike lights were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis to local bikers, made possible by funds from ASBC and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Yeh, ASBC Administrative Coordinator and third-year mathematics major, said the LED light giveaway was part of the Bike Committee’s plan to improve UCSB bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to change the bike culture here in I.V. and on campus,” Yeh said. “More specifically, right now, because there are so many accidents at night, we are handing out lights. In conjunction with that, we are giving out a lot of bike safety information and tips.”</p>\n<p>Yeh said ASBC also hopes to improve UCSB’s standing in the League of American Bicyclists’ Annual Bicycle Friendly University awards program, which celebrates universities that have a positive bike culture.</p>\n<p>“The Bike Committee is focused on creating and maintaining bike paths on campus and worrying about bike safety on campus,” Yeh said. “With this event, we are trying to include in our mission an education portion in order to get a [League of American Bicyclists] platinum standing. Platinum ranking is one of our goals this year.”</p>\n<p>Stacy Kowsz, ASBC graduate student representative, said improving bike safety education in the community is one way UCSB can move from gold to platinum level in the League.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we are gold, we want to be platinum. Currently, only a couple universities are platinum, like Stanford and Davis,” Kowsz said. “One of the things we are lacking that the platinum universities have is better education and bike safety. We have tons of people using bikes which is awesome and we do have great bike infrastructure, bikes have a strong presence, but what we don’t have is great bike safety. One of our goals is to improve the culture and make it more safe.”</p>\n<p>Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of student life, said although there are many problems with bike safety in “a lot of different spots,” bike lights are one step toward a safer bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We thought about what we could do that would be positive, so we combined resources with the A.S. Bike Committee and the Dean of Students office to put some funds together to get some bike lights,” Fleming said. “One of the easiest things for people to do is just put a light on your bike at night.”</p>\n<p>According to Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell, the current culture in I.V. is such that cyclists do not feel the need to follow the same laws as cars.<br>\n“A lot of people don’t understand that bicycles are vehicles, and when you’re riding a bicycle, you have to obey the same traffic laws as you would in a car,” McKarrell said. “A lot of the issues we see are people running stop signs and failing to yield to pedestrians. What happens then is we have traffic collisions, mostly either bicyclists-on-bicyclists or bicyclists-on-pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said there is a unique issue with the busy intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, where there is currently a two-way stop sign.</p>\n<p>“The problem with that intersection is there’s free-flowing traffic going east and west and the people traveling north and south have to constantly wait. The bicyclists traveling east and west are within their rights,” McKarrell said. “The only thing I can suggest to be more safe is to not cut behind cars, to maintain a safe speed and to maintain awareness of their surroundings.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said a possible way to improve safety at this locations could be to create a new traffic control device, such as a stoplight or additional stop signs.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be looking at the intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, and we’re going to see if a traffic control device would help cut down on the amount of accidents and the amount of problems we have at that intersection,” Mckarrell said.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, although it may be the busiest intersection, Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte is not the most dangerous intersection in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Believe it or not, as busy as that intersection is, it’s not as problematic as Camino Pescadero and Pardall,” McKarrell said. “I think it’s because there are a lot of blind spots there, and, again, it comes down to people not obeying the traffic signs, and they’ll pull out in front of other bicyclists or cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/","id":4574,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4573,4572,4571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"District Supervisor Candidates Share Platforms","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor candidates spoke with the Nexus this week to share their platforms for Isla Vista and the county.

He currently works as president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition and Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Porter announced in late January his plan to initiate an Economic Prosperity Corridor should he be elected as supervisor. According to Porter, most of the tech firms in Santa Barbara County are located in Goleta, which he said forces workers to commute on the 101 from their homes in the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“As I’ve met with officials at UCSB, I’ve learned of a wave of new companies and new technologies that will be spinning out of research at UCSB, and in the past a lot of those just went into Goleta,” Porter said. “Goleta is pretty well built-out now.”</p>\n<p>His plan with the Economic Prosperity Corridor is to encourage businesses to “set up shop” in areas like Buellton, Lompoc and Santa Maria to reduce the number of freeway commuters. According to Porter, this initiative will help to reduce pollution, preserve infrastructure and allow UCSB grads to stay in the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Let’s move those new businesses out into other parts of the county where they’ll be closer to the people who actually work there,” Porter said. “That would be keeping all these great businesses in the county.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V., Porter said he hopes to be a leader and a “champion” for getting the Community Services District (CSD) proposal passed in November. He said the ultimate goal for I.V. is cityhood.</p>\n<p>“In the long range, the goal is cityhood for Isla Vista, if that’s what the residents want. The CSD is sort of a tiny little step to that eventual goal,” Porter said. “[I want to help] shape the whole process over time so that we continue the path to full cityhood.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68106\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68106\" data-attachment-id=\"68106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-joan-hartmann-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Joan Hartmann\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68106 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=296%2C431\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org\" width=\"296\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Planning Commissioner Joan Hartmann declared candidacy in early January in hopes to “continue and build on” the role of her soon-to-retire employer, Farr.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s career began in academia when she earned a Ph.D. in Government from Claremont Graduate School, where she was appointed as the first female faculty member and director of the Public Policy Program. She also served on the faculty at Oberlin College and later served as adjunct professor at USC. She currently serves on the Santa Barbara Foundation’s LEAF Advisory Committee and the Wilding Museum’s Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>According to Hartmann, the platform of her bid for supervisor is “enhancing the quality of life that we cherish in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen Farr has done a really good job connecting people to county resources, and her staff has worked hard to provide good, strong constituency services,” Hartmann said. “I would like to build on that.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said one of the issues she hopes to address is economic vitality in the county. She said she hopes to increase cooperation between the private and public sectors, following the models laid out by Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County and Sonoma County.</p>\n<p>“The question is, ‘What do we want in Santa Barbara County?’” Hartmann said. “I would like the county to help bring the various entities together and hear that out in a more deliberate way.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V. and the University, Hartmann said she wants to take on a similar role as Farr in regularly meeting with residents and university officials.</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen and her staff have worked very hard to participate in the various working groups and committees in Isla Vista, and I would certainly continue that,” Hartmann said. “I know she also meets regularly with UCSB representatives and tries to find ways that they can work together on issues. I would want to continue that and build on it.”</p>\n<p>Should I.V. residents approve a CSD in November, Hartmann said she would be supportive but yielding to the needs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“If there is a CSD, I think that is something I would support,” Hartmann said. “As a supervisor, I think it’s really something that is controlled largely by the community. I think that’s the whole point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68105\" style=\"width: 323px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68105\" data-attachment-id=\"68105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-jay-freeman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Jay Freeman-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68105 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=313%2C456\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac\" width=\"313\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac</p></div>\n<p>Sixteen-year I.V. resident Jay Freeman declared candidacy late January in order to fill a role where he said he seems to be needed.</p>\n<p>Freeman grew up in Chicago and came to UCSB in 1999 to study computer science. He is the founder of the multimillion-dollar software company Cydia, an app that allows users to customize jailbroken Apple devices. Freeman currently serves as vice president of the Isla Vista Downtown Business Association and is an active member of the Isla Vista Self-Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>As for Freeman’s involvement in the supervisor race, Freeman said he has “kind of fallen into this” — he believes the county’s board of supervisors is a place that has shown a need for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a career politician in the sense that I want to rise through the ranks,” Freeman said. “I want essentially to be the man in the field who’s actually trying to figure out how to make practical solutions to real world problems, as opposed to sitting back and doing legislation.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the county needs to be more proactive in serving its residents.<br>\n“The county just allows problems to occur, then waits for people to complain about them and then tries to quell the uprising,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said one of the issues he hopes to address as supervisor is the lack of interaction between I.V. residents and county officials. According to Freeman, it is inadequate that state assemblymember Das Williams has had to host meetings to foster communication between I.V. and the county.</p>\n<p>“It’s slightly awkward that we’ve had to have our state assemblymember run meetings that are almost mediating between the people of Isla Vista and the county,” Freeman said. “That’s the kind of meeting that I would have expected that the county would have been setting up.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he wants to be a county supervisor that is actively involved in local meetings in the county’s unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“I actually want to try to sit down in various local meetings and try to come up with compromises between bringing people together,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V. cannot attain the full benefits of a CSD unless the county “steps up” and institutes a Municipal Advisory Council or an Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“With a Community Services District, one of the powers that it can have is to fund a Municipal Advisory Council, but it doesn’t have the power to make a Municipal Advisory Council,” Freeman said. “The county has to support that.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

to raise money for solar panels for the Isla Vista Food Co-op as part of their goal to improve sustainability in the community.</p>\n<p>The Solar Ambassadors program is a college-campus extension of the San Francisco based nonprofit, RE-volv. Students from different colleges and universities annually organize, develop and fundraise for a solar energy project in their communities. UCSB’s chapter is gaining momentum this year and plans to run its crowdfunding campaign for at least six weeks.</p>\n<p>Project leader and third-year environmental studies major Kaylan Lamb said she became involved with Solar Ambassadors when a professor of a class she took last year encouraged students to apply.</p>\n<p>“We had an email from our professor to get interests together, and then we made up a team and applied,” Lamb said. “And you have to sign a local nonprofit or cooperative that owns their own building and that could potentially get solar panels on their building.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said the Solar Ambassadors program only works with nonprofits and cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“It’s only nonprofits and co-ops because they usually don’t have the type of funds and can’t get the type of financing in order to afford solar on their own, so that’s where we come in,” Lamb said. “We decided on the I.V. Food Co-op because they’re really interested and had just gotten a new roof installed. It’s perfect timing.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said there there will be a launch event for the campaign in early February at the Co-op.</p>\n<p>“We have a few events planned,” Lamb said. “One of them is the launch event that will be held at the Co-op to get the word out to the community and target the student population that comes in and out of the Co-op as well as the adult population that also shops there.”</p>\n<p>Team member and fourth-year environmental science major Ingrid Medina said the project will help educate the community on the positive impact of solar energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s really good to show people that it’s possible to be sustainable and also promote renewable energy,” Medina said. “We want to educate on how much of an impact it’s going to make.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Olivia Godfrey said she is happy to be part of the Solar Ambassadors team because of its promotion of community-wide sustainability.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to get involved with a project of this scale because it’s promoting sustainability in a way that’s pretty attainable for both students and the community,” Godfrey said. “I feel like a lot of people get the sense that solar is more like a private thing … but this project really goes to show that it can be a group effort to make something big happen.”</p>\n<p>Co-op General Manager Melissa Cohen said the project is not only about increasing solar energy use, but also about members of the community coming together to affect change.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about the panels, which are an obviously great addition to our store,” Cohen said. “The method by which RE-volv makes their projects happen is directly in line with our people-powered, community-owned grocery store.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, the project will succeed if the community comes together to support the cause of clean energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s totally based in people believing in the project and helping steward it into existence,” Cohen said. “This is how movements begin, and how communities can become more and more healthy as people being to see that they’re part of something bigger than themselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67745\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-vista-food-co-op-to-receive-solar-panels/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67745\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-vista-food-co-op-to-receive-solar-panels/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-vista-food-co-op-to-receive-solar-panels/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-vista-food-co-op-to-receive-solar-panels/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-vista-food-co-op-to-receive-solar-panels/","id":4576,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[4575,4574,4573],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
