Law enforcement officers addressed concerns about police barricades, amnesty legislation, noise ordinance and Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p>UCPD Sergeant Matt Bowman said the festival ordinance on loud music, which began Oct. 26, will be in place until Nov. 4.</p>\n<p>“The ordinance is if it’s able to be heard from the street, so that means the property line, so police walk out to the street to listen,” Bowman said. “If they can hear it, it’s too loud.”</p>\n<p>According to Bowman, streets will be cleared of cars and police barricades will be in place from 5 p.m. until 3 a.m. on the days surrounding Halloween.</p>\n<p>“At about 3 p.m., they’re going to start towing cars off the street, and, again, that’s to benefit the entire community, because it gets so compacted with people walking up and down the street that those extra cars on the street make it unpassable, and we need to open it up,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said the barricades will not completely block off the roads because some vehicles may need to pass in an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want you to, but if it’s an emergency situation, you may — but, goodness, be careful; there’s a lot of people out there,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said it is important to understand amnesty legislation, which protects any individual from being charged for possession if they call emergency services for someone in need of help.</p>\n<p>“Amnesty is legislation … that says police officers will not make arrests in cases where people call to get people medical aid,” Bowman said. “So remove that fear, get that person the help that they need, because the last thing any of us want, I’m sure, certainly all the officers, is for somebody to not get the help they need when they’re intoxicated or overdosing or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Bowman also said UCSB’s costume policy bans students from wearing masks on campus, and wearing them in I.V. may make things more difficult for officers.</p>\n<p>“If you are detained by an officer, they do have the right to identify you if they have reasonable suspicion or probable cause, so you may be asked to remove it to verify who it is under the mask,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Julio Gutierrez said he expects Halloween this year to be tamer than in past years.</p>\n<p>“I think that after the riots, the community has done a very good job of keeping it low-key, keeping it a more localized event,” Gutierrez said. “I know a lot more students this year are against having outsiders come in. For the most part, they’re doing their part.”</p>\n<p>According to Gutierrez, starting the music ordinance at 6 p.m. will help prevent problems as the night progresses.</p>\n<p>“Because the Halloween event is one that is known to attract a lot of outsiders, what a lot of people do is they tend to party during the day and come out to the streets at night,” Gutierrez said. “If you party during the day, drink alcohol during the day, by the time night time comes around, people are intoxicated, they make poor decisions, inhibitions are thrown to the wind, then we have the problems in the latter part of the night.”</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement officers are present to ensure safety, and Halloween is no different from any other night.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to ensure that if someone is intoxicated to the point where they can’t care for themselves, that they’ll have someone watch out for them,” Gutierrez said. “Unfortunately, watching out for them in that state means taking them to the hospital or to jail. People drink; sometimes they go overboard. As long as everybody’s safe and no one gets hurt or injured, then, for us, that’s a good night.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Kim Fryslie said the best way for students to make sure they are not breaking laws is to understand them. Fryslie recommends students to Google “SB County ordinances” and look on the county page at the following link: <em><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc\">countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc</a></em></p>\n<p>“I think a lot of the problem in Isla Vista is that the information is presented to the students in such a way that some find it not very comprehensive, and this site will be helpful to those who want to know exactly … how they can safely follow the rules,” Fryslie said.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement and students have the same goal for Halloween celebrations.</p>\n<p>“I think a perfect night for us is we come out here, we patrol and we don’t have to arrest anybody or write any tickets,” Gutierrez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/","id":4622,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4621,4620,4619],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian","biography":"Not available","articles":[2931,2947,2960,3459,3760,3773,3778,3779,3780,3781,3782,3784,3936,3937,3938,3940,3941,3942,4622,4747,4772,4783,4790,4796],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building for residents to discuss community planning and development.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents will vote in November 2016 to approve the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) funded by a Utility Users Tax. A board of local representatives would govern a CSD, giving I.V. more autonomy than it currently holds as an unincorporated area. Tuesday’s meeting was the second in a series of 11 weekly meetings the Initiative organized for I.V. stakeholders to discuss the specific framework of the CSD. The meeting focused on incorporating a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC) with the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to Community Organizer from Das Williams’s office Darcel Elliott, the Initiative’s weekly meetings serve as forums for residents to discuss local government options within the framework of a CSD.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The goal of these meetings is to talk about the services that the CSD can provide and discuss how we would want these provided under that structure, and also create some community priorities,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City Council member Gregg Hart was a member of the previous I.V. Community Council (IVCC), a MAC, during the 1980s, which dissolved after the county and UC cut funding. According to Hart, the county stopped funding the MAC because the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors felt IVCC was not solving I.V.’s issues and was therefore not “serving the function” that was intended.</p>\n<p>“Issues remained contentious and difficult and didn’t always get resolved,” Hart said. “They were looking for more finality, more cohesion and consensus coming from Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Hart said a CSD through Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) will provide I.V. the autonomy and structure needed to solve issues.<br>\n“I thought AB 3 was a great step forward,” Hart said. “I supported it — sent letters to the governor. It’s time. Isla Vista deserves this kind of representation.”</p>\n<p>According to Glenn Russell, Director of Planning and Development for the County of Santa Barbara, APCs review development projects in their designated community and advise the Board of Supervisors on these projects.</p>\n<p>“For certain development projects, they are the final decision maker, unless it is appealed to the Board of Supervisors,” Russell said. “For other projects, they make a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors.”</p>\n<p>Russell said the current APCs in Santa Barbara County, including the Montecito APC and the Santa Barbara APC, review the Board of Supervisors’ projects but cannot “initiate policy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65925\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2100988285\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65928\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65925\" data-attachment-id=\"65925\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/meeting-attendees-listen-attentively-as-others-voice-their-opinions/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Meeting attendees listen attentively as others voice their opinions.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445923127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"Meeting attendees listen attentively as others voice their opinions.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65925 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1-682x1024.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“They do not advise the Board on issues they feel are important,” Russell said. “They simply review projects and review policy initiatives and community plans that are ordinances initiated by the Board.”</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the cost per meeting for the Montecito APC is around $3,000, which he said would be similar for I.V. Elliott, however, said the cost could be reduced to $2,000 per meeting.</p>\n<p>Longtime resident Sue Dixon said local issues “generate” from poor planning and development, therefore she supports the establishment of an APC.</p>\n<p>“The density is because of how it was zoned in the first place, and as we continue to make variances as we build more buildings, it increases the parking problem and crime and everything else,” Dixon said. “I think it’s really fundamental to have that power here.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) chairperson and longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said a MAC would address issues such as parking and policing more effectively and extensively than the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“I see it as being really beneficial because you can do much more engagement here in the community with a series of meetings here than one or two meetings downtown,” Soutar said. “The more that we coalesce and the more we show up with similar ideas and concerns, the more we will be listened to.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond said the same representatives should govern a MAC and CSD to eliminate the ambiguity of what each entity is able to discuss.</p>\n<p>“I think there should be as much overlap as possible because it neatly avoids the question of what we’re allowed to talk about,” Hammond said. “It’s a sort of conservation of bureaucracy. There’s one less conversation that needs to come up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the CSD leadership should have a presence in a MAC, some seats should be open to stakeholders that cannot be elected or appointed to a CSD governing board, such as nonprofit organization representatives.</p>\n<p>“I think we should have the MAC and the CSD have some overlap, but not a great deal,” Abboud said. “My personal opinion is that all five elected CSD members should also be on the MAC but the MAC should be, say, six additional stakeholder groups and organizations.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, October 29 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/","id":4620,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4619,4618,4617],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Final Candidates Join Race for Office in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ivgov.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ivgov.jpg?resize=440%2C258&ssl=1","description":"Three additional Isla Vista residents declared candidacy this week in the race to elect the inaugural members of the I.V.

Community Service District (CSD) board of directors, finalizing the ballot before the August 12 filing deadline.</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, Andrew Gabriel Pragin and Joel Ruiz declared candidacy this week. These new candidates join five other candidates— Ethan Bertrand, Stephen Brandt, Natalie Jordan, Jon-Stephen Hedges and Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the addition of these candidates, the race for the CSD board of directors was unopposed, but now numerous candidates will be running in competitive races.</p>\n<p>The CSD, a proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\">form of local government</a> for I.V., will have the power to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords if it is approved in the coming November election. It will appear as Measure E on the ballot alongside the candidates for the board of directors.</p>\n<p>As outlined in Assembly Bill 3, the recently passed legislation allowing for the CSD, the board of directors shall be made up of five members elected at large and two members appointed by the county and university.</p>\n<p>Of the five elected board members, four directors must serve four-year terms and one director serves a two-year term. Two of the four-year positions, however, have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates for the board’s first election this November.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72146\" style=\"width: 209px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1386642308\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72146\" data-attachment-id=\"72146\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"199,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72146\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?resize=199%2C300\" alt=\"Michael Kile was a prominent member of UCSB for Bernie and attended the Democratic National Convention in July.

He was involved in UCSB for Bernie and served as a delegate for Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign at the Democratic National Convention in July.</p>\n<p>He was also a part of VOCEROS de UCSB, a student organization that focuses on providing resources for Latino students, and said he hopes to represent the Latino students and families of I.V.</p>\n<p>Kile said he joined the race to contest the slate of Democrats—Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt—who <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">declared candidacy last week</a>. He wants to pose himself as an alternative to “a slate of people who will do what the county wants them to do,” he said, or at least push Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt to be “more responsive to the people of I.V.”</p>\n<p>“I dislike the idea of a full slate being pushed,” he said. “What makes me different is that I’m removed from the current network of county people or the desire to rise up in politics. I want to be here as an advocate, not as a politician.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, campaign organizer for the Yes on E &amp; F campaign, said such claims that Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt are “in the back pocket of the county” are “patently false.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a statement made in a vacuum. Where’s the grounding or basis for that?” Schunk said. “This is a group of like-minded people who have a shared vision for Isla Vista. It has nothing to do with the county.”</p>\n<p>Pragin, who declared candidacy Friday morning, will also be running for the temporary two-year position. This is the “next logical step,” he said, since he has been a part of “the CSD conversation” for more than a year now.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66581\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"805798877\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66581\" data-attachment-id=\"66581\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447788089\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"150\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pragin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66581\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Pragin (right) discusses the CSD at a stakeholders meeting in November, 2015.
