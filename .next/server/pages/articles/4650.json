A woman with the Feminasty Guardians spoke about her enlightening experience in coming out about her sexuality and the aggression she found fighting against it. Kepski brought up Eric Daniel Villalobos, a representative from the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p>Villalobos explained that the Student Activist Network is a new group on campus dedicated to promoting activism and that they helped organize speakers for this event, plan its route and inform possible participants and onlookers.</p>\n<p>The Rapid Response Network, he added, is a service that will notify students about events regarding “struggles of racial justice, environmental degradation, discrimination against the LGBTQ community and issues of immigration.”</p>\n<p>The march ended with a final statement from Kepski.</p>\n<p>“We have to continue this conversation. This is just the beginning”.</p>\n<p>Though the march had ended, a group of at least 20 students continued chanting back through Del Playa Drive to Pardall Road, continuing to spread their message.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_73217\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1204770414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73214\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73217\" data-attachment-id=\"73217\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/feminasty-guardians-protest-against-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Student Activist Network\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73217 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Student Activist Network is a new group on campus created to organize activists. <em>Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Less than 30 officers are expected to patrol on Sunday and Monday, he said.</p>\n<p>UCPD will be sourcing officers from seven different University of California campuses to supplement its staff. Officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, UC San Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Riverside will arrive at UCSB on Oct. 27 to attend a one-day training prior to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 UCPD officers were present in I.V. last year, Signa said, but this year “there’s a better understanding within the whole community, this idea of trying to keep it safe, keep it local.” He said initiatives like UC Isla Vista Volunteering Program have been “fantastic” at drawing students away from parties and toward local events.</p>\n<p>Although the department hopes to gradually decrease police presence by higher increments, “we’re always kind of nervous about what’s going to happen,” Signa said. UCPD can call on the Santa Barbara Police Department and additional UC officers in the case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>IVFP, an offshoot of the Santa Barbara County Police Department, plans to post approximately 100 officers in I.V. on Friday and Saturday, 50 officers on Sunday and 75 on Monday, according to IVFP Sergeant Chris Gotschall.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73145\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73145\" data-attachment-id=\"73145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/policestats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"357,181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"policestats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=250%2C127&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?resize=456%2C200\" alt=\"Icon courtesy of Symbolon; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus\" width=\"456\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=456%2C200 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=456%2C200 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Icon courtesy of Symbolon, Noun Project; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The department came to the decision after coordinating with both UCPD and UCSB administration. “Based on how much quieter Halloween was last year, they determined that they could actually decrease their coverage.” Gotschall said.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that this is a good sign; that things are more manageable in Isla Vista and on campus and the need for the presence of police officers is less,” Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers arrested less than 30 people during Halloween weekend last year, down from over 100 in years prior, and crime is expected to stay low this year. The department currently has no plans to bring horses into I.V. as mounted patrol units, but Gotschall said this could change in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want unsafe parties, we don’t want people coming in from all over to cause mischief,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because Halloween falls on a Monday this year, less activity is expected on Halloween Day.

Included in the 10 points are proposals for the temporary seizure of guns from dangerous individuals and background checks on all gun sales. Schneider also presented the idea for a $10 billion national gun buyback program in her plans. The Santa Barbara Police Department (SBPD) held a gun buyback program the past two summers, allowing owners to return their guns for money, no questions asked.</p>\n<p>Schneider said as a result of the SBPD buybacks, hundreds of guns in the Santa Barbara area are now “off the streets.”</p>\n<p>“We could calculate 55 million guns off the street with this kind of [national] program,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said gun control is a “top priority” in light of recent mass shootings, including those at Northern Arizona University and Umpqua Community College in Oregon.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we’ve seen the very tragic events both in Isla Vista last year,” Schneider said. “Everywhere you turn, these kind of incidents happen, and as a mayor you don’t want to get that call that someone’s been shot and killed due to gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who organized a vigil to honor victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting, said he discussed the importance of gun laws with Assemblymember Das Williams in the past.</p>\n<p>“Take guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “If that’s gun control, then I’m all for it. Certain people should not have guns; that’s all.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Assembly Bill 1014, a legislation similar to Schneider’s 10th point which allows law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from a person who poses immediate danger, will only be effective if Californians know they can request a dangerous person’s weapons be removed.</p>\n<p>“Having [AB 1014] on the books is helpful but a lot of people don’t know about that,” Armbruster-Sandoval said.</p>\n<p>Owner of Dodge City Shooters Supply Rick Dodge said most of Schneider’s proposals would have little effect on his gun store because California gun laws are already some of the strictest in the country.</p>\n<p>“Most of those things don’t apply to California because we already have them,” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Dodge said while he is in favor of background checks, gun owners are prone to undeserved scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“Thirty-thousand people die in a car accident every year, so why don’t we all drive cars at 15 miles per hour with rubber tires put all the way around?” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said attention to recent mass shootings will make gun laws a prevalent topic in the upcoming 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s changing in the last couple of years especially is that general voters, democrats, republicans, gun owners, non-gun owners are saying enough is enough,” Schneider said. “This is going to be and should be a campaign issue in 2016.”</p>\n<p>Dodge said Schneider’s proposal may have an unexpected effect even if it fails to go into law.</p>\n<p>“When [politicians] talk about it … more people rush into the stores and are worried about more stringent regulations, it creates more sales for us,” Dodge said. “We always joke around: The best salesman in the world is President Obama — he mentions something and everyone around the nation rushes in to buy.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
