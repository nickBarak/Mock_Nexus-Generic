","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January, UC Santa Barbara released its yearly </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus profile</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a report that provides specific details about the school’s population, demographics, financial aid and student residence, which revealed a continuing trend — a slow rise in the student population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to accommodate the rising number of students, the UC has undertaken various housing projects, such as the construction of the San Joaquin student apartments and of a new classroom </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> slated to open spring 2023, said Andrea Estrada, a UCSB spokesperson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have hired additional faculty; provided more resources for TAs; hired additional staff; expanded Summer Sessions curriculum; built and planned (and are planning) new housing for students, faculty and staff; renovated and expanded classrooms,” Estrada said in a statement.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the campus profile, UCSB received a slight increase in freshman applicants. However the UC-wide number of applicants decreased, according to University of California Office of the President (UCOP) data.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the UC system, the number of freshman applicants decreased by 2.5% from the last school year, but transfer student applications increased by 4.7%, according to a UCOP Fact Sheet.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cost of college attendance is a major concern to students and more and more students are opting to attend local community colleges where they can take advantage of “Promise” programs that cover the cost of tuition and books,” UCSB Admissions Director Lisa Przekop said a statement provided by Estrada.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “</span><a href=\"https://home.cccapply.org/money/california-college-promise-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promise</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” program, formally known as the California Promise Grant, offers full-time students tuition-free community college for a maximum of two years. Stett Holbrook also cited the Promise Grant as a possible reason for lower application rates. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the total number of students on campus </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rose</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a consistent trend across all UCs — UCSB, along with UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, enrolled a smaller number of in-state students. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The number of incoming students, both in- and out-of-state, fluctuates every year. Like every other university in the system, we do our best to estimate how many will accept our invitation to enroll,” Estrada said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For the 2019-20 academic year, the number of in- and out-of-state students who chose to enroll at UC Santa Barbara was slightly different from what we anticipated,” Estrada added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of in-state students at UCSB has been gradually decreasing since 2009, resulting in California residents making up 79.2% of the student body for the 2019-20 school year as opposed to 93.2% of the student body in 2009. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-aAX5i\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"The percentage of California resident undergraduates at UCSB has decreased since 2009.&amp;nbsp;\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aAX5i/1/\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the UC as a whole increased its number of in-state students, according to its fall enrollment </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus profile also contained estimated yearly costs for students. Room and board estimates for this school year dipped slightly from $15,273 to $15,111 due to the estimates being based on UCSB-owned housing costs rather than the commercial rental market.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total amount for student financial aid in 2019-20 was $448,450,248, averaging out to $23,336 per student, a slight increase from the last school year. For undergraduates, 65% of their aid came from grants, while 89% of graduate student aid came from fellowships. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">73% of students at UCSB this year received some form of financial aid through the university, but 97% of graduate students received aid compared to 70% of undergraduates.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in previous years, physical and biological sciences was the largest major discipline, encompassing 46% of all undergraduates and 35% of all graduate students. Social and cultural studies contained 33% of all undergraduates; languages, humanities and arts had 13%; interdisciplinary/unknown undergraduates had 8% and engineering/computer science had 7%. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For graduate students, engineering/computer science was the second most popular field with 26%, followed by languages, humanities and arts with 16%, social and cultural studies with 13%, education with 8% and interdisciplinary/unknown with 3%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38% of UCSB students live in university-owned housing and 34% live in Isla Vista, with the rest of the student population living in Santa Barbara, Goleta or other locations. This data falls in line with last year’s profile, as more students live in university-owned housing than I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student ethnic demographics remained consistent with previous years, with white students composing 38% of the campus, Chicano/Latino students at 28%, Asian/Pacific Islander students at 27%, Black students at 5% and Native American/Alaskan students at 1%. The remaining 2% of students either did not specify or declined to state their ethnicities.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/uc-santa-barbara-releases-2019-20-campus-population-data/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/uc-santa-barbara-releases-2019-20-campus-population-data/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/uc-santa-barbara-releases-2019-20-campus-population-data/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/uc-santa-barbara-releases-2019-20-campus-population-data/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/uc-santa-barbara-releases-2019-20-campus-population-data/","id":3448,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[3447,3446,3445],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil","biography":"Not available","articles":[1818,1824,1826,1920,1932,1943,1963,1965,3301,3326,3360,3366,3367,3390,3448,3463,4003,4015,4026,4058,4084,4237,4238,4288,4301],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Five Resident Assistants Give First Years Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Balancing college courses and new extracurricular activities is hard enough as it is, but living with one, maybe even two roommates for the first time can add a whole new layer of stress.

studies major Nicole Willard</p></div>\n<p>Their advice:</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: What is the best piece of advice you can give a freshman moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh</em>: Bring only what you need and be mindful that you’re sharing the room. It’s helpful to communicate with your roommate(s) before moving in so you can organize who is bringing what and avoid possibly bringing two fridges!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> “Just do it!!” Shia LaBeouf hits the nail on the head with this statement when it comes to being involved. When you first move in, you will feel intimidated by the whole experience. But don’t coop yourself up in your room! Your dorm intentionally plans many programs the first week of move-in so you can be social and meet new people. You will have such a better experience when you put yourself out there, and you could possibly make lifelong friends! Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself and get to know other people.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki</em>: The best piece of advice I can give to a freshman moving into the dorms is to make an effort to get to know the rest of the people on your floor or building. Some of these people will be your best friends for life. Also, don’t forget to take it all in. Moving into your first college dorm can get pretty overwhelming, but as long as you remain optimistic and hopeful, you can definitely make the most of your time here.</p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some things freshmen often forget to pack when moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Get yourself some baby oil! Once you walk along the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara, you will learn about the sticky tar that is almost impossible to get off of the bottom of your feet. Baby oil does the trick, and it will save you the pain of scrubbing those toes forever!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> Freshmen forget to bring air freshener! Sometimes those rooms get smelly and no one wants to be “that room.” I know a lot of freshmen also forget to bring business attire, for job interviews and such. Last thing, stamps!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What are some belongings freshmen often move in with that won’t be useful?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshmen definitely do not need to bring a printer since UCSB offers 200 free pages a quarter at various printing labs. Check out the free resources your campus offers!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Don’t bring clothes you don’t need! When you go visit your family for breaks, you can switch out clothes for the different seasons. This will give you so much more space for you and your roommates!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen who don’t participate in the “party scene” get involved?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> RAs work really hard to plan programs weekly for residents to who don’t want to party. Residents can suggest ideas and even organize the programs with their RAs. If freshmen want to get involved, there’s SO MANY leadership and volunteer opportunities at UCSB such as Hall Council, RHA, Associated Students and various interest clubs!<br>\n<em>Isozaki:</em> There are plenty of organizations on campus that are excited and welcoming to new first-year members, ranging from activist groups to cultural groups to dance teams to video game clubs. Finding a job is a great way to get work experience, make friends and stay active. It’s also very possible to be involved in the party scene without drinking or doing drugs. The campus climate of UCSB is not about who drinks the most, it’s about having a good time.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki: </em>There is so much you can do. I think there is a strong misconception that every single person parties at UCSB, it’s definitely not true. There are so many student organizations that you can get involved in. If you log onto orgsync.com you can find a huge list of the many clubs and organizations we have on campus. Many of the RAs create programs that will have alternatives to the party scene. You will have many opportunities that will cater to your needs and interests.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen learn to get along with their new roommate(s)?</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is super important to have an open and honest discussion in the first few days you are there. Set some ground rules, and stick to them. There have been too many instances where one roommate doesn’t like something the other roommate is doing so they go ask their RA to fix it for them. When that happens, I don’t intervene until I know they have talked to their roommate about it. Also, being passive aggressive doesn’t work! Don’t do it. If you have a problem, try to be an adult and find a solution yourself. Also, sometimes it is just easier to let the small things go. If you have a mutual understanding and follow the rules you set at the beginning of the year, everything should be fine.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> I think the main thing is just to have respect for one another. Having healthy communication and remaining transparent whenever it is necessary definitely promotes a positive living environment. Try to make an effort to get to know your roommate(s). I suggest to go to programs your RA plans together or find a place to eat in Isla Vista that you both have not tried yet.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What’s a common mistake freshmen often make?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshman should take advantage of the fresh new start that college gives them. They should reach out to others, be open-minded and try new things. The person you were in high school does not have to be the person you are in college. You literally can reinvent yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Not buying a U-lock for one’s bike! We are a biking campus and having a U-lock helps keep your bike from getting stolen. Also, choose a major based on passion, not pay, because there are so many opportunities in every major to excel in great things.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Are there any other tips you would like to share with the class of 2019?</p>\n<p><em>Hunyh:</em> Set some academic and personal goals for yourself before starting college. Think about what you really want to achieve by the end of your first year and work towards it! It’s not bad to get lost or go with the flow, but make sure you’re always working towards something great!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is imperative that freshmen learn time management and remember to not put off studying until finals week! Meet your professors and hall directors, go to office hours and don’t be afraid to use all of the campus resources, because they are there for you!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Your freshman year goes by so fast! Take advantage of every single opportunity that comes your way. Remember to just breathe when things get tough. We have a wonderful community that will support your endeavors.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

have been on a full wildcat strike since last Monday Feb. 10, but have been demanding a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the form of a monthly stipend to alleviate high costs of housing since Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike is known as a wildcat strike because it is not approved by United Auto Workers (UAW) 2865, the graduate students’ union.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university did not meet the demands for a COLA of $1,412, hundreds of graduate students at UCSC voted in December to withhold over 12,000 undergraduate grades until the demands were met. When the graduate students went on a full strike last Monday, they refused to hold sections, grade or hold office hours in addition to continuing to withhold fall quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an open letter addressed to all faculty, staff and students, Napolitano said the contract between the university and UAW 2865 contains a “contractual promise” that its teaching assistants (TAs) would not strike while the contract was in effect, through June 30, 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the current contract allows for waived tuition, 3% annual wage increases, childcare subsidies, a one-time signing bonus and a remission of healthcare premiums. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership,” Napolitano wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling the wildcat strike “in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement,” Napolitano said the UC would not re-open the union’s current contract nor would it agree to a COLA in addition to the current contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end,” Napolitano ended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent a separate email on the same day to all UCSC faculty, informing them that graduate students who did not submit grades from Fall Quarter 2019 would be dismissed from TA positions for Spring Quarter 2020. Kletzer wrote that graduate students had until Feb. 21 to “submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations,” before facing consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments,” Kletzer wrote, calling it a “difficult next step that our campus must take.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her email, Kletzer also emphasized multiple times the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs on students, particularly our undergraduate students,” that the strike was creating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She urged faculty members to “speak with [their] TAs and advisees and encourage them to stop their unsanctioned strike and to submit the missing grades.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer noted that UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive had proposed two new initiatives in an effort to end the strike: creating support packages for up to five years for doctoral students and two years for master’s students, alongside a $2,500 annual need-based housing stipend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous interview with the Nexus, Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA), called the offers “insufficient,” and said they showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 15, UCSC’s GSA addressed Napolitano and Ketzler’s letters in an email to graduate students, telling the students not to submit their fall quarter grades before the GSA General Assembly meeting on Feb. 18, where they plan to discuss the termination threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a decisive moment in our struggle,” the UCSC GSA wrote in the email, noting that this was the first communication the graduate students have received from Napolitano regarding the strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the email, over 200 graduate students had received warning letters from the university for failing to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If hundreds of graduate student workers are terminated from employment, whole departments will be unable to offer courses next quarter, dozens of international graduate students will effectively face deportation, UCSC rankings will nosedive, huge sources of funding will be jeopardized, political organizing at other campuses will intensify, and UCSC may become subject to academic boycott (over 1,000 non-UCSC scholars and educators have already committed to a pledge of </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG2HqiSsC2XFFaT26e0YfGkRNo0LbIxQAiCxHoG12IlErlSw/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solidarity and non-cooperation with UCSC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In short, such a move would profoundly impoverish graduate and undergraduate education and research at UCSC, as well as its collaborations and partnerships with other research institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also noted that a poll taken in mid-January found that 715 graduate students were in favor of withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our readiness to escalate is profoundly unsettling for UC leadership,” the email continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union leadership at UCSB addressed Napolitano’s letter on Feb. 18 in an email to the UC Office of the President (UCOP), UCSC leadership and the COLA email groups at UCSC and UCSB. Sheila Kulkarni, the recording secretary of the UAW 2865 bargaining unit at UCSB, said in the email that termination of existing employment for spring quarter is a violation of </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Article 3 (Appointment Security), Section D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the agreement, an Academic Student Employee (ASE) can only be removed from a position when the student has become “academically ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University has no standing to terminate ASEs who have been promised employment in spring quarter,” Kulkarni wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be clear, if you are a TA who has been promised an appointment for spring quarter in any way, formally or informally, verbally or in writing, this statement from President Napolitano is in clear violation of your union rights… We are more than happy to help file grievances on behalf of our colleagues at UC Santa Cruz.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC COLA movement is calling on graduate students at other schools to begin striking as well, UCSB graduate students discussed in their most recent COLA meeting on Thursday.

floater just as time expired to give UCSB a 57-56 upset over Hawai’i.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the stunning victory in Hawai’i, the Gauchos (14-15, 9-7) leapfrogged the Rainbow Wahine (14-14, 8-7) into second place in the conference. Depending on how Cal State Fullerton and Hawai’i do in their games the rest of the week, UCSB can finish anywhere from second to fourth place in the Big West conference — a massive improvement from their eighth place finish last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hawai’i entered Wednesday’s game on a three-game losing streak, UCSB still entered the game as considerable underdogs, with the Rainbow Wahine a much stronger home team than away team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, UCSB proved from opening tipoff that it was going to hang around all night, with the team never trailing by more than one point all night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As has been the story all season, Lane put in yet another impressive outing for the ‘Chos, scoring 20 points on 10-14 shooting from the floor. To their credit, the Rainbow Wahine prevented Lane from grabbing her 19th double-double of the season, limiting her to only 5 rebounds on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UCSB won on Wednesday by producing one of its most efficient offensive performances of the season. The Gauchos shot 49% for the game, including 38% from deep; in total, the Gauchos scored 51 of their 57 points either in the paint or behind the arc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite facilitating far more than scoring this season, redshirt senior Coco Miller also carried a significant portion of the offensive load, chipping in 15 points and shooting 2-3 from deep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, Hawai’i kept the game competitive all night in front of its home crowd. Star senior guard Julissa Tago poured in 15 points for the Rainbow Wahine, although the Gauchos held her to 36% shooting on the night. With nine seconds to go and the Rainbow Wahine down 55-54, Tago was able to draw a shooting foul — converting both of her free throws to give Hawai’i an ephemeral lead. Redshirt junior Amy Atwell was the only other Rainbow Wahine player to notch double-figures on the night, with the Australian racking up 15 points on an efficient 7-9 shooting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of that was nullified by Miller’s late game heroics. Despite only scoring 9 points on the night, Miller hit one of the biggest shots of her career on Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the Gauchos must wait for the rest of the conference to finish their final games. At worst, UCSB is guaranteed a bye to the second round with the fourth seed; at best, the Gauchos are looking at a double-bye with the second seed. While a multitude of permutations exist, a Hawai’i loss to Cal Poly and a Cal State Fullerton loss to UC Irvine would guarantee UCSB the second seed in the conference tournament.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
