Senators Discuss Deltopia, Misallocated Funding","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting, senators and executive officers first discussed continuing efforts to deal with the ramifications of Deltopia and then voted to correct a mis...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting, senators and executive officers first discussed continuing efforts to deal with the ramifications of Deltopia and then voted to correct a mistake made in a previous meeting when they approved funding for Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) that broke financial code.</p>\n<p>News of the broken code was given by Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet, who informed the Senate that the previous meeting’s decision allowed SJP to receive A.S. funding for transportation for the second time that year, even though A.S. groups technically may only receive funding for transportation once per year. A discussion ensued to determine whether or not to correct the mistake — despite SJP members’ understanding that they would still receive the money — with the final decision culminating in taking back the funding.</p>\n<p>Before discussing the SJP fund issues, however, Executive Officers presented to the Senate the work their offices have been doing in light of the “civil unrest” that occurred Saturday evening of Deltopia, with senators later discussing potential strategies to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud devoted most of his speaking time to the matter of Deltopia and its repercussions. Abboud said the events were distressing, with bottles and rocks thrown at police personnel and then the police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets. However, he said A.S. reacted quickly to the incidents and that their response was well received by the general public.</p>\n<p>“The cool thing is that we were the ones sending out the message and not the university, so Associated Students was ahead of the game,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud also said most officials seemed open to working with students. In a meeting he attended with External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore and all of the Senior Officers of the university, he said officials looked to find a solution with the students rather than seeking to enact harsher restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We discussed just kind of what happened that weekend, and the tone of the conversation was surprisingly pro-student, and not, ‘Let’s just crack down,’” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said there would be a committee set up to assess the cameras that appeared in Isla Vista just before Deltopia, and he confirmed to Senators that the cameras were paid for by the university and were intended for temporary use only.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker also spoke about Deltopia during his report to the Senate. According to Whittaker, the most pressing issue for his office since Saturday has been that some students have been told by police that they could be evicted from their homes or expelled from UCSB based on their participation in the civil unrest.</p>\n<p>Whittaker said students can only be expelled if they engage in an act that “indicates a breach of the student code of conduct.” Eviction, he said, depends on specific lease agreements and would be left to the discretion of the landlord.</p>\n<p>Moore’s report discussed the reasoning behind requesting an investigation from the Civil Grand Jury on Saturday night’s events. Moore said he and other officers felt it was important to request a third-party investigation since no such circumstances of riots, tear gas and other events came up during previous Deltopias. Moore said he hopes the investigation can shed new light or a different perspective on the incidents that occurred last Saturday.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, we don’t have the answers … We’re looking to the Civil Grand Jury because it’s a fresh set of eyes,” Moore said. “We’re not looking to accuse anyone of anything, we’re just looking for answers, because we’ve had Deltopia for, what, a decade, and this is the first time this has happened.”</p>\n<p>Senators proposed potential actions that the community can take in order to prevent future events from spinning out of control. Ideas suggested included enacting parking restrictions, blocking entrances to I.V. or making Deltopia an official, sanctioned event that could potentially make it easier to regulate.</p>\n<p>After finishing the discussion about Deltopia, Senators went through details of the broken financial code in funding SJP. What initially occurred in the previous meeting was that the Student Commission On Racial Equality (SCORE) decided to allocate $250 for SJP for the group to transport a wall of photographs to the school. However, because SJP already received transportation funding earlier in the year in order to attend a conference, SCORE’S allocation broke code.</p>\n<p>Since Senate approved the allocation in their previous meeting, however, they had the power to choose not to correct the error and allow the group to keep the funding. A debate ensued on whether or not they should revisit the previous meeting’s minutes and correct the mistake.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator John Pena-Soriano said he felt Senators should allow the mistake to pass since the group had been operating under the assumption that they would receive the funding.</p>\n<p>“It seems like it’s really on us,” Pena-Soriano said. “I feel that it’s unfair for us to take away their funding now that we approved it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield disagreed with Pena-Soriano. Wakefield said he did not have anything against the group or their reason for requesting funding, but he said he felt that Senators should abide to the legal code regardless.</p>\n<p>“We have to follow policy, otherwise there’s no point in having policy in the first place,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Senators voted to strike the funding from SCORE’s minutes, thereby revoking their previous approval.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/","id":3027,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3026,3025,3024],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Associated Students Senate Discusses Deltopia and Installation of Security Cameras","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The first Associated Student Senate meeting of the quarter focused on a debate over the planned security measures for upcoming Deltopia festivities, particularly surrounding the controversy over recen...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The first Associated Student Senate meeting of the quarter focused on a debate over the planned security measures for upcoming Deltopia festivities, particularly surrounding the controversy over <a title=\"Sheriffs, UCSB Install Cameras Throughout I.V.\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/sheriffs-ucsb-install-cameras-throughout-i-v/\">recently installed public surveillance cameras in Isla Vista.</a></p>\n<p>Senators directed questions about the security measures to External Vice President of Local Affairs Alexander Moore after he provided his executive report to the Senate. Other items discussed at the meeting included the resolution to provide trigger warnings in classrooms to trauma victims that has garnered significant media attention, continuing improvements to the Isla Vista Pardall Center, plans for a professional drag show sponsored by the Queer Commission and confirmation that The Fire Department will be playing at Chilla Vista.</p>\n<p>Moore attempted to clarify police objectives regarding shutting down parties during Deltopia weekend in response to Senator Montana MacLachlan’s question asking what constitutes a “large party” in police terms. He said police personnel are not necessarily focusing on private house parties, but rather are concerned about large-scale, open-house gatherings or on-street crowding of over 500 people that can easily spin out of control.</p>\n<p>“They’re worried about the stuff that spills into the street or is totally public where there is no monitoring of who is coming in,” Moore said. “Those parties that you can just walk into — that’s what they’re trying to aim at, they’re basically trying to shut down stuff like that that’s uncontrolled.”</p>\n<p>Moore also said he advises party hosts to keep their music at relatively low levels to avoid receiving a citation for a noise ordinance violation. Unfortunately, according to Moore, there has been no stated decibel measurement of what constitutes as “low level” noise, so Moore suggests music players adhere to the rules from Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“I would stick to Halloween standards really, to be honest, as a precaution,” Moore said. “They make a judgment call when they decide to give you a ticket like that, so they’re not really able to tell us, which kind of sucks.”</p>\n<p>Moore then addressed concerns over newly-installed cameras in I.V. According to Moore, funds for the cameras were allocated by the university.</p>\n<p>“The security cameras are being paid for and provided by on the request of the university administration,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Senators continued to press for further information about the new surveillance measures. The lack of knowledge revealed that none of A.S. leadership was provided basic details of the new security measures that would be using school resources, such as who would operate and monitor the cameras, their costs or the duration of their implementation.</p>\n<p>Moore said he does not approve of the degree of secrecy with which the new surveillance measures were executed.</p>\n<p>“I think the way they put up the security should be more transparent,” Moore said. “There’s been no P.R. or attempt to explain what was going on… [and] all these things that are supposed to be part of a community discussion just didn’t exist.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the legitimacy as well as the pros and cons of the new security cameras, with Off-Campus Letters &amp; Arts Collegiate Senator Scott O’Halloran expressing approval of the cameras. O’Halloran cited recent incidents of assault and said the cameras could be a useful tool to track down suspects.</p>\n<p>“Instead of being uncomfortable with people watching you all the time, be like, ‘I’m uncomfortable because I just got assaulted and there is no justice for me,’” O’Halloran said. “It’s a serious thing. Maybe we should be less concerned with our privacy and more about somebody getting justice.”</p>\n<p>Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli delivered a rebuttal to pro-surveillance advocates, as he cited numerous studies of other surveillance systems, highlighting a controversial one in England. According to Khazaieli, the system in England showed that there was “no evidence that mass surveillance had reduced overall crime rates” and there was also “evidence of clear abuse” from police units to target minorities.</p>\n<p>“This is considered mass surveillance,” Khazaieli said. “Some of the other places that have implemented stuff like this include the U.K., Iran, Russia, Vietnam, East Germany and Bahrain. … Places that have implemented video surveillance have shown and proven that it’s actually not effective.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieili also said he stresses the importance of protecting I.V. citizens’ constitutional rights on individual privacy.</p>\n<p>“I think there needs to be a lot of definite rules and regulations set forth with this so that it doesn’t conflict with anybody’s Fourth Amendment rights,” Khazaieli said. “I think we should definitely take action on this.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion surrounding police security measures, Senate moved onto other topics, which included the restructuring of A.S. The restructure plan has been in the works for several months and faced several revisions, culminating in its passing on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Nearly 20 bills connected to the restructure were passed, creating major changes in the way the executive office operates. Such changes include eliminating certain positions of the president’s staff, consolidating others and reforming legislative boards and commissions. One restructuring bill authored by A.S. President Jonathan Abboud removed the powers of the A.S. president to select the editorial staff of <i>The Bottom Line</i> (<i>TBL</i>) newspaper.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the changes to <i>The Bottom Line</i> would make the paper more autonomous.</p>\n<p>“<i>The Bottom Line</i> will be moved under the press council, like the [Daily] Nexus is,” Abboud said. “They’ll still be something that A.S. funds through a lock-in [fee], but it won’t be something [to which] I could say, ‘Well, I don’t want this editor to be the <i>TBL</i> editor’ and not appoint them. That takes away that power of the president to manage the press. That was important for me to take out.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution authored by Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras establishing a committee to reevaluate the Isla Vista Master Plan in an effort to increase community influence on new building developments.</p>\n<p>It was also announced that students could bring their artwork to the A.S. Pardall Center to have it displayed publicly for one month free of charge, after which it would be returned to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54596\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54596\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/","id":3024,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3023,3022,3021],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Arbor ‘Springs into A.S.’ This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students has launched a five day-long campaign this week called “Spring into A.S.,” with A.S. representatives stationed at the Arbor from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. all this week to encourage st...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students has launched a five day-long campaign this week called “Spring into A.S.,” with A.S. representatives stationed at the Arbor from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. all this week to encourage students to learn more ongoing A.S. projects and how to get involved with student government, in light of A.S. elections happening later this quarter.</p>\n<p>From topics of environmental sustainability and recruitment to budgeting finance and student health, “Spring into A.S.” will inform students about the organization’s role on campus, while simultaneously offering free food and variety of goodies. The week-long series of events are also tabled in collaboration with Committee on Committees and a variety of their other Boards, Committees and Commissions (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Today’s event, “A.S. Open House,” will take place at the A.S. Main Office in the Multicultural Center and will offer attendees time to network with A.S. officials. Tomorrow will feature two finance-related events called “Where’s My Money?” and “Teach the Budget.” Finally, Friday’s event, “Student Health Day,” will take place on the SRB Lawn to talk about mental, physical and sexual health.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, the campaign was developed by the A.S. Office of the President. The week’s basic goal is to give students opportunities to learn about A.S. and decide whether it is a group they want to get involved in.</p>\n<p>“The project is to make visible all that Associated Students does and publicize Associated Students, get students more informed about where their money is going and what kind of activities we’re working on, especially before the election,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Monday’s event was “Sustainability Day,” which focused on the California drought as well as a number of other environmental issues in the county, especially regarding the coastline community of Santa Barbara. Members of the A.S. Office of the President, I.V. Tenants Union and Environmental Affairs Board also passed out reusable bags, pins supporting water conservation and free food from the I.V. Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>Megan Roy, a fourth-year environmental studies major and Outreach and Education Coordinator of UCSB Coastal Fund, said the Coastal Fund is an A.S.-funded organization that provides grants for conservation projects for the local coast.</p>\n<p>“There are students who work in different labs, like bio labs … that directly relate to our mission statement of protecting, restoring and enhancing the coast,” Roy said. “It’s really cool to see a student come in and propose their project. We can fund their projects and make them happen.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s event was the “A.S. Recruitment Fair,” and at tomorrow’s event, “Where’s My Money?” A.S. will be distributing surveys to garner student input about how students think A.S. should allocate its $10.6 million budget.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we make a new budget, and that is a time we ask to students what they think is important to fund in the budget,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Also taking place tomorrow at the Student Resource Building (SRB) Multipurpose Room from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. will be “Teach the Budget,” a presentation on California’s budget and issues surrounding the financing of higher education.</p>\n<p>“Spring into A.S.” culminates on Friday at the SRB lawn with “Student Health Day.” A bounce house, free candy, condoms and lube will be provided at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, Spring Quarter is when many opportunities open up in A.S. since all of the positions must be re-filled for the next school year. Some of these positions will be in the senate, executive office and BCCs.</p>\n<p>“All the positions in A.S. only last one year, so all 300-plus positions completely turn over every year,” Abboud said. “On top of that, they are employment positions. There’s probably close to 600 to 700 opportunities in A.S. total.”</p>\n<p>Aiden Brorsen, a second-year history of public policy major and Chair of the Committee on Committees, also said he believes now is an ideal time to start getting involved.</p>\n<p>“We are preparing students from spring to summer as opposed to just fall, so it’s kind of like a transitional event,” Brorsen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54551\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54551\" data-attachment-id=\"54551\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/the-arbor-springs-into-a-s-this-week/springas_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=3832%2C2833&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3832,2833\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367591152\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"185\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C656&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-54551\" alt=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt-250x184.jpg?resize=250%2C184\" width=\"250\" height=\"184\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Spring into A.S.” holds a number of events this week to encourage student involvement in allocation of funds and office positions.
