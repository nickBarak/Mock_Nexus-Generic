Four out of five starters from Los Angeles make up this extremely well-rounded team that should have chemistry right from the start. How much fun is Chris Paul going to have running the point for this team? — that is, until Kobe decides he wants a fifth All-Star game MVP and starts shooting (and making) fadeaway corner three-pointers with 20 seconds on the shot clock.</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Russell Westbrook (G, OKC Thunder), Monta Ellis (G, GS Warriors), Pau Gasol (F, LA Lakers), Kevin Love (F, MIN Timberwolves), LaMarcus Aldridge (F, POR Trail Blazers), Dirk Nowitzki (F, DAL Mavericks), Marc Gasol (C, MEM Grizzlies)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Kyle Lowry (G, HOU Rockets), Steve Nash (G, PHO Suns), James Harden (G, OKC Thunder), Danilo Gallinari (F, DEN Nuggets), Rudy Gay (F, MEM Grizzlies), David Lee (GS Warriors), Marcin Gortat (PHO Suns)</p>\n<p>It was hard to leave Lowry ­— who is having a huge breakout year — off the roster, but I just couldn’t give him the nod over Ellis, who seems to be overlooked every year. He could make the roster over one of the power forwards, and it would seem to be Nowitzki’s spot he would take. Dirk is having a down year for the Mavs, but I have to believe he will begin to turn it around. I think Nowitzki gets voted in partly based on his resume, and the fact that his team would be complete garbage without him.</p>\n<p>EASTERN CONFERENCE:</p>\n<p>GUARDS: Derrick Rose (CHI Bulls), Dwayne Wade (MIA Heat)</p>\n<p>FORWARDS: LeBron James (MIA Heat), Carmelo Anthony (NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>CENTER: Dwight Howard (ORL Magic)</p>\n<p>The East starters (and these will be the starters) might as well call themselves “The Monstars.” Five hall-of-famers, and five of the best eight players in the league make up the group. Can you say, fast break?</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Rajon Rondo (G, BOS Celtics), Deron Williams (G, NJ Nets), Ray Allen (G, BOS Celtics), Chris Bosh (F, MIA Heat), Josh Smith (F, ATL Hawks), Amar’e Stoudemire (F, NY Knicks), JaVale McGee (C, WAS Wizards)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Brandon Jennings (G, MIL Bucks), Jose Calderon (G, TOR Raptors), Joe Johnson (G, ATL Hawks), Andre Iguodola (F, PHI 76ers), Ryan Anderson (F, ORL Magic), Greg Monroe (F, DET Pistons), Tyson Chandler (C, NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>The East All-Stars were not too difficult to pick, apart from deciding who would back up Howard at center. The spot would normally belong to Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks, but he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last week. I decided to give the spot to JaVale McGee over Tyson Chandler and Spencer Hawes. Chandler has the name recognition (and will probably get the spot) and Hawes is in the midst of a breakout year for a breakout team, but McGee has the athleticism and motor to thrive off the bench for the East. After all, the All-Star game is all about entertainment, and McGee averages a league-leading 3.2 blocks per game, and a respectable 2.5 poster dunks a game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THOUGHTS:</p>\n<p>First off, look at those completely fake and totally not official starting lineups … And reserves, for that matter. WOW. The talent level in the NBA may be at an all-time high, and the days of Jamaal Magloire, Wally Szczerbiak and Mo Williams making the all-star team are clearly over. A young influx of superstar talent (Rose, Durant, Griffin, Love and Bynum) is currently fusing with an already thriving superstar crop (LeBron, Wade, Howard, Durant and Carmelo), while both groups battle with an aging class of all-time greats (Kobe, Allen and Nowitzki) who are refusing to pass the torch just yet. This All-Star game has the potential to contain as many as 12 hall-of-famers in it.</p>\n<p>The West has a much deeper team than the East, starting with its big men. This team may boast the conference’s scariest frontcourt since Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber and Dirk Nowitzki combined in their respective primes in the 2002 All-Star game.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the East holds an advantage in athleticism and speed. With several players to run the lanes — and Rose, LeBron, Rondo and Wade to feed them the rock — we are sure to see several highlight dunks. But highlights don’t win games (although maybe they should in the All-Star game).</p>\n<p>Final score: West 144, East 139</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/","id":791,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[790,789,788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush","biography":"Not available","articles":[721,733,736,737,740,754,756,757,759,761,764,774,780,783,784,787,788,791,792,793,796,799,800,806,810,811,813,821,822,824,834,839,841,907,1235,1736,1743,1745,1759,2282,2291,2301,2303,2789,2809,2826,2893,2895,2896,3496,5511,5515,5518,5522,5526,5527,5528,5532,5535,5537,5538,5539,5541,5545,5546,5553,5554],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Big West Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos With lofty expectations set for conference play, the UCSB men’s basketball team is off to a hot start after winning its first two Big West games.

Because of the team’s recent success, UCSB began this year on much of the country’s radar, receiving votes in the season’s first mid-major poll. Additionally, the Gauchos will be featured on national television as many as seven times during this regular season.</p>\n<p>While recognition on the national scene is nice, it all comes down to conference play for the Gauchos. UCSB received four first-place votes and was picked to finish second in the Big West in the annual preseason media poll released by the conference. Long Beach State (10-6, 3-0), whom the Gauchos beat in the Big West tournament championship in each of the past two seasons, was picked to win the conference.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really put any stock into these preseason ranking and awards,” Williams said. “It is all about being hungry, staying within yourself as you grow during the year you have a chance to achieve. We are highly motivated.”</p>\n<p>Facing Fullerton (10-5, 2-2) in the team’s home opener, UCSB got off to a slow start but behind solid defense, was able to coast to a 77-64 victory. In the team’s Big West opener on the road at Cal Poly (10-6, 1-2) last week, senior standout guard Orlando Johnson’s three-pointer miraculously bounced in with five seconds left to give the Gauchos a one point lead and decisive advantage. The win gave Williams, who is in his 14th season as head coach of the Gauchos, his 223rd career win.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make a statement on the road against a good Cal Poly squad to start off</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t exactly how we pictured it,” Williams said of Johnson’s bouncing three-pointer. “We were hoping to get Orlando going to the rim, but the defense forced him outside, and that was that…”</p>\n<p>With a preseason John R. Wodden Award, preseason Top 50 and Lute Olson Preseason All-American, Johnson leads the Gauchos with 20.4 points per game — good for first place in the Big West and 13th in the nation. After transferring from Loyola Marymount, the 6-foot-5 player was named the Big West MVP as a sophomore two</p>\n<p>seasons ago, and has led the league in scoring each of the past two seasons (including a Gaucho single-season record of 674 points last season).</p>\n<p>Johnson and Nunnally (16.5 points per game, fourth in the Big West) — both of whom were selected to the Preseason Big West All-Conference Team — form the best 1-2 scoring punch in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It helps us a lot,” Johnson said of he and Nunnally. “We are similar in a lot of ways — athletic, long, shoot the ball well … When one of us has an off-night, the other one is usually there to pick up the scoring slack. It’s something that other teams have to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s third returning senior starter is forward Jaime Serna. An All-Big West Tournament pick a year ago, Serna is currently third in the nation with a .692 field goal percentage while averaging 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I would certainly like to see Jaime get more shots up,” Williams said. “He is unbelievably productive, and when he’s active he is the best big man in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Mixed in with the experienced veterans are two key transfers and several freshmen that will be asked to make an immediate impact for the squad. Junior guard Keegan Hornbuckle, a transfer from Colorado, has come on strong as of late after returning from an early season injury. Junior guard Nate Garth, who was forced to sit out last season after transferring from New Mexico, has started nine games for the Gauchos, averaging 2.6 assists per game, as he and freshman point guard T.J. Taylor have split time at point guard.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently has an influx of youth on its bench, with seven freshmen on its roster. Coach Williams will decide which will redshirt as the season continues, as four have played so far on the season.</p>\n<p>“They have all acclimated pretty well,” Williams said of his freshmen. “They will all have to be big contributors for us at some point.”</p>\n<p>Nine different players have started a game for the Gauchos in this young season, and Coach Williams has no plans of slowing down his lineup changes. Based on the opponent and style of play desired, UCSB will continue to thrive on versatility, tweaking lineups to capitalize on advantages.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” senior guard Christian Peterson said. “We are a very versatile team.”</p>\n<p>Last season, in its quest to continue as regular season league champions, UCSB struggled in conference play and limped into the Big West tournament as a fifth seed. An improbable run to win the tournament sent the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tourney, becoming the lowest seed to do so since 1996. Despite a positive end result, UCSB is more focused this season.</p>\n<p>“We have learned from past experiences,” Williams said. “Off the court manifested on the court, and we weren’t cohesive or physically aggressive. It is all about how you continue to grow and improve as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opened up the season on fire, winning its first four games as part of a six-game stretch in November at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>However, arguably the team’s two toughest nonconference opponents yet were due into Santa Barbara next. On Nov. 26, UCSB suffered its first loss of the season in an overtime thriller to No. 25 San Diego State, a team that is slated to become a member of the Big West conference beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>Four days later, another ranked opponent — this time, No. 17 UNLV (15-2) strolled into Santa Barbara fresh off a win over No. 1 over North Carolina. With the rowdy Thunderdome home crowd behind them, the Gauchos battled all game behind Johnson’s 36 points and 10 rebounds, but eventually lost 94-88 in double overtime after a buzzer-beater tip-in from senior center Greg Somogyi forced overtime, and then a UNLV buzzer-beater three-pointer forced a second extra period.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on it, that’s all we can do.”</p>\n<p>With a 4-2 record in its pocket, the UCSB squad hit the road at the beginning of December for a four game 12-day road trip with games at USD, UWash, UC Berkeley and BYU — teams with a combined record of 41-24.</p>\n<p>“It was a great time for a road trip, right after finals. We love going on the road during that time of the year,” Williams explained. “It is a building and bonding time for the team.”</p>\n<p>The trip began positively after the Gauchos bested San Diego 65-61. Three days later at Washington, 24 points and 10 rebounds from Johnson was not enough as the Gauchos ran out of gas late, falling 87-80 to the Huskies. At Cal (12-3), UCSB struggled mightily in its most lopsided game of the year, falling to the Bears 70-50. UCSB ended its road trip with another close loss against a tough opponent in BYU (12-4). The Gauchos fought hard but were unable to pull the game to closer than seven late in the second half, as a season-high 19 turnovers limited the team’s opportunities.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this team knows it all comes down to conference play, and will use its tough nonconference schedule to learn and grow as a cohesive unit.</p>\n<p>“We are still evolving as a team,” Williams explained. “We are still trying to find ourselves in terms of our identity, but going forward we will have to be a team that doesn’t turn the ball over, defends hard and plays very unselfish. If we get those three things going, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Aware of what is at stake, the Gauchos are focused and grounded headed forward.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to just take it one game at a time and get better consistently,” Johnson said. “We want to put ourselves in the best situations and make sure we are on the right path to where we want to go … With the group we have I think will do a good job to not let this season take a bad turn … We want to make this year special, and be a Cinderella team.”</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State: 49ers</strong></p>\n<p>As the reigning No. 2 team in the conference for back-to-back seasons, it may have seemed surprising that Long Beach State would be ranked pre-season No. 1 in the conference. However with four out of five starters returning — including last season’s Player of the Year senior guard Casper Ware — the 49ers will bring back more experienced leaders than any other team in the league.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans have been through a lot of different parts of seasons, good and bad,” Head Coach Dan Monson said. “And we’ve had a lot of both. They’ve changed the Long Beach State program.”</p>\n<p>Forward T.J. Robinson, guard Larry Anderson and forward Eugene Phelps each received All-Big West honors last season, and join Ware as the core of the 49ers squad.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s preseason schedule this year was not only one of the toughest for a Big West team, but one of the most challenging in the nation amongst Division I schools. The 49ers faced perennial powerhouses North Carolina, Kansas, Louisville, San Diego State, Xavier and Pittsburgh, all of which made it to the NCAA tournament last March. CSULB was able to upset Pittsburgh and Xavier, each by a 10-point margin. For Monson, the rigorous preseason schedule is another step toward the goal of improvement.</p>\n<p>“My philosophy is that the preseason is to get yourself ready for the season,” Monson said. “It’s really hard for players or teams to know how good they are unless they play good teams.”</p>\n<p>CSULB is thus far undefeated through its first three games of Big West play after beating UC Irvine 74-60 on the road, Cal Poly 55-50 at home, then Cal State Northridge 81-68 at Northridge. Robinson currently averages a double-double with 12.5 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Ware ranks third in the league in scoring with 16.6 points per game, the highest average of any 49er.</p>\n<p>In each of its Big West championship appearances during the past two years, CSULB has suffered a defeat to UC Santa Barbara. With the return of four experienced seniors this season, Monson hopes to continue playing through March for the first time since 2007.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just losing to Santa Barbara … we didn’t play well in the [Big West] tournament,” Monson said. “[This year] we have the opportunity to compete for a championship.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>Projected to finish fourth in the preseason Big West conference poll, Cal State Fullerton is off to an impressive start in the 2011-12 basketball season, compiling a 10-5 record (2-2 Big West).</p>\n<p>The Titans, who finished sixth in the Big West last season with a 11-20 record (7-9 in the conference) are headlined by a trio of incoming transfers who have boosted the talent of the team tremendously.</p>\n<p>“It’s been terrific, I don’t know if I’ve ever had a team that gets along as well as these kids do,” nine-year Head Coach Bob Burton said. “They blend in very well; that was the difference of us winning 11 games last year and having 10 already at the halfway point. The difference has been the transfers.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Omondi Amoke, a transfer from UC Berkeley, has led the Titans in rebounding with 8.5 boards per game, good for second in the Big West. Amoke also ranks fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 11.5 points a game.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only given us good scoring, rebounding and defense, but a lot of leadership too,” Burton said. “The kids have appointed him the captain of the team unanimously.”</p>\n<p>Pacing the highest-scoring offense in the Big West have been a pair of junior guards in Kwame Vaughn and D.J. Seeley, transfers from San Francisco and Berkeley, respectively. Vaughn is second on the team with 15.3 points per game and leads Fullerton with over four assists a contest. Seeley meanwhile is the team’s leading scorer at 15.5 points a game on the season.</p>\n<p>Fullerton used a seven-game winning streak, the last two of which were in conference, to come into Big West play strong before dropping tightly contested matchups to UCSB and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We actually lost a couple of games I thought we should have won, but all in all I’m really happy with the preseason we had,” Burton said. “Starting 2-0 in league has really been great for us.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the starting five for the Titans are sophomore guard Isiah Umipig and senior forward Orane Chin, the most veteran player on Fullerton’s roster.</p>\n<p>Burton envisions his team playing tough down the stretch and competing for a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s feasible, but it’s going to be very difficult,” Burton said. “Obviously Long Beach and Santa Barbara are the two dominant teams in the league. I think in this league anything can happen. I think we have the capability to do it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Touting the Big West’s top defense in points allowed per game, Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6 record (1-2 in conference) entering the second week of conference play.</p>\n<p>Finishing last season second in the Big West at 15-15 (10-6 conference), the Mustangs were picked to finish third in the preseason conference poll.</p>\n<p>“Our number one goal: keep improving,” three-year Head Coach Joe Callero said. “If we keep improving, we feel like we have enough talent this year that we can be competitive and we have a chance to win the postseason tournament and get to the big dance.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs is senior forward David Hanson, a preseason Big West first team selection after garnering second team honors last year. Hanson currently leads Cal Poly in scoring at 10.9 points a game, while second on the team in rebounds, averaging over five a game.</p>\n<p>“The best part about David is that he is such a calm and confident guy,” Callero said. “He brings not just great play, but a great maturity and great poise, and that’s what you rely on out of your seniors.”</p>\n<p>While securing impressive road victories over Fresno State and USC, the Mustangs have fallen short against a number of top teams including two five-point losses to both DePaul and St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“We had five or six games against good if not great teams,” Callero said. “I think it has prepared us well. I think a lot of teams in the conference have played really good preseason games.”</p>\n<p>Conference play meanwhile has been cruel to Cal Poly with a 55-50 loss at Long Beach and a 58-57 defeat from UCSB at the hands of an Orlando Johnson last second three-pointer.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs rebounded with a win over Fullerton on Saturday for their first conference victory.</p>\n<p>“I think we would have liked the bounces to have gone a little bit better,” Callero said in reference to Johnson’s winning shot. “That always hurts. You win some games that way and you lose some games that way. The first two games we played very well, we just got pinched in the last minute of the game.”</p>\n<p>Playing important roles for the Mustangs this season are a pair of senior transfers from Hagerstown College in forward Will Taylor and point guard Amaurys Fermin. Both were eligible to play last season but were redshirted due to academic and health issues.</p>\n<p>Taylor is fourth in the conference with a team-high 7.8 rebounds per game while averaging better than 10 points a contest. Fermin meanwhile also averages over 10 points and is second in the conference with four assists per game.</p>\n<p>“It gives us a really true experienced point guard in Fermin and gives us another real aggressive rebounder and post up player [in Taylor],” Callero said. “They played junior college together so they have very good team chemistry too. They really know how to play well together.”</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside: Highlanders</strong></p>\n<p>There are few teams in the Big West playing as well as the UC Riverside Highlanders are right now. After stumbling out of the gates to a 1-4 start, they have won six of their last 10 games and sport a 7-8 (1-1 in conference) record early on in the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we got off guard a little bit,” Head Coach Jim Wooldridge said. “I think we all felt that since we had a number of returning players that we would have a better identity early on. We got humbled a bit, and then we started to realize what we had to do to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Like most coaches, Wooldridge pays little mind to preseason rankings. He knows that his team will face stiff completion from the rest of the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming into the season that Santa Barbara and Long Beach were the two best teams in the league, and then from there it is a mixture of teams,” Wooldridge said.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are lead by a pair of senior guards, Phil Martin and Kareem Nitoto, who lead the team in most statistical categories. They stand out most, however, in their contribution to the team’s offensive output. Martin leads the team with a whopping 242 points, 16.1 per game, and Nitoto is second with 151 points (10.1 per game). In comparison, the third highest scorer on the team has put up just 83 points.</p>\n<p>“They are critical to our success,” Wooldridge said. “If you look at our scoring, we’re somewhat limited in that department. If those guys play well offensively then it really gives us a chance to win ball games. We don’t have a whole lot of other options currently, so we have to rely on both of those guys to play that role for us.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lately reaped the benefits of junior guard Robert Smith, who transferred from Santa Clara this season and had to sit out the first several games due to the NCAA’s transfer rules. Even with the missed time he has put up nine points per game for a total of 72 points.</p>\n<p>“He’s changed our team,” Wooldridge said. “He’s helped us win a few ball games at home and on the road. He’s a talented young man. He’s brought a level of confidence to the other players on our team, because they know that they can rely on him to make plays.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders’ real strength, however, lies on the defensive side of the ball. They lead their opponents in steals and blocks per game and are +0.1 in the turnover margin. In order to succeed in a competitive Big West, they will need to continue their strong defensive play.</p>\n<p>“Well the numbers look pretty good right now,” Wooldridge said. “I think we can play better defense. I think that’s going to be the staple of this team. It is the only way we can consistently win ball games.”</p>\n<p>Though 1-1 is only a so-so start to the conference portion of their schedule, the Highlanders have the potential to contend for a Big West title. They enter conference competition playing well, and, with players like Martin, Nitoto and Smith leading the way, they have to potential to be a force to be reckoned with in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Defensively, [we need to] finish possessions get defensive rebounds [and not] allow second chance opportunities to creep into the ball game,” Wooldridge said. “Offensively, when we’ve been successful, we’ve had good balance; we’ve moved the ball; we share the ball; we get the ball into the lane.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are coming off a two-game road win streak and will now head home to do battle with UCSB and Cal Poly. Both are teams they must beat in order to contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team enters its fifth season in the Big West conference after finishing last season at the bottom of the conference table, finishing 10-20 overall and 4-12 in conference play. Led by new head coach, Jim Les, the Aggies have started this season on a nine-game losing streak, going 1-12 and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After coming off their worst season since entering the Big West conference, Les has the task of replacing most of its offense from last season including its top two scorers in Mark Payne and Joe Harden, as well as losing 49.5 percent of their assists and 48.9 percent in steals. With only two seniors on the team, the Aggies have struggled in finding consistency so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Right now we’ve been inconsistent with the guys we need to step up,” Les said. “We’re searching for answers in terms of guys that can replace that productivity. We need multiple guys to step up and play, and be more productive for us.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Aggies this season will be senior guard Eddie Miller who started all 30 games last season and finished second on the team in total steals (32) and third in scoring (12.5). Last year’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year, sophomore guard/forward Josh Ritchart is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 12.2 points per game and is team leader in blocks with 10.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will have to replace junior guard Ryan Sypkens who, before going down with a knee injury for the season was averaging 14.5 points per game. Head coach’s son, sophomore guard Tyler Les also appears to play a prominent role in the offense. Last year Les played in 25 games and shot 50 percent from behind the arc and is second in the league in three pointers (2.75).</p>\n<p>“[Tyler] is getting more playing time and he’s in a system and culture he’s comfortable with, and that’s allowing him to step up and produce,” Les said. “He’s a young player, he needs to continue to grow and get better. His work ethic in practice every day is allowing him to have success on game night.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies have had a rough start to the season where they have lost their last nine games including their first conference match against Cal State Fullerton. Davis’ offense ranks eighth in the conference with 62.5 points per game and are last in defense giving up 75.9 points per game, averaging 15.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>In his first year at UC Davis, Head Coach Les is trying to bring enthusiasm and relevance to the program by bringing in an up tempo and high scoring offense to the team, which is ranked second in the conference in three point field goal percentage (36.5), but has struggled in bringing in a tough, physical defensive mentality to the team.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten off to a rough start but I think we’ve made some strides,” Tyler Les said. “Defensively there’s a lot more intensity, a lot of ball pressure, it’s definitely helping us individually and as a team. If we play hard and bring it every night we should be at the top of the conference.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/","id":788,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[787,786,785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Team Effort Overcomes UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was a true team win for UCSB women’s basketball on Saturday afternoon when the squad knocked off UC Riverside 63-43 at the Thunderdome.

Underwood led the attack with 16 points while also contributing seven boards.</p>\n<p>“Coach has emphasized coming out early and setting the tone,” Underwood said. “I’ve obviously been struggling the last few games, so to be able to come out here tonight and play well, it feels great.”</p>\n<p>A 6-2 UCSB run to end the first half gave the Gauchos momentum, which UC Santa Barbara seized and used to gradually pull away.</p>\n<p>“Any run for us is good,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t satisfied, and I just told the team that we needed to win by 20 points. I knew for our mindset going into these next two road games that we had to win by 20 for our own benefit and mindset.”</p>\n<p>The 20-point win was the highest margin of victory for the Gauchos all year.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Kelsey Adrian put the team on her back in the second half, scoring 13 of her 15 points after halftime. She found her touch from behind the arc, knocking down three treys.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a mentality that we all have — that we’re going to keep shooting and the shots are going to fall,” Adrian said. “But, we weren’t just trying to shoot threes. It was getting to the basket, moving the ball around, and finding the open player.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit contributed nine points, all of which came in the first half. And then there was Emilie Johnson, who went without a field goal, but still left her mark with seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and no turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Highlanders 45-26 and gave up only one offensive board.</p>\n<p>“I threatened them on the day off — the one day to prepare — that we were just going to do all rebounding drills,” Mitchell said. “Maybe the reverse psychology worked on them, but we emphasize that every day.”</p>\n<p>For a team that has struggled offensively, UC Santa Barbara looked much smoother on the attack against UCR. Sixty-three points is well above the team’s average of 52 and was its second highest total of the year. They also shot 41.3 percent from the field and tallied 18 assists (a season high), while limiting their turnovers to just nine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos resume play next week with two tough games on the road against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/","id":789,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[788,787,786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Conference: Women’s Basketball Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West loo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>UC Santa Barbara:</strong> <strong>Gauchos</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West look ready to contend for another title.</p>\n<p>An adjustment period with new Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, whose team sits just below .500 at 6-7 with a 1-1 conference start, was to be expected.

We want to win.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish second, right behind conference foe Cal Poly. The two teams received the same number of first place votes, but Cal Poly received more points overall.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos weren’t thinking about the polls. They were concerned with adjusting and readying themselves for conference play. Their preseason schedule included some stiff competition, such as St. Mary’s and Washington State.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a great schedule,” Johnson said. “It was tough and it prepared us for conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began conference on the road, facing rival Cal Poly first. As expected, the game went down to the wire. A three-point play by senior guard Ashlee Burns with 2.3 seconds remaining left the Gauchos winless to start conference for only the second time in the last 17 seasons.</p>\n<p>A week later, Mitchell earned her first conference win as head coach against Cal State Fullerton 39-37, although it wasn’t the Gauchos’ best showing.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that hasn’t changed for the Gauchos this season, it’s their tenacious defense. UCSB allows opponents a mere 49.6 points per game, the best in the Big West and seventh in the nation. In eight of their past 10 games, their opponent hasn’t scored over 50 points. Furthermore, the Gauchos have held their opposition to 37 percent shooting, also first in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to try to outscore teams, but we’re going to try to make it hard on opponents on the defensive end,” Mitchell said. “That’s what I’m about and that’s what this program is about. We have to control what we can, which is defensive intensity.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, there is no apparent leader for UCSB. Certainly no player will be found atop the Big West rankings, but that is Mitchell’s strategy on offense: balance. UCSB has a deep team with many players who can make a difference.</p>\n<p>“Every player should have the confidence to be the go-to player if we need them to,” Mitchell said. “Then teams can’t focus on one player.”</p>\n<p>Currently, junior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team in scoring at 8.9 points per game. She is also second on the squad in rebounding at 7.8 per game, placing her sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets] has that ability to get a double-double every night,” Mitchell said. “Sweets understands we’re not asking too much for her and her athleticism.”</p>\n<p>While Johnson, who played for Team USA in October, has been inconsistent in finding her shooting touch thus far, she continues to lead her team by doing the less noticed things, like distributing the ball and getting steals. She leads the team in both categories with 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per contest, while still averaging 8.4 points.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Emilie] has to score for this team to be successful,” Mitchell said. “She’s such an unselfish player, and she understands it’s important to be a distributor and set the tempo. If she has five or six assists, that means 10 or 12 points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s other senior and captain, Kelsey Adrian, has recently found her stride in the new system, especially from behind the arc. The guard shoots 42.6 percent from three point land, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The two sophomore guards Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig have also proved themselves as offensive threats, averaging 8.6 and 8.2 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a good mix [of players],” Adrian said. “ We have some super athletic players and some shooters. We’re really complimentary of each other. We’re not as big as other teams, but we’re bigger and have bigger basketball IQs.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman cleans up the paint under the hoop night in and night out. She ranks second in rebounds in the Big West at 8.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Kirsten] is instrumental to our success so far,” Mitchell said. “She has to guard the other teams’ tallest and most physical players. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the effort and intensity every night.”</p>\n<p>As Coach Mitchell has preached all year, it most likely will be the little things that determine the Gauchos’ run for a title. Defense is their bread and butter, but rebounding and turnovers may make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding and limiting turnovers have been our keys all year long,” Adrian said. “We’re smaller, so blocking out is going to win or lose us games.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, Santa Barbara’s weakness seems to be consistent offensive production as they continue to work on executing on the offensive end. As a result, they score the least in conference at 51.1 points per game, but overall they still maintain the greatest scoring margin (+1.5).</p>\n<p>“We emphasize [defense],” Johnson said. “That’s been our identity: our toughness on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host UC Riverside this Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball went 3-9 and lost seven consecutive games entering conference play. They opened conference with two straight wins. The lesson: last year’s Big West co-champions and this year’s predicted league champs by the preseason polls should never be counted out of the mix.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and honored to be selected to win it, but we know we’re a long way off of that and know we have to earn it every single day,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “We had some really good competition in preseason and I think it’s prepared us all for the great competition we’re going to face in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs lost last year’s Big West Player of the Year, Rachel Clancy, they return with arguably an even more dangerous threat. Redshirt senior and 2009-10 Big West Player of the Year Kristina Santiago, who missed last year with a torn ACL, is back in action. Against San Diego State on Dec. 21, Santiago made the bold statement that she is completely back, tallying a career high 44 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have a different team, [which is] trying to put it together so we can have as successful a year,” Mimnaugh said. “Santiago is obviously one of the main reasons for that success. She is by all accounts an all-star and somebody that I’m sure the WNBA is having a really close look at as far as an addition to their league.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, the 6’1’’ forward has averaged 24 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Both statistics are good enough to lead the Big West and nationally rank her fifth and 17th, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Ashlee Burns is Cal Poly’s third leading scorer at 8.8 points per game. Opponents should watch out for her three-point shooting; she averages 36.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Ashlee Burns has been a terrific three-point shooter and somebody we count on to extend the defense so they can’t completely collapse on Kristina,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs are extremely strong offensively, preferring high scoring games. They lead the Big West, averaging 72.1 points per outing. The also lead the league in field goal percentage (42 percent) and assists (14.4).</p>\n<p>“We love up-tempo,” Mimnaugh said. “If we can score in the 70s, we’re usually on the victory side.”</p>\n<p>Consequently, Cal Poly also allows their opponents the most points in the Big West, so their game plan is simple: outscore the other team.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacific: Tigers</strong></p>\n<p>The University of the Pacific was picked to finish eighth in the Big West in the Preseason Media Poll, but already has almost as many wins as they did all of last year. The Tigers went 5-11 in conference play last season (9-22 overall) and entered the Big West Tournament as the seventh seed. There, they upset second seed UCSB in the first round before falling to first seed Cal Poly in the second round.</p>\n<p>This season, Pacific is currently in third place in the conference at 2-1 (8-6 overall). The Tigers went 6-5 through a tough nonconference schedule, including a trip to second-ranked Connecticut, and feel they are prepared for Big West play.</p>\n<p>“Now we get into the rhythm of conference play,” Head Coach Lynne Roberts told pacifictigers.com. “The Big West is going to be a close race. We know [each game is] going to be very tough.”</p>\n<p>In its first conference game against Cal State Fullerton on Dec. 29, Pacific won 72-67. In its next showing on Jan. 5 at UC Irvine, the Tigers lost in overtime, 77-75, but rebounded with a big win on Jan. 7, 80-59 at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there were indications that the Tigers were on track for an improvement from last year. On Dec. 5, junior guard Erica McKenzie was named Big West Player of the Week, and on Dec. 12, junior guard Ashley Wakefield earned the same award. McKenzie averages 12.4 points per game, and Wakefield is the team’s leading scorer at 12.6 points per game. On the defensive side, sophomore guard Gena Johnson is third in the conference in blocked shots with 1.4 per game.</p>\n<p>One area Pacific has found success is from behind the arc. McKenzie has made a conference-leading 34 three-pointers thus far this season, and junior Kendall Rodriguez leads the conference in individual three-point field goal percentage with .440. Overall, the team has the second-best three-point field goal percentage in the Big West with .344.</p>\n<p>Roberts hopes that the team can sustain these areas of success, which have contributed to its exceeding expectations so far.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is making sure our players understand we have momentum, but we’re not where we want to be yet,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team enters the season as defending champions of the Big West conference, after making a run in the conference tournament as a fourth seed and losing to Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament. With new Head Coach Jennifer Gross at the helm, the Aggies have started the season 8-5 overall and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After replacing 14-year Head Coach Sandy Simpson, who went 24-9 overall and 10-6 in conference in his final season, new Head Coach Jennifer Gross is trying to bring a fast, up-tempo offense to the team, as well as a tough and physical mentality to both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Although I am in my first year as the head coach at UC Davis, I have been a part of this Aggie program for the past eight years,” Gross said. “Of course, I have my own style as the head coach, but the overall philosophy of our program will remain the same.”</p>\n<p>This season the Aggies are led by their three senior captains. Senior guard Samantha Meggison started all 33 games last season, leading the team in steals with 61 and finishing second on the team with 66 assists. Meggison is leading the Aggies in points with 10.8 points per game and rebounds (4.5). Senior guard Hana Asano is averaging seven points and 3.5 assists per game. Senior forward Kasey Riecks is second on the team, with 10.2 points per game and is on pace to become the 15th Aggie to reach 1,000 career points.</p>\n<p>“Three of our seniors, Samantha Meggison, Kasey Riecks and Hana Asano have been very consistent so far,” Gross said. “Whether it is scoring, rebounding or getting us stops, they have been providing great leadership and have been very productive on the court.”</p>\n<p>After five straight wins to start the season, the Aggies have cooled off and are now 8-5 and 0-1 in conference. Davis is averaging 62.9 points per game, ranking sixth in the conference in offense, including a league-leading 7.6 threes per game, ranking them 14th in all of Division I. Defensively, they are only giving up 63.6 points to their opponents, forcing 19.9 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Gross is focused this year on building strong relations and competing as a unit, fielding a team that can be competitive night in and night out in a very even conference that is up for grabs. The Aggies’ goal for the season is to continue growing throughout the next few months and coming as close as possible to reaching their potential.</p>\n<p>“We have big picture goals like trying to go back to the NCAA tournament,” Riecks said. “But there’s a lot of goals within our team that we want to accomplish through each game, and its getting better every game, and the opportunity that we have to be on the court during practice is amazing.”</p>\n<p><strong>CSUN: Matadors</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team has already seen success this season, sitting at 8-7 overall and 3-0 in the Big West. Last year, the Matadors suffered through a 4-26 overall (4-11 Big West) season. Thus far, Northridge has defeated Irvine, Riverside and Long Beach to stand in first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by senior center Jasmine Erving, who averages 14.7 points per game and has started all 15 games so far, alongside freshman guard Ashlee Guay.</p>\n<p>Erving earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award the week of Nov. 28. She posted two consecutive double-doubles against Colgate and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, freshman guard Janae Sharpe also took home the Big West Player of the Week award, bringing CSUN women’s basketball its second of the season. Sharpe scored 19 points and had seven steals against UC Irvine, leading Northridge to its first league win of the season.</p>\n<p>In steals, Northridge only ranks behind Long Beach this season, partly due to freshman guard Ashlee Guay, who leads the team with 55. She and Sharpe, who has 29 steals, get the ball back for their offense and feed leading scorer Erving. Both Guay and Sharpe have 57 and 36 assists respectively.</p>\n<p>Northridge will face Pacific on the road and Cal Poly at home before facing Santa Barbara at home on Jan. 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>After posting a 6-5 nonconference record, Fullerton has opened its Big West season by going 1-3.</p>\n<p>The Titans lost a close game at Pacific in its Big West opener 72-67, despite a fourth consecutive 20-point effort from senior guard Megan Richardson. Fullerton then upset UC Davis 58-50 two days later, and returned home 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>In the team’s home opener, four different Titans tallied double digit points, but Cal Poly won 76-69. On Saturday, Fullerton played host to visiting UCSB, who escaped with a narrow 39-37 victory.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marcia Foster will be patrolling the sidelines in her third season with Fullerton, who a year after posting a 9-21 (5-11 Big West) overall record, was tabbed to finish fifth in the Conference Preseason Media Poll.</p>\n<p>Richardson was named to the preseason All-Conference team and is the squad’s returning leader in minutes per game (32) and points (14.7). Other returning starters include redshirt senior point guard Lauren Chow and sophomore guard Alex Thomas.</p>\n<p>An indication of Fullerton’s success may be how the team fares away from the friendly confines of Titan Gym. Last year, Fullerton was 3-14 on the road, including 2-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43526\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43526\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/","id":790,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[789,788,787],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
