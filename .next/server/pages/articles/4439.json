But our job is to just play the game of baseball and do our best to win every game and let that stuff take care of itself.”</p>\n<p>While holding those rankings, and with the tough preseason ahead in mind, the Gauchos will start their season’s journey with BYU this weekend. Last season, UCSB played a solo game against BYU, charting a 9-5 win over the Cougars, holding the team to only seven hits and four errors.</p>\n<p>Finishing 22-31 last season, the Cougars retained 16 upperclassmen for the 2015 season, while adding 10 freshmen to their lineup.</p>\n<p>“I feel really confident about the Gauchos going into the opening weekend against BYU,” Woodward said. “Our goal had been to focus on the process and get better everyday we step on the field. Going into this weekend I think we are in a great place.”</p>\n<p>This season, the Gauchos are once again bringing to the mound junior right-handed pitcher Dillon Tate. During this preseason, Tate has most recently been chosen as a Preseason All-American by Baseball America and also received two other Preseason All-American Awards over the off-season by both Perfect Game, and Collegiate Baseball.</p>\n<p>Last season, Tate recorded a 1.45 E.R.A. with 12 saves and 46, strikeouts while allowing only 17 total walks which earned him a spot on the 2014 All-Big West second team.</p>\n<p>While experience is a major strength of this season’s Gauchos, the team has also found new prospects in its incoming freshmen.

The win marked the first road victory against the Bruins since 2011 and the program’s first win against a defending champ since 1999.</p>\n<p>In that game, Santa Barbara had a solid outing from sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza who went into the sixth inning allowing only two runs to the potent Bruin offense. UCSB also benefitted from timely hitting by junior infielders Tyler Kuresa and Pete Maris who each went deep: Together they accounted for five of UCSB’s six runs in the game.</p>\n<p>So far in the season, the Gauchos have relied on its bullpen to get them out of trouble in late game situations. Sophomore Dillon Tate has converted on both of his save opportunities and junior Greg Mahle is developing into a reliable setup man for Tate. Before Tuesday’s game, the bullpen came in with a 2.40 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been on an offensive tear as of late, as it has put up a combined 16 runs in its past two games. Senior third baseman Joey Epperson has excelled at the top of the lineup and leads the team with a .450 batting average, while Kuresa has been the Gaucho’s power hitter with two homeruns in five games.</p>\n<p>In its first game of the season, Princeton enters looking to improve on last year’s 14-28 finish where the team was mostly hurt by its fielding errors; the Tigers had the most in their conference with 74.</p>\n<p>Although being among the middle of the conference in batting average and ERA last season, the Tigers return players capable of becoming big threats this season. Senior infielder/outfielder Alec Keller batted .378 with four homeruns and will be counted on to lead the offensive production for the young Princeton squad this year.</p>\n<p>Another potential threat in the lineup of the Tigers is sophomore infielder Danny Hoy who managed a .307 batting average to go along with 21 RBIs and two homers.</p>\n<p>On the mound, sophomore Cameron Mingo will have to step up for the Tigers after the loss of their two best pitchers from last year. The right-handed pitcher posted an ERA of 2.92 and 1-4 record last season and is one of the best prospects in the Tiger’s conference.</p>\n<p>Friday’s opening game at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium is scheduled for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/","id":4437,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4436,4435,4434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot Bats Power UCSB Sweep of Princeton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-4VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-4VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB outscored Princeton 38-11 this weekend, as the Gauchos' three-game sweep improved them to 7-1 on the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not even the weather can cool down the UCSB baseball team’s hot start.

UCSB clinched the game with five runs in the seventh inning to win 11-0 after the game was called off one inning early.</p>\n<p>“We put some quality hits together and put on a hit parade,” junior infielder Woody Woodward said. “The coaches did their homework on the guys they were going to throw and we just went up there with a plan and stuck to it.”</p>\n<p>The first game of the doubleheader was a slugfest with weather conditions matching the play on the field. UCSB fell behind after a Princeton five-run inning in the top of the second inning, but scored four runs of its own in the bottom half to lead 6-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht was chased from the game after allowing runners to reach second and third base in the third inning; Hecht was charged with seven runs, five earned in 2.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>The usually dependable UCSB bullpen did not fare better and tacked on four runs in the inning. However, the Gauchos broke the game open in the seventh inning, exploding for five runs to break a 10-10 tie. UCSB added on to the lead in the following inning to take the game 18-10.</p>\n<p>“We were sloppy in the field and I think we finally were able to get going,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That was like a bad football game; our guys plugged away and we found a way to win ugly.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Justin Jacome pitched one of his best games in the series opener on Friday. The lefty threw seven innings of shutout ball and struck out a career-high seven batters to pick up his first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Setting the tone early by striking out five of the first six hitters faced, Jacome took a no-hitter into the fifth inning before being broken up. Jacome faced the minimum in what was his second time in his career shutting out the opposing side as starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>“Our pitching staff is fantastic and we have all really good guys. There’s no drop off between the first, second and third guy,” Woodward said. “It’s a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game open in the sixth inning after already leading by two runs. The Gauchos jumped on the new relief pitcher after two batters reached second and third base.
