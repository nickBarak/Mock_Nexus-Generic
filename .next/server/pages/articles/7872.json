Before, your lungs were fully immersed in fluid, but your body was now introduced to an alternate input: oxygen. You desperately respired, admitting this new substrate into your body. And there it was.

You found new perspectives, new friends, new ideas. You probably also took a similar approach to education. Constantly learning, collaborating and always desperate to take in that one extra fact. Supplementing that everyday t-shirt weather, breezy walk to Campus Point or surf break in between classes, these past few years were filled with constant learning and as a result, newfound wisdom.</p>\n<p>I never fathomed this day would finally come, especially as fast as it really did. Class of 2013, we made it.</p>\n<p>When it’s finally over and Chancellor Yang bestows our well-deserved diplomas on that stage with thousands of spectators, many of us will wake up the next day with a feeling of emptiness. A cue for those unsettling questions: “Where should I go? What should I do? Why should I do it?” It’s bound to happen, and you’re certainly not alone.</p>\n<p>I personally recount many nights I contemplated dropping out. Hell, if Jobs, Gates and Zuckerberg managed to get away with it, why couldn’t I? But there’s something about staying at this place that evokes progress … evokes purpose … evokes meaning.</p>\n<p>Then, we got to I.V. We enjoyed many a late-night Freebirds run, sloppy Bill’s Bus ride or embarrassing karaoke performance at OTT. Memories from those amazing I.V. nights will be with you for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>And here we are, on the brink of graduation. For some of us, this is the end of our road to education. Don’t fall into this trap. It’s naive. It’s ignorant. It’s unintelligent. This is just the beginning. Not even cliché. It’s true.</p>\n<p>We are the next generation of leaders. We are sophisticated. We are tech-savvy. We are accepting. And we are still young.</p>\n<p>The past few years here have been eventful for sure. In my last year here, I lost the first friend I met my first year living in FT (Santa Catalina), who tragically passed away last November. It was the first time I had cried in years. But if there’s one thing he taught me, it’s that we should seize every waking moment.</p>\n<p>As we transition into the daunting “real world,” let’s hold onto a couple things:</p>\n<p>• Don’t lose your childlike curiosity. As Gandhi once put it, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”</p>\n<p>• Share your opinions. Life is too short to safeguard them. Be open-minded to different perspectives and constantly change your own.</p>\n<p>• Be inspired and inspire others. Don’t lose the relentless motivation that powered you through college in the first place.</p>\n<p>• Don’t lose contact with those that truly made a difference. Every so often, remember to let them know you care about them.</p>\n<p>• Relish your past but look forward to your future. Sure, cherish your memories, but also look ahead to all the precious things life will have in store for you.</p>\n<p>To my fellow graduates: Good luck to all of you. I earnestly hope you find success and happiness. We have undoubtedly changed and become better through our collegiate experiences.</p>\n<p>One more thing, continue to treat your life serendipitously. Stop taking the path that you felt has been assigned to you. Create your own journey from here on out.</p>\n<p>Peace out, Gauchos. I’ll see you all next April for our first reunion.</p>\n<p><em>Kiyan Rajabi has been the Health &amp; Wellness columnist for the past two years.

Cocaine has had a tumultuous history and continues to be one of the most consumed and demanded drugs to cross U.S. borders. But what is it and why is it so controversial?</p>\n<p>Cocaine is a substance that comes from the <em>erythroxylum coca </em>plant that grows in South America. The leaves have been used since the 17th century for medicinal purposes and many workers still chew it today to alleviate hunger pains and elevation sickness. To turn the coca leaf into the powdery substance most of us recognize, the leaves undergo a multistep chemical process. The coca leaves are soaked in gasoline and other chemicals including ammonia and sulfuric acid, filtered and heated to produce the powder or crystal form of cocaine hydrochloride. The cocaine is then distributed, most often via drug cartels, to countries all over the world. According to Business Insider, almost all of the world’s cocaine supply is made in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia. Obtaining pure cocaine, however, is not guaranteed. Some of these chemicals include caffeine, designer drugs and meth.</p>\n<p>“It is very, very, very, <em>very</em> rare that you get cocaine pure, so students are unaware often what they’re taking and that’s what causes a lot of risk and problems, because cocaine is often cut with many, many harmful chemicals,” Lacey Johnson, counselor and educator for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program, said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the consumer level, how does cocaine affect the brain once in the body? Cocaine can be administered in several ways: absorption through nasal tissue (snorted), diluted into water and injected or — if the crystal substance is obtained — smoked. Once in the body, cocaine takes over the part of the central nervous system that is responsible for rewarding us with the feel good chemical, dopamine, released when we do things such as eat, drink or have sex. Normally, dopamine crosses gaps between nerves and receptors at regulated levels and then returns to the original nerve cell to be reused later. Cocaine increases dopamine levels by 400 to 800 percent above normal levels. It also blocks the dopamine from returning to the nerve cells that released it, so dopamine builds up very quickly, giving users a feeling of euphoria, happiness and alertness.</p>\n<p>While the high of cocaine feels really good, it does not last very long. Cynthia Kuhn, author of <em>Buzzed: The Straight Facts About the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy,</em> writes, “liver and blood enzymes degrade about half of a cocaine dose in about an hour. This means that a user is usually ready for another dose in about forty minutes or less.”</p>\n<p>“After people do coke, usually people felt so, so good that now that the [reward-pleasure pathway] factory has depleted what it has so people will feel depressed and irritable because there’s nothing there to help you,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>On its own, cocaine has many risks, including damage to brain cells, seizures, constricted arteries, vascular disease, damage to the nose and risk of addiction. Heavy users are susceptible to strokes, brain bleeds and memory and thought deficits. When alcohol is added to the mix, as it often is, a whole new compound is created that has more adverse effects. Alcohol and cocaine create a highly toxic chemical in the liver called cocaethylene that increases the likelihood of an early heart attack or sudden death. In addition, cocaine masks the effect of alcohol, which leads to higher BACs.</p>\n<p>“People will be drinking and feel really drunk, and then they’ll do a line and think ‘Oh, I don’t feel as drunk anymore, I can have another beer,’” Johnson said. “Really, they’re just as drunk — nothing has changed in their blood, but they don’t feel as drunk so they tend to drink more and their BACs climb. Also, mixing alcohol and cocaine speeds up the metabolism, so alcohol reaches the brain faster.”</p>\n<p>The drug is often part of the “work hard, play hard” mentality that is popular among many college campuses.

Your mind is cleared from the clutter of your busy day; you’re calm and there is an equal boost of energy with every pose and breathing exercise. Finally, you lie down into savasana and the weight of the world you thought you had on your shoulders is gone. You come out of that class feeling mentally and physically healthy, peaceful and strong enough to take on the world — or at least a long night of studying.</p>\n<p>Many people go to yoga classes hoping to get a toned physique through countless vinayasas, stretches and even inversions. But yoga goes far beyond just a way of getting your daily exercise. It is a lifestyle deep-rooted in history that is meant to heal the body and mind. The purpose of every pose, or asana, is to help the mind and body inch closer to health and well-being.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sachin Deshmukh, a Panel Expert and consultant for the Integrated Wellness Center of America, gave an overview about the foundational aspects of yoga.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Yoga is a way of life and it is based on universal principles which are beyond religions, cultures and gender,” Dr. Deshmukh said. “It emphasizes interdependence of the mind and body, and asserts that mind has a far more profound influence on body than that of body on mind. Some traditionally recognized benefits of yoga are that it improves concentration and creates self-awareness.”</p>\n<p>Yoga heavily impacts the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which are part of the autonomic nervous system. ANS regulates daily bodily processes, such as urination, digestion, salivation and sexual arousal. The ANS controls the fight-or-flight response, an automatic reaction to a harmful effect on the body and maintains homeostasis.</p>\n<p>Manoj Joshi, Founder and Director of Wellness By All Means, said that yoga uses body channels as sources of energy. Ida Nadi is associated with left nostril breathing, while Pingala Nadi is associated with the right.</p>\n<p>“Yoga mentions Nadis, subtle channels of prana or life force or vitality. The Ida Nadi and Pingala Nadis are associated with the left side and right side of our sympathetic nervous system [respectively],” Joshi said. “With the balanced breathing techniques it is possible to bring balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and activate the central nervous system. This creates a state of homeostasis or state of equanimity and a balanced state of mind.”</p>\n<p>When you activate the PSNS and SNS, your brain and body feel the effects. Slow, deep movements, holding poses and deep breaths benefit the PSNS to overall reduce stress in the body. During PSNS activation, the mind and body are relaxed; you become aware of stress-inducing thoughts and respond to them better. On the other hand, vigorous exercises, such as sun salutations or deeper stretches, activate the SNS. Yoga that incorporates stretches and breathing techniques to first activate the SNS and then the PSNS is the best for a more well-rounded and balanced practice.</p>\n<p>Yoga increases blood flow to the organs essential for survival and helps to remove toxins. When the body is cleansed the neurons and other cells function better.</p>\n<p>The American Heart Association and Mayo Clinic say that practicing yoga can reduce or even treat the effects of cardiovascular disease. The American Medical Association suggests that it could help with carpal tunnel syndrome, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine are investigating its affects on lower back pain, multiple sclerosis, insomnia and other chronic diseases.</p>\n<p>So, next time you are in savasana and practicing your mindul breathing, think about peace replacing the stress and hectic years that have injured your body. Live the yoga lifestyle to achieve utmost health and well-being.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Wednesday, January 29, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/","id":7870,"author":{"id":1035,"name":"Priyanka Shindgikar"},"related":[7869,7868,7867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Harvard Happiness Study Analyzes Keys to a Lifetime of Joy","category":"Science & Tech","subcategory":"Health & Wellness","publish_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With graduation fast approaching and our days of care-free living slipping away, many of us have pondered the age-old question, “What makes us happy?” Contrary to what we’ve been led to believe,...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With graduation fast approaching and our days of care-free living slipping away, many of us have pondered the age-old question, “What makes us happy?”</p>\n<p>Contrary to what we’ve been led to believe, it is not the result of following a set formula guaranteeing happiness.

The unhealthiest of responses he referred to as “psychotic adaptations,” which are found in the mentally ill and are characterized by paranoia and hallucination as the unconscious mind’s attempt to “create a reality tolerable for them,” Vaillant said. The next highest up, “immature adaptations” are responses such as passive aggression, projection and acting out. Socially normal people employed “neurotic defenses,” which, according to Vaillant, include “intellectualization, repression and dissociation.”</p>\n<p>The “healthiest adaptations” turned out not to be defenses but abilities to turn undesirable circumstances into beneficial ones. Such strategies were common in “anticipation, humor and altruism.” It’s these qualities that form the foundation of the most rewarding personalities.</p>\n<p>What separated those who viewed themselves as truly happy from those who did not was not in the events that made up their lives — it was in how they responded to those events. The key difference between the happy person and the unhappy one was that one viewed themselves as a victim to their circumstances, while the other sought ways to use it to their advantage. The degree to which happiness was attained was in the adaptations the participants employed to deal with and shape their reality.</p>\n<p>Vaillant also identified “education, stable marriage, not smoking, not abusing alcohol, healthy weight and exercise” as the six major factors that lead to healthy and happy aging.</p>\n<p>According to Vaillant, exercise plays a major role in regulating contentment as we age, important not only physically but mentally as well.</p>\n<p>“Regular exercise in college predicted late-life mental health better than it did physical health,” Vaillant said. “Of the men diagnosed with depression by age 50, more than 70 percent had died or were chronically ill by 63.”</p>\n<p>Yet of all these factors that influence lasting happiness, there was none quite as indispensable as the “power of relationships.” Underlying the foundation of relationships is perhaps the most valuable and most human adaptation: altruism.</p>\n<p>Our desire to advance those around us without the expectation of anything in return provides us with a happiness rooted in unselfish adaptation. It is through altruism that we are enabled to extend our legacy beyond ourselves and make the outcomes of our efforts limitless. Although it requires vulnerability, it also promotes similar altruistic happiness within those you associate with.</p>\n<p>According to Vaillant, contentment arises from taking risks to form deep relationships with others over superficial ones that prevent us from getting hurt.</p>\n<p>“Positive emotions make us more vulnerable than negative ones. One reason is that they are future-oriented. Fear and sadness have immediate payoffs — protecting us from attack or attracting resources at times of distress,” Vaillant said. “Gratitude and joy, over time, will yield better health and deeper connections, but in the short-term actually put us at risk.
