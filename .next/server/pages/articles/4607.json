Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V. Teen Center), which co-hosted the event with Future Leaders of America (FLA), a local nonprofit that works with low-income Latino/a youth.</p>\n<p>“As youth, we want to reduce drugs and alcohol and drug consumption in I.V.,” said Oscar Rojas, 16, a sophomore at Dos Pueblos High School and a member of FLA. “We believe that the best way to deal with these issues is to work as a collaborative team with UCSB, SBCC, the County of [Santa Barbara] and community nonprofits and our families.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70450\" style=\"width: 373px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70450\" data-attachment-id=\"70450\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/student-survey-by-nicholas-bogel-burroughs-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Student Survey 4/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70450\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=363%2C272\" alt=\"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs / Daily Nexus\" width=\"363\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More than 30 students from schools around Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of Isla Vista on Tuesday. <em>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Leonor Reyes, director of the St. George Family Youth Center, said the “general party culture” blinds some students to the families living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I work with a lot of college students who come in [the center] and it’s the first time they realize there are students and teens in Isla Vista,” Reyes said.</p>\n<p>The student group recommended three means by which to alleviate the party culture that, at times, hinders students from focusing on homework or falling asleep.</p>\n<p>First, make I.V. residents aware of children and teens who live and study within the community; second, increase the media coverage of positive I.V. activities; and third, add classes or programs to UCSB’s curriculum that educate students on the composition and history of the area.</p>\n<p>Eder Gaona-Macedo, the executive director of FLA, proposed the creation of “cultural sensitivity training” for UCSB students during freshman orientation, telling them that there are families in I.V. and that “the party isn’t conducive to everyone, especially the young kids.”</p>\n<p>Nicole, 15, was born and raised in I.V. and now attends Dos Pueblos High School. She said the noise is the most difficult part of living in I.V., adding that she often sees people smoking and drinking at a park near her house, although the problem is improving.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I’m not able to go outside to enjoy the park,” she said. “I hope it gets better. It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

IV Drip created a Blunite cookie and Woodstock’s Pizza will be selling blue beer.</p>\n<p>Faria, who was at UCSB at the time of the shooting, said students must remember that families in I.V. remain even while thousands of students leave each year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70971\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70971\" data-attachment-id=\"70971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-14/blue-lights-in-peoples-park-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy/blunite-prep-jenny-luo-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Blunite Prep\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70971\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=368%2C245\" alt=\"People's Park will be glowing Saturday night as attendees can expect carnival games, prizes and lives DJs.

We want to make sure that this is something that would be able to be commemorated and celebrated after all of the classes leave.”</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, a transfer student, said seeing the community come together after the tragedy was a big reason why he chose to transfer to UCSB. Collins hopes Blunite can help bring students together who may not normally interact.</p>\n<p>“It’s more than just the tragedy,” Collins said. “It’s more about uniting, and that’s what Blunite is about: the uniting, more than anything, of people who never come in contact with each other.”</p>\n<p>Collins, who was breathing heavily Friday after carrying giant cinder block stands from UCSB’s Theatre Department to People’s Park, said it would be hard for students to miss the park on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>“If you’re in IV, you’re going to know that there’s something going on,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Upcoming meetings will discuss the permit exclusivity for I.V. residents, showing proof of residency for permits and UCSB’s responsibility in addressing the issue. The next parking permit meeting will be held on Sunday, Nov. 22 at 4 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Building.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Bruce Murdock said he estimates around 30 to 40 percent of people who park in Isla Vista are students and faculty using the town as alternative campus parking.</p>\n<p>“The number of people that go to UCSB, both faculty and students, don’t want to pay the fees to park on campus so they come and park in Isla Vista,” Murdock said. “They are people that are from the outside and parked there so they can go to the campus.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car. How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?<br>\n<em>– I.V. resident Bruce Murdock</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I.V. resident Peter Neushul said the amount of parking in I.V. does not coincide with its resident population.</p>\n<p>“The new towers and new villages going up are going to have staff and those staff are going to want to park for free in our town,” Neushul said. “So it has to be looked upon as it is something that is just going to get worse and something that now encircles the entire Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the demand for street parking will decrease if property owners lower in-unit parking fees.</p>\n<p>“If we could make it so that the landlords that are providing parking weren’t charging extra for parking … that would lessen some of the load on the on-street parking,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said landlords cannot alleviate the issue by lowering fees because there are not enough parking spaces on the properties.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got an apartment that has 30 students and you have 10 parking places you can pass all the laws you want and write all the reports you want, you’ve still only got 10 parking spaces,” Murdock said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66502\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66502\" data-attachment-id=\"66502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/parking_by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447611919\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parking Commission Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66502\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1-250x166.jpg?resize=350%2C232\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Murdock also said many I.V. residents who have access to parking garages fail to use them.</p>\n<p>“Its purpose is to park a car, now how many of the garages that are affiliated with apartments and or houses do they park cars in? Not many,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said future permit plans should reference previous I.V. parking regulation attempts, such as the Isla Vista Master Plan parking management program of 2004 which was denied by the Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>“Coastal Commission’s main priority is to protect access of the public to the coast … that access points can be parked in at reasonable fees so that the beaches of California remain accessible to everybody,” Freeman said. “They end up in a strange position when communities like us come to them with parking programs.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB should discourage first-year students from bringing their cars to Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If the University provided that as a really strong statement in their introductory material to send to their parents, then the parents would have a strong influence on their children, saying ‘well the University really doesn’t want you to have a car there,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said freshman students have a “right” to car ownership.</p>\n<p>“I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car,” Murdock said. “How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB will not voluntarily alleviate the I.V. parking problem without incentive.</p>\n<p>“We need to be thinking about how to exert leverage outside the University in order to get them to do things we might want them to do,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Hammond said a mobile home site for students living in trailers could be an alternative parking solution.</p>\n<p>“A better solution might be to try and build some sort of trailer park somewhere for people who live in trailers or in their cars to park safely,” Hammond said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said instead of I.V. parking officers determining whether cars are parked for more than 72 hours by chalking tires, officers could implement a pay-by-plate program.</p>\n<p>“You have an SUV drive through I.V. and as it drives through I.V., it is scanning all the license plates that are along the side of the road and determining what cars are in what positions,” Freeman said. “And then if you want to buy a permit you don’t have to decide on a parking spot, you aren’t tied to a spot, you can just pay by tying your license plate into either a kiosk or a website or over the phone. That means that we can have visitor parking to be essentially any spot we want in I.V.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/","id":4606,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4605,4604,4603],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
