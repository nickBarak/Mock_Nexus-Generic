","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As future leaders, we all have a responsibility to do what we can to advocate for solutions to climate change. With approximately $3 billion invested, the University of California system is in a powerful position to influence the fossil fuel industry as an important shareholder. When one divests on moral or ideological grounds, one guarantees that the assets will be controlled and managed by a new party that cares less about the ideas and morals that led to the divestment. In the United States, the boards of directors of public corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to seek profits for the common shareholders. If the owners (shareholders) of the fossil fuel industry do not care about climate change, the companies are legally obligated to similarly not care. Rather than divest, the UC system should exercise its role as a prominent shareholder to pressure fossil fuel companies to adopt more forward-looking policies to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations. In the past, there was a national effort to divest from the tobacco industry due to the known public health consequences of tobacco consumption. Aside from negative publicity, divestment efforts were largely inconsequential. In fact, depressing an industry’s stock prices due to large-scale divestment tends to boost the return on equity available to the remaining shareholders through more effective share buybacks and dividend reinvestment; Philip Morris (now Altria) was one of the highest returning stocks of the past 50 years. The real success of the anti-tobacco movement in the United States, aside from public smoking bans, arose from targeted health advocacy to disseminate information on the negative health effects of smoking.</p>\n<p>The energy industry contains some of the world’s most highly qualified scientists, skilled workers and engineers who work on the most challenging problems of our generation. The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy. For the first time, we are beginning to see renewable energy emerge as a viable large-scale commercial option. Our generation is accustomed to rapid progress and is understandably frustrated by the snail’s pace of the energy sector. However, the energy grid is comprised of hundreds of billions of dollars of existing infrastructure and has been developed for over a hundred years; it is not amenable to rapid change.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moreover, as an educated student body, we must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve and view the energy sector with long-term objectives. For instance, the Obama administration opposed the expansion of many activities such as the use of Canadian oil sands, coal power generation and oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean because these activities have a relatively high environmental impact. On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age. In fact, the United States’ carbon emissions declined by 12 percent from 2005 to 2015, due to the increased use of natural gas over coal for power generation. </p>\n<p>A recent article in the Daily Nexus claimed that Chancellor Henry T. Yang has endorsed Fossil Free UCSB in its calls for divestment. His statement has been misconstrued; he did offer his support to the activists, but he did not explicitly endorse a divestment from fossil fuel industries.<br>\n“I stand by our students who have been sitting in calling for fossil fuel divestment this past week and support their aims … In the coming week, I look forward to working with my fellow chancellors in support of a thorough and transparent discussion on divestment from fossil fuels as part of the UC’s approach to combating the climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>It is encouraging to see an administrator engaged with the student body, although his response leaves much to be desired. As a highly qualified engineer and scientist, Chancellor Yang could use this opportunity as a teaching moment to provide more direction to the activists. Under President Donald J. Trump, research institutions and regulatory agencies are under assault, and now more than ever we need common-sense actions on climate change. Above all, I commend the organizers of Fossil Free UCSB for their impressive achievement and successful display of civil disobedience, but I suggest a more constructive approach. Lobby for new policy to clarify the UC system’s relationship with fossil fuel industries, and engage the regents to commit strongly to climate advocacy in their capacity as shareholders. This includes advocating for increased funding of renewable energy initiatives and fundamental research at our universities and national laboratories, improved regulatory oversight for fracking wastewater disposal and other pollutants and a “revenue-neutral” tax on carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>Even if it otherwise makes sense to divest, the chancellors must consider the impact divestment is likely to have on our community. The UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers to effectively manage its resources in pursuit of its strategic mission. Divestment on moral grounds reduces the universe of potential investments, and this can only decrease the returns available to the overall portfolio. Can the chancellors demonstrate that the opportunity cost of divesting from fossil fuels does not significantly impact the growth of our system’s endowment or the quality of our institution?<br>\nNathan Prisco is a second-year graduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB.

When one looks at how much money was spent this year per prisoner in CA ($52,363) versus the money spent per student ($7,440) it’s easy to see that what we have in this state isn’t a question of not having enough money. It’s a question of priorities.</p>\n<p>One might say that if we have people locked up it’d be heartless to not spend money on them. But the reality is that in the 2008-09 year when $47,000 was spent per prisoner, only $1,612 went toward rehabilitation while $19,663 went toward “security,” i.e. prison guards’ salaries.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard the argument put forth by Democrats and “progressive” politicians that jail overcrowding dehumanizes the inmates, so the only humane thing to do is to build a new jail to lock them up in. I’d like to dispel that rumor once and for all. There is dehumanization in jails, but as someone who was arrested for nonviolently protesting and spent the better part of 16 hours in the custody of Santa Barbara’s finest, I can say from experience that while overpopulation may play some small part, in the end it’s the police and the prison system that dehumanizes people.</p>\n<p>Why keep backing a broken system? We cannot simply build more jails and prisons and pretend that the root social issues that cause crime will disappear. The U.S. Department of Justice states, “The typical offender is undereducated, unemployed and living in poverty before incarceration.” According to a 2003 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 75 percent of state prison inmates didn’t complete high school. The state and local money that would go to building this prison and creating a $5 million slush fund for the police could be better spent on improving education and battling poverty. Both steps would do much more to reduce inmate numbers than building a new jail.</p>\n<p>David Uruza, the self-appointed spokesperson for the “left” says that “the building of a new jail would not increase the number of people that are arrested and kept behind bars.” Sorry buddy, but this is California, we don’t build jails or prisons we don’t intend to fill to the brim.</p>\n<p>As Belen Robles, a local community activist, wrote, “Since 1980, California has built 23 prisons and one university. This construction has been matched by harsher sentences, increased policing and a shift in financial priorities from health and human services to policing and prisons. These changes have caused the prison population to go from 20,000 to 170,000, proving that the number of cages determines the number of people locked in them.” This measure is a step backward not a step forward.</p>\n<p>The last problem I have with this measure is police fear mongering. The “Yes on S” signs promise a “safer Santa Barbara county” but is that a reality? Proponents play on the upper class fears of the Santa Barbara populous by creating this rhetoric about being forced to release violent criminals early because there’s no room to put them in the county jail. I’ve even talked to a Santa Maria businessman who told me how Mr. Bill Brown threatened an opponent by saying something to the extent of, “we’ll have to release dangerous criminals and if they hurt anyone it’s on your hands.” The truth is that the people prioritized for early release are nonviolent offenders: normally people caught sleeping in parks, drunk in public or in possession of controlled substances. A local politician who supports Measure S bluntly and truthfully told me those tactics are used simply because “that’s what gets voters outside of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>So I urge you all, “left” or “right,” to vote no on Measure S. At the end of the day, it is simply a jail tax with some extra pork for police and firefighters along with a tokenizing bit of money for “rehabilitation.” As the old saying goes, you can dress up a pig with lipstick, but it’s still a pig.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/measure-enforces-dehumanizing-status-quo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/measure-enforces-dehumanizing-status-quo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/measure-enforces-dehumanizing-status-quo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/measure-enforces-dehumanizing-status-quo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/measure-enforces-dehumanizing-status-quo/","id":6257,"author":{"id":575,"name":"Jaret Ornelas"},"related":[6256,6255,6254],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vote Yes on Measure O!","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Ethan Bertrand discusses Measure O, its impacts on Isla Vista residents, and why he believes you should vote Yes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello! I’m Ethan Bertrand, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District and former director of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District* (IVRPD). I’m writing today to urge Isla Vista residents to vote YES on Measure O this spring to invest in the continued excellence of our treasured parks, open spaces and recreational programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For over 40 years, the IVRPD has been a partner in making Isla Vista the special place it is.  Born out of the environmental movement in the 1970s, our park district has preserved natural resources through the establishment of a unique network of neighborhood parks, the efforts of the Adopt-a-Block cleanup program and the use of organic maintenance methods. Committed to building relationships between community members, the park district co-sponsors Isla Vista’s best community events, leads an engaging Children’s Recreation Program and oversees an accessible community garden program. All of us are so lucky to benefit from the work of the IVRPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large amount of service the park district provides is made possible by the grants, collaboration with other organizations and long-term investment of generations of Isla Vista residents. The park district receives most of its funding from bedroom taxes approved by voters in 1997. In consideration of the financial positions of I.V. residents, the IVRPD has worked diligently to provide services without raising taxes. In fact, the park district hasn’t asked voters for additional funding in almost 20 years. Today, friends of the IVRPD realize the need for a greater investment from the community to meet the the desires of residents and pay for long-overdue park and facility maintenance.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By voting YES on Measure O and approving a $28.75 annual bedroom tax for 10 years, you will make sure our park district can continue to keep our community green, enhance the quality of life in Isla Vista and support the vibrant nature of the paradise we get to call home. Generating approximately $2,500,000 for the park district over the next 10 years, funding from Measure O may be used to bring recycled water to the parks, pay for outdoor exercise equipment, establish a dog park, expand recreational programs for all Isla Vista residents and fund many other innovative projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust me, I understand that “tax” can be a scary word. Luckily, I have good news for you. Until the 2015-2016 school year, property owners (and their renters) were paying the same amount of money per bedroom to pay off a bond. This means that for most of us residents, there will be no increase in the amount of park district taxes and fees we have gotten used to paying. This election will be conducted through the use of mail-in ballots. Ballots will be mailed to the addresses of registered voters in Isla Vista beginning April 10. After marking YES on Measure O, be sure to place your ballot in the mail immediately. The last day for mail-in ballots to be postmarked is May 9. To avoid forgetting to vote or misplacing your ballot, I highly recommend voting at your earliest convenience.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks make life better, so I hope you will join my friends and I in voting YES on Measure O. Please talk to your friends about supporting our parks, and stay tuned for campaign updates.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Titles used for identification purpose only.</span></p>\n<p><em>Ethan Bertrand wants you to join him and his friends on voting YES on Measure O.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/vote-yes-on-measure-o/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/vote-yes-on-measure-o/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/vote-yes-on-measure-o/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/vote-yes-on-measure-o/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/vote-yes-on-measure-o/","id":6258,"author":{"id":650,"name":"Ethan Bertrand"},"related":[6257,6256,6255],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why UCSB Should Not Divest From Israel","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/letter-to-the-editor-correct-dimensions.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/letter-to-the-editor-correct-dimensions.jpg?resize=650%2C500&ssl=1","description":"A letter to the editor from Gefen Laredo in response to The Bottom Line's \"Why UCSB Should Support Divestment.\" ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A recent article in <em>The Bottom Line</em> (May 2, 2017) titled “<a href=\"https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2017/05/why-ucsb-should-support-divestment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why UCSB Should Support Divestment</a>” began by falsely stating: “Recently universities across the nation have begun to divest from Israel.”</p>\n<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. No university in America has divested from Israel. In reality, academic and economic cooperation between U.S. universities and Israel is closer than ever.</p>\n<p>For this reason and many more, UCSB’s student government should not support divestment. We must first reject the false assertion that other universities have divested. They haven’t. The vast majority of divestment resolutions brought up at universities have failed. Even those resolutions that have passed, usually after wearing the Jewish community down after repeated assaults, last for only that senate’s year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sentiment in a senate changes from year to year and does not bind future student governments. For example, had BDS been brought up at UCLA again this year or next, it would have likely been defeated. Just because it passed once years ago doesn’t mean that UCLA supports BDS. The UC Regents have already stated that boycotting Israel is discriminatory and they will not divest — period.</p>\n<p>Next, the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement is anti-Semitic. The Anti-Defamation League — the authoritative voice on anti-Semitic activity and one that the article cited — stated that BDS is designed to undermine Israel’s existence. Saying that the Jewish state does not have a right to exist is anti-Semitic, and the Jewish community, both here at UCSB and worldwide, has overwhelmingly agreed with that assertion. It should be up to the Jewish community, and the Jewish community only, to define what anti-Semitism is on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>We can judge the BDS movement’s intentions through quotes by the founder of the movement, Omar Barghouti. He believes that Israel “will be renamed Palestine,” ending the existence of the nation-state of the Jewish people. Advocating for the eradication of the Jewish state is anti-Semitic, against the two-state solution and supported by the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>On the more nuanced scale of criticizing the isolation of Israel, which the article dismisses as “shifting focus,” this is an old anti-Semitic trope. BDS isolates the Jewish state, a unitary emblem of the Jewish people, and uses that isolation to economically strangle it. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious anti-Semitic conspiracy document, did the same thing. It isolated the Jews and made them the face of global corruption.</p>\n<p>The BDS movement does the same, pretending Israel is the global face of oppression, co-opting causes and arguing that taking down the Israeli regime is tantamount to fighting for global justice. It grants no other country such vitriolic treatment.</p>\n<p>Just this week, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had incredibly harsh words for Israel in an interview with AJ+, signed a letter along with all 100 U.S. Senators, to the United Nations, demanding a cessation of isolating and condemning only Israel. He also went on to declare that he does not support the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>You’ll often hear pro-BDS activists say that it is OK to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic. This is absolutely true. Israelis are incredibly critical of Israel, and recent polls show that a stark majority are in favor of a two-state solution. However, the BDS movement goes far beyond that.</p>\n<p>It is a campaign of de-legitimization, demonization and an abhorrent double standard employed against the only Jewish state. This makes it anti-Semitic. If I, as a Jewish student, have to stand at a wall and defend not just the country that my grandparents sought refuge in when they were exiled from Morocco for being Jewish but also my core identity as a Jew, then this movement is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>If I have to look at the words “anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism” and feel attacked, silenced and marginalized, then this movement is anti-Semitic. Zionism is the right to self-determination for the Jewish people. That is all it is. If this movement is against the right to self-determination for only the Jewish people, then it is the opposite of progressive.</p>\n<p>I can speak for a large majority of the Jewish community on campus and say that we stand for a two-state solution. We stand for fair and equitable treatment for the Palestinians. We stand for peace. BDS does not stand for peace.
