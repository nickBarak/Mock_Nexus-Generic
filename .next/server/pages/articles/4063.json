The alleged data thieves have since been arrested, according to the notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement did not specify whether it was Santa Barbara city or county police that notified the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates said it was notified by police on March 23 about the potentially affected applicants, including a list of their email addresses. According to Wolfe &amp; Associates, these individuals have been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Erin Valenzuela, a third-year communications and philosophy double major, only one person in her four-person Wolfe &amp; Associates-managed apartment had been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found out more from twitter than I did from them,” she wrote in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fourth-year student who leased with Wolfe &amp; Associates from 2016-18, and asked not to be named because they intend to pursue legal action, said in a message that “The main concern is the cosigners. If my data was breached, my parents are my cosigners so the likelihood of their socials being taken as well are very high.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals who applied for apartments managed by Wolfe &amp; Associates after February 2018 have not been impacted by the breach, and payment information was not compromised in the breach, according to Scott Wolfe, vice president of Wolfe &amp; Associates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe also said that people who have been “potentially impacted” by the breach have been notified and that Wolfe &amp; Associates has been “working to respond to a number of inquiries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email sent out to impacted Wolfe &amp; Associates residents, the agency recommended that tenants “notify the police department of any unusual activity” and to “check with credit bureaus, financial institutions, and insurance companies that you do business with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates also recommended in the email that tenants change their passwords for bank accounts, credit cards and “any other entity that you have financial dealings with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the company encouraged those affected to sign up for credit monitoring services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have arranged to offer monitoring service with NortonLifeLock at no cost to you for a period of one year,” the company wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leasing agency also said to report any unusual activity to the SBPD case agent, Detective Rapp, as well as individuals’ financial institutions, such as credit card companies. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They will continue to strike until their demands are met, according to a statement posted to the movement’s Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements on other campuses are planning a one-day, full work stoppage “blackout” strike on Thursday, March 5, in solidarity with the dismissed UCSC graduate students. At each campus, COLA movements are urging faculty to cancel all classes and undergraduate students to walk out of any classes that professors didn’t cancel. Organizers are also asking participants to wear all black. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an ever growing number of students who are ready to strike and who are prepared to strike,” Zak Fisher, UC Los Angeles’ Graduate Student Association president, told the Nexus. Fisher attributed this sentiment not only to the COLA movement at UCLA but also to the firing of the UCSC graduate students, noting that participation in COLA organizing has “increased exponentially.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA graduate students voted Monday evening to join the Thursday “blackout” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up … the [UCSC] firings brought a lot of attention from people who weren’t really paying attention before,” he said, adding that hundreds of people have attended  UCLA COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher, as GSA president, said he presented the UCLA COLA demands to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block on Feb. 21. But beyond that, he said he hasn’t seen much of a response from the chancellor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is it that it’s the ‘number one public university,’ in the country, [and] the leader of the university won’t come out and publicly address concerns?” Fisher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to at Davis, UC San Diego organizers are leaning more toward a grading strike rather than a full strike, according to Syed Muhammad Abbas Yousuf, an ethnic studies doctoral student, and Avaneesh Narla, a physics doctoral student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that a recent UCSD COLA movement vote showed that around 200 graduate students were willing to strike in some capacity, although there is a “strong leaning toward holding a grading strike rather than a full strike.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Week Nine, UCSD graduate students scheduled a number of events aimed at educating undergraduates about the movement and gaining support across campus for the movement; they will be joining the “blackout” strike by holding a walkout around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley graduate students also voted to join the one-day “blackout” strike, according to Tara Phillips, a UCB COLA organizer. UCB’s strike will last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Sproul Plaza in the center of campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCB COLA movement also voted Tuesday to create a departmental organizing structure and will begin asking different departments to hold meetings to discuss and vote on strike-readiness, according to a resolution passed by the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we’ve reached 10 strike-ready departments, we will call a General Assembly to vote on strike escalation on our campus,” an email sent to supporters of the UCB COLA movement said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Riverside, graduate students plan to join the UC-wide “blackout” strike with a rally at 11:45 a.m., according to the movement’s Twitter account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has also released a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyviszddmLXQBJLzQkF7FesG53qcQWrZ0BetfINuBtmzk78A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the UCR community, asking students to stand in solidarity with the UCSC strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While graduates at some campuses are taking steps toward a vote to strike, others, such as UC Irvine, haven’t decided to go on a full strike but are still organizing for a COLA in other ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI COLA organizers Nalya Rodriguez, a sociology doctoral student, and Courtney Echols, a criminology law and society doctoral student, said that UCI COLA organizing began on Feb. 20, when over 200 UCI graduate students and supporters rallied in solidarity with the UCSC strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UCI put the administration building Aldrich Hall on lockdown. During the rally, campus police </span><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/02/29/uci-alumna-arrested-by-ucipd-during-cost-of-living-adjustment-rally-for-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested UCI alumni </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikera Chamndany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after she entered the building while attempting to obtain her transcripts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chamndany, who was reportedly not involved with the COLA movement or participating in the rally, was “handcuffed and tackled,” the New University reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arrest drew backlash both on campus and across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We firmly believe that this [is] indicative of the anti-Blackness that pervades not just UC Irvine, but the UC system as a whole,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echols said.

We’re especially cognizant that the time to act is now, the time to be proactive is now, because we have a chance to stop this in our own city and prevent further rent burden and further rent hikes before it gets as dramatically bad as it has gotten in the other campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diep said that UAW 2865 leadership, along with general members, met with UCM Chancellor Nathan Brostrom on March 2 to </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWBMnJQHG5tgoC2JGAN3kUUHBlaZHxcm-QVkCCLlKXg/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discuss graduate student struggles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that they plan to meet sometime next week for a follow-up meeting. Diep emphasized that the discussion focused on broader needs and did not focus on the specific TA contract currently in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no formal UC-wide response to the COLA movements to date; organizers across the UC system emphasized that negotiations need to happen through UCOP instead of at individual universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents filed an Unfair Practices Charge against UAW 2865 on Feb. 24, alleging that the union has failed to take action to end strikes at UCSC. In response, UAW 2865 filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges against the UC; the UAW 2865 bargaining unit also voted on March 3 to hold a union-wide vote whether to go on strike due to unfair labor practices. All union members will vote on this in April. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

A couple of salient memories of the time for me include having to tell the women of Tri Delta that they had lost two of their members due to a senseless act of violence. A happier memory is creating the I Heart UCSB Pledge with student leaders that is now read with all new UCSB students during orientation as they receive the I Heart UCSB pin. I will be remembering the students we lost this Saturday while I visit the benches created in their memory, located in the Love and Remembrance Garden that I helped envision and organize.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yasamin Salari — 2020-21 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista has been the first place I’ve felt at home since I moved to the U.S. The vibrant sense of community, the friends who have supported me through all my ups and downs in the past three years and the mere beauty of our campus are just a few reasons I’ve felt so welcomed here. Our beautiful town has also endured great hardships. I was only a freshman in high school when the May 23, 2014 tragedy occurred in I.V., but my brother was a student at UCSB at that time and I remember so distinctly the sense of grief that took over my family that night. Although it was the immense sense of grief that brought together our community at first, we have continued to commemorate this day by remembering and honoring the lives lost on May 23.</span></p>\n<p><b>Christian Ornelas — 2019-20 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last four years, Isla Vista has been my home. It has sheltered me and given me the tools I needed to grow. In my role as the External Vice President for Local Affairs, I had the privilege of developing relationships with the many people that dedicate their lives to making this community a safe and inclusive home for all of us. This special little place by the sea has taught me the value of friends, neighbors and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was not in Isla Vista on May 23, 2014, I continue to feel the collective grief shared by our community. The aftermath of that day brought together a beloved community that continues to memorialize the lives lost. We remember George Chen, Katherine Breann Cooper, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, Weihan “David” Wang and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss. If you find yourself in I.V. on Saturday, I invite you to pick some flowers and leave them at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden adjacent to Embarcadero Hall in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To all the caretakers of Isla Vista — thank you. Let us never forget about the events that took place in 2014, and let us always remember to move forward with love and compassion in honor of those we lost.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jeike Meijer — 2018-19 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the painful circumstance of being physically separated this year, it is really difficult to come together and mourn in community. We are learning non-physical ways to show our remembrance. This year, I’ll be using virtual ways to send remembrance to the lives lost and the friends and families of the victims. I also will be giving energy and healing to the first responders and community members whose lives were so pivotally impacted on this day of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will also be stopping by the Remembrance Garden on May 23 to mourn because that has become a place of gathering to honor the six lives lost. George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michael-Martinez, Veronika Weiss: You will never be forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spencer Brandt — President of the Board of Directors of Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My generation of students was the first to be fully removed from the May 23 tragedy. Unlike many of my friends that I would come to know and love, we were not in harm’s way when shots were fired. I was sitting at my parents house, watching the gruesome news unfold on Twitter. As I scrolled down the timeline, it became clear that the killer had left a manifesto of misogynistic ramblings that provided a clear motive for the violence. Soon, in a reaction to many users arguing that “not all men” held such misogynistic views, #YesAllWomen began trending, drawing attention to the harassment and discrimination that women experience every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six years later, we can’t be physically together to memorialize the tragedy. But for me, the distance allows time to reflect on May 23 in ways that I haven’t in the past. This year, I’ve been thinking about how, as a straight white male, the tragedy reminds me of the responsibility I have to live out masculinity in a healthy way. Because toxic masculinity was an important factor in the misogynistic “incel” ideology that the May 23 killer professed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no secret that toxic masculinity abounds in a college town like ours. As an elected official, I spend a lot of time focusing on worst manifestations of it: sexual assault, street harassment and interpersonal violence. And in 2014, mass murder. And while most in I.V. agree that these things are pervasive problems that we ought to solve, there is less discussion about how to promote and cultivate a positive vision of masculinity: one that means loving and respecting others, being honest with yourself about your emotions and desires and taking assertive action to stop unhealthy and harmful behaviors in other men. We owe it to George, James, David, Katherine, Veronika and Chris to have these difficult conversations, and constantly be doing what we can to make IV’s culture more inclusive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Margaret Klawunn — Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I arrived at UCSB in the fall of 2015.  I have been honored to participate in important commemorations of the loss this community suffered in 2014 each year that I have been here.  This year, I am on my way to the Love and Remembrance Garden to leave flowers there in honor of George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss. I recognize that others were wounded and many more deeply affected by the violence of May 23, 2014. This year, I am feeling deeply the impact of the coronavirus and the social inequities it has laid bare, and this grief and loss resounds with the misogyny and violence of 2014.  It is also evident to me that there has also been some incredible love and light that emerged as this community came together, and I continue to see that strength and power in Isla Vista among students, staff, faculty and residents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Batsheva Labowe-Stoll — 2017-18 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista changed our community forever. The immense grief of students and community members sent shock waves that are still felt today. Yet through all the sadness and fear, Isla Vista came together to create incredible monuments in our community. Through hard work and advocacy, we now have a local government that listens and responds to the needs of its constituents. Today, I.V. is a safer, stronger, more resilient place than it was six years ago. We are more aware, more attentive and have no tolerance for hatred and violence. Our community will forever mourn the unnecessary and tragic deaths that occurred that day, but we will continue to be strong and move forward together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud </b><b>— </b><b>General Manager, Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember the days leading up, the day of and the days after so clearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it always feels like yesterday. I knew someone who was murdered, some who were injured and countless people who were moments away from having been in the wrong place. I wasn’t in I.V. that night and had just completed my term as student body president, but rushed back as soon as possible the next day. I still hold some guilt over not being in town when it happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night changed me and many others, along with Isla Vista itself, forever. It was actually gut-wrenching at the time to see how Isla Vista was getting the attention it needed only after and because of six people being murdered. Ending the cycle of only supporting Isla Vista after major tragedies was a big reason why we created the Isla Vista Community Services District. I decided to stay in I.V. after graduating in the following weeks to work on this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, we can never forget those who were taken from us that night (George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss) and not give any attention to the person behind the tragedy. But it’s also important to remember how May 23 is connected to misogyny, white supremacy, toxic masculinity, gun violence, the incel ideology and in a way our broken mental health system.
