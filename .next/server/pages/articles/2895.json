Luckily for Oakland, Jason Campbell is not as fond of cough syrup as the team’s former quarterback JaMarcus Russell. It has to be hard to hit a receiver coming across the middle on a crossing route when you’re a little hungover on sizzurp.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But with the Raiders, it all starts with the front office. It seems the only explanation for Oakland’s success is that Al Davis — who eerily resembles a cross between an orc from “Lord of the Rings” and some sort of sea monster from “Pirates of the Caribbean” — is, in fact, dead. The franchise is finally able to function normally without him.</p>\n<p>On a serious note, Davis has made some great personnel decisions as of late, including the acquisition of Campbell and deciding to keep Head Coach Tom Cable while relieving him from play-calling duties. First-year offensive coordinator Hue Jackson has taken over this role, and the normally stagnant and even laughable offense has seen a major boost. Just halfway through the season, the Raiders’ offense is well on pace to pass their offensive production from all of last year in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>It seems a stable quarterback and a little bit of continuity in the coaching staff can go a long way. Take notes, 49ers.</p>\n<p>The star of the silver and black has been third-year running back Darren McFadden. If you haven’t seen him play, the dude is amazing and is finally living up to the hype that surrounded him when he left Arkansas. It seems the talent is back, and after two frustrating, injury-plagued seasons (believe me, I would know after owning McFadden in fantasy leagues the past two years) he has finally put it all together.</p>\n<p>In addition to boasting some of the best stats in the NFL so far this season, McFadden also boasts one of the bests nicknames in the league: RUN DMC (Get it? He runs. His first name starts with a D. And his last name has the MC… there goes the light bulb for some of you slower ones).</p>\n<p>Halfway through the season, the Raiders are currently second in the NFL in rushing, while DMC leads the league in yards per game with 108.1 and in yards after contact with 358  (more than his entire rushing yards total from last season), is fourth in rushing yards at 757 and third in yards per carry at 5.4.</p>\n<p>The Raiders have also fought to overcome adversity. The team started off 1-3 before turning their season around and going 4-1. After beating the Chiefs on Sunday, Oakland sits only a half game out of first place in the AFC West.</p>\n<p>The team has shifted its philosophy as of late, actually making strategic moves instead of the usual Oakland head-scratchers. Refraining from getting greedy in recent offseason free agency markets, building a good team through the draft and strategic acquisition such as Campbell and veteran defensive end Richard Seymour have paid dividends for the Raiders.</p>\n<p>Seymour has been an unbelievable pickup. Earlier this season, it looked like the Patriots’ front office had done it again, when the Raiders seemed destined for a top five pick — a pick that they traded to New England for Seymour. However, that pick is not looking to be as valuable as previously thought. Meanwhile, Seymour has provided leadership and excellent play on the field. The defensive line has been the strength of the Raiders’ defense, which is seventh in overall defense and third in passing defense. Seymour — who has 4.5 sacks and 4 tackles for loss on the year — constantly demands double-teams, which frees up other players.</p>\n<p>The bye week actually may be coming at the wrong time for the Raiders, who are riding their first three-game winning streak since their 2002 Super Bowl season. I say the Raiders are for real. Although we shouldn’t get too ahead of ourselves due to their recent success, the silver and black seem destined to challenge the Chiefs and the Chargers (who will make their usual late-season run) for an AFC West division title.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush sells purple drank by the barrel, and at a very reasonable cost.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

For most other surfers, the ride is more challenging, more tiring, not as fast and not constantly filmed in HD by surf paparazzi. Rodeo flips and pro tournaments may be more than a little out of reach for myself and 99 percent of the rest of the surf world.</p>\n<p>People always say to me, “I wish I had started surfing earlier. It’s too late to start now,” or “I started too late, I won’t be able to become a good surfer.” Ugh. What pessimism. Don’t you unenlightened landlubbers get anything?</p>\n<p>Surfing is not about the babes, being able to boost air or getting a tanned bod. Surfing is not about the contests, the World Championship Tour or corporate sponsorship. It’s not even about Betzaida’s mouthwatering heiny.</p>\n<p>There’s real magic to the sport of kings. When you submerge yourself in surfing’s depth, waves become your spiritual fuel. The rhythmic bob of the tide is your pulse. Paddling is your breath, the spray of saltwater your speech.</p>\n<p>I’ve met people fifty years my senior who can surf with more skill, patience and style than myself. I’ve read accounts and seen videos of surfers in their 80s and 90s still going strong. They’re the inspired ones, the people I aspire to be. It’s not because they’ve become more used to balancing on their surfboard, more accurate at predicting waves or even more crafty at maneuvering the lineup, but because they’ve been able to keep the soul-buzzing feeling of the session in their lives even past their physical prime.</p>\n<p>There’s a certain delighted twinkle that manifests in the eyes of lifelong surfers. It’s almost an “I know something you don’t know” kind of jesting taunt. But when that soul surfer happens to talk about his or her experiences and smile — a smile that connects the whole mouth and eyes into a portrait of bubbly excitement — you begin to understand what a lifetime of soul adventure can do for one’s spirit.</p>\n<p>If you do it right, surfing will fulfill you, provide you purpose, bliss, satisfaction, exercise, community and challenge. The first step is entering the water with an open mind. The next step is to return to the water frequently. The final step is to stay positive and grateful to have at least a moment to float by yourself, with your buds or perhaps just the dolphins and fish.</p>\n<p>So don’t “what if” your surfing prospects.

Her mother, Debbie Green, who played volleyball at USC, is a former Olympic silver medalist and the Long Beach State assistant coach of 23 years. At Long Beach, she coached her oldest daughter, Dana’s older sister Nicole, who was a setter as well. Additionally, Dana’s father Joseph Vargas is a former two-time Olympian for the USA water polo team.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a family like that, I was obviously influenced a lot,” Vargas said. “They really helped me take advantage of the opportunities I had in front of me, and I am very grateful.”</p>\n<p>“Dana has had a lot of pressure on her because of her family and their success in athletics,” Gregory said. “She was always expected to perform, and she has. She handles the pressure like a pro and is always focused.”</p>\n<p>Nicole, who plays volleyball professionally in France, is the root of much of the competitive spirit that Dana possesses. The two would battle endlessly, competing in everything from sports to  board games growing up.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of one time I beat my older sister in anything,” Vargas said. “Not in volleyball, any sports, or even Monopoly. Ever since I was little I have had a really competitive spirit and wanted to win everything, but for some reason, she would always beat me.”</p>\n<p>It is safe to say that Vargas feels right at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I love Santa Barbara,” Vargas said. “My teammates and coaches are awesome, the atmosphere is amazing, and the weather isn’t too bad either.”</p>\n<p>For a player whose career will be forever marked in Gaucho volleyball history, Vargas was dangerously close to committing to University of Miami over UCSB as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>“At first I didn’t even want to come on a visit but my mom forced me to,” Vargas confessed. “Kathy and I connected on a player-coach level and two days later I called [Kathy] to commit here. To this day I know that I made the best decision for me.”</p>\n<p>Vargas stormed onto campus, making an immediate impact in one of the most impressive freshman seasons in school history. The freshman setter played in all 52 matches and dished out 1,381 assists — good for ninth all time in a single season at UCSB. Vargas ranked fifth in the Big West with her 11.51 assists per set as her play earned her Big West All-Freshman team honors.</p>\n<p>“I recruited [Dana] to be the starter right away,” Gregory said. “I was not really surprised when she came in and played well right away. She is extremely talented and focused and I knew what she was capable of.”</p>\n<p>In her first ever match for the Gauchos, Vargas lived up to, if not exceeded, her coach’s expectations. She tallied 61 assists against San Diego State that game — one shy of her career-high set earlier this season against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I remember that first match really well,” Vargas said. “Unfortunately we lost in five, which was a bummer, but that really boosted my confidence and showed that I belonged. It set the tone for the rest of my season.”</p>\n<p>Although Vargas played well individually, her first few seasons at UCSB did not go so well, with the team finishing below .500 in each of her first two seasons at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Those first few seasons, we didn’t do very well as a team, and I took that kind of hard,” Vargas said. “I’m such a competitive person, so it got to me a little.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ list of career accolades is not a short one. Last season as a junior, Vargas was named an American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American Honorable Mention and received First Team All-West Region and First Team All-Big West honors. Her 1,297 assists last year were also tops in the Big West and her average of 10.90 assists per set ranked her #2 in the Big West and 40th in the nation.</p>\n<p>Apart from the impressive statistics she continues to compile on the court, Vargas’ leadership is the key. For anyone watching a Gauchos volleyball game, it is clear that Vargas is the team captain. Always vocal and encouraging, Vargas is constantly pumping up her team, being a verbal leader on the court.</p>\n<p>“It has been a great experience to play with Dana,” senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog said. “I have watched her grow and mature as a player and grow as a person these past four years. She is a natural born leader and has so much confidence on the court.”</p>\n<p>Another noticeable characteristic of Vargas is her passion. Self-described as feisty, Vargas more than makes up for her lack of size at 5’7” with her intensity.</p>\n<p>“I love her aggressive personality,” Gregory said. “Her leadership and passion make the whole team better. She always plays her hardest and is always in control, which is important for a setter and team leader.”</p>\n<p>After graduating in the spring with a degree in sociology and a minor in history, Vargas plans to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and go to Europe to play professionally.</p>\n<p>“Dana is an awesome person,” DeHoog said. “She will succeed in life because she is so reliable and such a great leader.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will close out its 2010 campaign on the road this weekend at UC Riverside. For Vargas, it will be her final match in a Gaucho uniform, the culmination of four years of hard work for Vargas.</p>\n<p>“My experience here has been amazing,” Vargas said. “Kathy is one of the few coaches who truly cares about each of her players and what happens to them after college. I am so fortunate, and UCSB and the athletic program have been so amazing to my team and me. They have made my experience something to remember.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/dana-vargas-born-dominate/","id":2893,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2892,2891,2890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: How to See the Future","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There is always one.

He threw for just 231 yards and zero touchdowns, and complemented that with three interceptions and two fumbles for a grand total of four fantasy points. Luckily for me, the team I was facing did so badly that I didn’t need Henne in order to win, but I know I won’t always be so lucky.</p>\n<p>Henne is not the first player to let me down, and he won’t be the last. Week 1 it was Calvin Johnson. Week 2 it was Hines Ward.  Week 7 it was Larry Fitzgerald. And next week? It could be anyone. All I know for certain is that someone will attempt to sabotage my fantasy day and there is nothing I can do to stop them.</p>\n<p>Read into matchups to root out problems and set the best possible lineup each week. It is only because I had players like Aaron Hernandez and Sebastian Janikowski in my lineup that I managed to scrape out a win, and it is only because I knew how poorly the Cleveland Browns were doing against tight ends that I knew to start Hernandez.</p>\n<p>The fact is, you can’t predict letdowns. Even if a player has what seems to be a favorable matchup, they can still have off days for an unforeseeable reason such as injury or because that player’s team is just having a collective off day.</p>\n<p>All you can really do is attempt to set the strongest lineup possible week in and week out based on matchups and predictions, neither of which really mean anything, which basically means there is no real way to know if you are completely screwed or not. Having good players helps, but even they have off days. And on that note, I say to you good luck and may the force be with you. Trust me, you’re going to need it.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg never, ever leaves one cookie on the plate.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/","id":2894,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2893,2892,2891],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
