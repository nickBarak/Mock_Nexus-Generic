My home life was never the best, and I struggled with anxiety in high school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa went to C.A.P.S. for the first time during her second year of college, after being referred by Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.). Her first experience with a therapist, however, wasn’t what she had wanted it to be — namely because Ochoa felt like her therapist, a white woman, didn’t understand her and her experiences as a Mexican woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I couldn’t relate to her at all,” Ochoa said. “I found that now that I [have] found a different therapist that I really needed somebody who understood my background.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa didn’t return to C.A.P.S. until the beginning of last summer, after a quarter of academic troubles and the looming threat of academic disqualification. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Ochoa, “going home [wasn’t] an option,” so she decided to spend the summer in Isla Vista and work while she figured out her next steps; during that time, she heard about a new therapist at C.A.P.S., Jessica Adams, who Ochoa said was Puerto Rican and spoke Spanish. She decided to give C.A.P.S. a second chance and booked an appointment with Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like she listened and I felt like she was actually helping me and I felt like I was getting the help that I needed,” Ochoa said. “And that was from the first time that I met her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa noted that Adams was able to “catch onto things that [she] hadn’t told her yet,” which reassured her that her new therapist was a good fit for her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ochoa said she spent her sessions learning to cope with her anxiety and to notice when her depression was getting worse. It’s a victory for Ochoa that she now goes to sessions every few weeks, versus her weekly appointments when she first started out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Adams] has given me a lot of tools to kind of focus and cope with things on my own to get myself out of certain ruts,” Ochoa said, adding that she sees herself continuing counseling after she graduates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reason Ochoa had the opportunity to access therapy was because she was on a college campus, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Talking about mental health] was honestly something new to me,” Ochoa said. “My mom didn’t really talk about that, she was just like, ‘Oh, no you aren’t depressed, you’re just lazy,’ ‘What do you even have to be depressed about,’ or I don’t even think she knows what anxiety is, still.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She comes from Mexico, and it’s a hard thing to talk about… And it’s so easy for her to dismiss mental health.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other students who spoke about their experience seeking mental health help noted that it was the combination of stigma within their families in addition to the financial burden that prevented them from seeking help before they went to college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tatum Katz, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Ecology, Evolution &amp; Marine Biology, first went to therapy as an undergraduate at Occidental College in Los Angeles. At home, her parents didn’t believe in mental illness and she didn’t have insurance, so “it was just not a possibility” for her to get help.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Katz, seeking therapy at Occidental was “more of a reaction to a crisis, and a lack of understanding of myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s continued counseling while at UCSB and now describes mental health as “something that I need to do and need to stay on top of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a physical every year, you get your blood work, you get your shots or whatever, you should do that with your mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But C.A.P.S. doesn’t have to be just for students with long-term mental health problems — for some, C.A.P.S. has helped those who run into crises during their college years, such as Marisol Gonzalez, a fourth-year linguistics major who first went to C.A.P.S. after her close family member had a stroke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was her first time seeking mental health resources and while she doesn’t see herself continuing therapy after college, she said she was glad to be able to take advantage of the resource during the distressing time period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t able to focus on school or just anything. I tried going to class, but I just ended up crying all over campus, and I was just a mess,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interviewees recommended that incoming students try C.A.P.S., many acknowledged how difficult it can be to get appointments and how that may impact students who are asking for help for the first time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. Director Brian Olowude said that the office had recently hired a handful of psychologists and were “constantly looking at [their] available hours” in order to meet student demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that while staff had increased by 50% over the last five years, “initial contacts” with students had increased 127%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is currently working on developing its first-ever annual report, set to be released in the next month or so, which will include information about how many people the office had seen in the past year and what services were provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude said that about 16% of the campus uses C.A.P.S.’s services, compared to the six to 13% of college students who use mental health services on college campuses nationally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say confidently that access to mental health services at UCSB will probably outpace [students’] access in the community when they leave here,” Olowude added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to offering short-term counseling services in their offices, C.A.P.S. also provides community referrals for long-term counseling options in the community — one of which is Acacia Counseling, a clinic in Isla Vista that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/acacia-counseling-wellness-supports-ucsb-students-mental-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solely to provide accessible long-term counseling options for UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main areas that Acacia Counseling specializes in is helping students through the development of their identities through formative college years, which is why it’s important for them to staff their offices with clinicians who reflect the population they serve, Kristen Strong, director of the center, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude also emphasized that, as UCSB is a “minority-serving institution,” it’s important for C.A.P.S. psychologists to be reflective of their diverse clientele. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude and Strong both emphasized that students should take their time finding the right therapists for themselves, and that the first therapist they see may not always be the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You might not fit culturally, you might not fit personality-wise, and that’s not anything necessarily bad,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa echoed Strong and Olowude’s sentiments about putting in the effort to find the right therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially for people of color, I would really suggest to try to find somebody who you can relate to, who looks like you,” she said. “A lot of my mental health issues came from my childhood and growing up… so people not understanding the cultural aspect of a person, I feel impedes you getting the best help that you can get.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Bring it on. Read me the NFL record book, aka Peyton Manning’s biography. Make it about jewelry, how the 31-year-old QB has just one ring and miles to go if he’s going to catch Tom Brady or Joe Montana.<br>\nSay he isn’t even the best to put on a Packer uniform. I’m standing by my claim.<br>\nIf you saw Mr. Discount Double Check’s performance against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football, then you saw in a nutshell why I think he’s the most complete signal caller of all-time. His stat line of five touchdowns, 24-35 passing, 33 yards and a quarterback rating of 138.5 says a lot, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.<br>\nRodgers is deadly accurate whether he’s standing in the pocket or on the move. He’s so quick and mobile, with feet that never stop hopping, it’s almost impossible to bring him down. Even when there is pressure in his face, he has a lightning quick trigger and a Spidey-sense presence that allows him to throw ridiculous fade-away bullets right into his receiver’s chest.<br>\nIt’s like watching Madden, except in real life. Wait… isn’t that the point of Madden?<br>\nIt can be argued that in this day and age, performances like this happen all the time around the league. Even a rookie like Marcus Mariota can throw for four TDs and no picks in a game. After all, we are currently living in the era of iPhones and inflated passing numbers.<br>\nWith Rodgers though, it’s almost assured that we’re going to see sky-high numerical dominance every single time he steps on the field. That’s why his QB rating of 106.8 is the highest in the history of the NFL and the only one above 100 (Tony Romo and Peyton Manning are distant runner-ups at 97.6 and 97.3, respectively).<br>\nI’m not saying he’s the greatest quarterback ever. That’s obviously a boringly impossible-to-prove statement to make.<br>\nBut in terms of the accuracy, the mobility, the numbers, the consistency and the overall feeling of helplessness that he gives to opposing defenses, I don’t think there’s another quarterback in any situation that I would ever take over him.<br>\nSure, Brady is the ultimate winner. Sure, Peyton is the ultimate robot. And, yes, our parents once watched Dan Marino and Joe Montana and will never change their minds about who the best ever is.<br>\nIn the end, whether he’s on my fantasy team or the team I root for, I’m picking Brett Favre’s patient former backup to lead me to victory, and I don’t think there’s anyone in the NFC that can stop him.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cardinals Are For Real</strong><br>\nAfter Week Three of last year, I put the Arizona Cardinals’ chances of winning the Super Bowl at zero. The reason? Quarterback Carson Palmer had torn his ACL for the second time in his career.<br>\nEven without Palmer in the lineup, the Cardinals proved just how good they were by starting off 9-1 and making the playoffs with third-string quarterback Ryan Lindley heading the offense.<br>\nFast forward to now. Arizona is 3-0 with the most points in the league and the third-fewest points allowed.<br>\nWhat stood out to me most while watching what could be the beginning of the end for Colin Kaepernick in the Cards’ 47-7 demolition of the 49ers on Sunday was just how ruthless Arizona Head Coach Bruce Arians is. Despite going into the half leading 31-7, Arians’ message to his team was simply this: “Step on their throats.”<br>\nThis isn’t to be confused with the message that Sean Payton has for his New Orleans Saints to literally step on their opponents’ throats. This is more in the scoreboard sense. #bountyjokes<br>\nAll humor aside, I don’t know about you, but if I were a six-foot, 230-pound athlete with a super strong frame, lightning speed and physically violent capabilities, then Arians is the kind of guy that I would want to play for. Unfortunately for me, I’m about 60 pounds shy of being that.<br>\nNow I’m not 100 percent sure what goes on behind the scenes with the New England Patriots other than cheating, but I’m guessing Bill Belichick is sending the same kind of message to his players as they put 40 and 50 burgers up on teams, regardless if it’s in the rain or snow. That’s just one of the many reasons why he’s won four Super Bowls.<br>\nRight now, the Cardinals have it all: an excellent coaching staff, a tenacious defense with playmakers all around, an offense that seems to be drinking water from the fountain of youth, not to mention their supply of young studs like Michael Floyd, John Brown and Andre Ellington.<br>\nIf the Cardinals can stay healthy, they are the favorites to make it to the NFC Championship alongside Green Bay. They have the right mindset to do it.<br>\nIf there’s anything that the 2009 runner-up Cardinals, led by old dog Kurt Warner, or the 2007 and 2012 New York Giants have taught us, it’s that it just takes one solid run in January to make it to the greatest show on turf, America style.<br>\nCarson Palmer, just watch your knees and get Larry Fitzgerald that ring already.
