This marks the first time since 2012 that a conference opponent has swept UCSB. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its most critical conference series of the season, the UCSB baseball team came out flat against the top team in the conference, UC Irvine, losing all three games in the series after yesterday’s 8-0 defeat.</p>\n<p>UCSB drops to sixth place in the Big West at 7-11 in the conference and 26-14-1 overall on the season. Meanwhile, Irvine remains atop the standings as it extends its conference winning streak to 12 games and improves to 14-1 in league and 32-14 overall.</p>\n<p>UCSB trailed early yesterday after a big five-run inning by the Anteaters, a deficit the Gauchos did not come close to challenging for the entire game. Freshman pitcher Shane Bieber was erratic in his start, managing to get only one out before Head Coach Andrew Checketts went to the bullpen. Bieber was victim to five hits and two errors; it only took 23 pitches for Bieber to exit the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Irvine scored two more runs the following inning to put the game out of reach for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>This marks the first time UCSB has been swept by a conference opponent since 2012.</p>\n<p>In danger of losing another conference series, the Gauchos clung to a late lead before giving up three runs in the final innings to lose 3-2 on Saturday. Santa Barbara previously had a 19-0 record when leading after six innings, but sophomore closer Dillon Tate allowed the game-winning single to the first batter he faced in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Irvine scoreless entering the seventh inning up by two runs until UCI began its comeback. Junior third baseman Robby Nesovic committed a throwing error to first base, allowing the runner on third to advance and tie the game after UCI earned its first run on a RBI groundout.</p>\n<p>The two runs were charged to junior pitcher Austin Pettibone, who exited the game after allowing hits to the first two batters of the inning. Pettibone worked efficiently other than his final inning pitched. The right-hander commanded the strike zone to keep the Anteaters off the board, but ran out of gas towards the end. He finished with 6.1 innings pitched, four strikeouts and two walks allowed.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Woody Woodward came to bat in the second inning with a runner in scoring position to earn the game’s first run on a RBI single to center field. Not until the fifth inning did we see any scoring from either side. Senior left fielder Joey Epperson knocked in a run on only his third hit of his last 26 plate appearances against a conference opponent to give the Gauchos a 2-0 lead at the time.</p>\n<p>Irvine jumped out to a two-run lead in the second inning of the series’ first game on three hits off of starting sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome. UCSB, however, was quick to counter with two runs of its own in the following inning to tie the contest at two runs apiece.</p>\n<p>Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa knocked in both runs with a bases-loaded, two-out single to right center field. In putting up two runs on the scoreboard, Santa Barbara became just the fourth team this season to score multiple runs against UCI’s senior pitcher Andrew Morales.</p>\n<p>Jacome ran into trouble again in the fifth inning, first by allowing a single and a walk, then by giving up a two-run RBI double to junior first baseman Connor Spencer for a 4-2 Anteater lead. Still in the sixth inning, Jacome retired two batters before giving up a triple to score the runner from first base.</p>\n<p>UCI tacked on one more run in the seventh inning as Morales kept UCSB in check throughout the game. Morales improved to 8-0 on the season, pitching 7.2 innings, striking out seven and walking only three.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays tomorrow against Cal State Bakersfield on the road in a one-game solo series. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 4th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/ucsb-drops-three-straight-in-sweep/","id":4416,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4415,4414,4413],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Supporters climbed a ladder on the side of the Co-op building to see the newly installed panels on the roof. Afterward, groups celebrated by cutting a giant ribbon with a pair of scissors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco-based nonprofit RE-volv started the Solar Ambassador Program as a way to help organizations and businesses switch to renewable energy. The one-year program takes college students and trains them in finance, management, crowdfunding and community engagement in a four-day retreat in Tomales Bay near San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv, said the ceremony was a way of raising awareness about renewable energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A project like this and a ribbon-cutting like this is [sic] really meant to show all the customers that come here, all the community members, all the students in Isla Vista at Santa Barbara, that solar power works,” Karelas said. “It saves the Co-op money, it can save you money and it’s something that we could all get behind and get involved with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Solar Ambassador team started their project in 2015. After signing the lease with the Co-op in the fall, the team raised $59,261 in donations during a crowdfunding campaign in the spring of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Godfrey, a fourth-year environmental studies major and one of the solar ambassadors, said she’s happy that the project is finished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited to see everything come to a close,” Godfrey said. “My favorite thing about the project was seeing the love and support that the community has for the Co-op. You don’t really see that until you tell them about something and then their face lights up, and it’s really awesome to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Solar Ambassador team commissioned Sun Pacific Solar Electric, a local solar contracting company, to build 100 solar panels capable of generating 24 kilowatts of energy each.

It’s the same mentality going into this weekend as any weekend.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine comes into the weekend’s contest as the hottest team in the conference with an 11-1 league and 29-14 overall record on the year after defeating USC in a one-game series on Tuesday. Prior to that game, UCI swept three of its four conference series with its lone loss coming against UC Riverside. However, the Anteaters’ conference record at this point might not reflect the team’s true identity.</p>\n<p>Irvine has preyed on the lesser teams of the conference and has yet to face a ranked Big West opponent. This series against the Gauchos marks the beginning of a tough stretch of ranked conference opponents for UCI, which has to play Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton to close out the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been hurt by inconsistent starting pitching that has resulted in the team playing from behind on many occasions. UCSB will need its pitchers to go deeper into games and command the strike zone against an Anteater team that features many threats on offense. Among those hitters is junior first baseman Connor Spencer, who leads the team with a .366 batting average and 33 RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send out its same three starting pitchers it did in its previous conference series. Sophomore Justin Jacome will take the mound in game one after displaying a solid outing in his last start. In that performance against UC Riverside, Jacome pitched into the seventh inning and allowed only two runs to pick up his fifth win of the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone will try to bounce back from a subpar start last week. The Gauchos’ ace was not his usual self in his last game as he allowed five runners to reach home plate, which raised his ERA to 4.94. Freshman Shane Bieber will take the mound in the third game of the series.</p>\n<p>Besides pitching playing a key role in gaining the upper hand, the Gauchos will also need to perform better offensively to come out with a series win.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have be better at executing,” Checketts said. “It’s a difficult park to score in and they have good pitching, so we’re going to have to be able to [play] short game and be able to bunt and be able to execute hit-and-runs and do the little things we didn’t do against [UCLA].”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Anteaters enter in first place primarily due to their pitching. Irvine has a combined 2.50 ERA and senior Andrew Morales leads the staff with the nation’s third-best ERA at 0.78.</p>\n<p>If UCSB establishes a lead in the final innings of any of its games, the team has an excellent track record of closing the door on its opponents because of its bullpen. Junior relief pitcher Greg Mahle has excelled in his role as setup man for the Gauchos this year. In 24 appearances, Mahle has a 1.90 ERA to go along with 30 strikeouts. Against the Bruins, Mahle retired the six batters he faced without trouble.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most consistent pitcher all year long however, has been sophomore closer Dillon Tate. Tate has served as the lights-out stopper coming out of the pen for UCSB this year. To put into perspective how dominant the hurler has been so far, he has struck out 39 batters in only 29.1 innings of work. Tate had his longest outing of the season against UCLA, throwing four innings of shutout ball before the game was called a draw.</p>\n<p>Despite pitching four innings on Tuesday, Tate will be available to pitch as early as the first game of the series if the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p>“He went through 56 pitches [against UCLA]. He should be able to bounce back and be okay,” Checketts said. “It probably won’t be a long save. We usually don’t use him long on Friday, but if he has a save opportunity I think he’ll be available.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Irvine is scheduled for tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/","id":4414,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4413,4412,4411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stricter Dog Leash Regulation May Come to Some I.V.
