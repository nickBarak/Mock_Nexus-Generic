Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The first meeting began calmly, but quickly escalated when Josephine Ampaw, the former student advocate general, asked for the Senate’s support of a resolution providing financial assistance to the student who was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forcibly detained</a> by police in the Arbor earlier this year.</p>\n<p>“Police were supposed to use reasonable force. This behavior is seen as excessive force,” Ampaw said. “We can’t just put the student at fault; everybody needs to take responsibility for their actions.”</p>\n<p>As the Senate questioned her, she maintained that the while the student made a mistake, the police filed a false accusation that led to the student’s unjust incarceration.</p>\n<p>The Senate passed a similar resolution several weeks ago condemning the way UCPD handled the situation but was unable to agree on allocating money toward the student. This resolution, however, divided the Senate.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to taking a position on something we can take a position on whatever we want,” said then-Senator Batsheva Stoll. “When it comes to student fees and students’ money, we have to be more careful with what we fund and what we won’t.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78182\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78182\" data-attachment-id=\"78182\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/a-s-ucsb-senators-sworn-in-for-2017-18-term/senate-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"senate 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78182\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78182\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former A.S. senator Charles Neumann sports a toga for his last Senate meeting.

Read what’s on the table and form your own opinions and let other people in public forum shape that.”</p>\n<p>Party divisions arose soon after, however, when newly sworn-in senators from the Isla Vista Party contested Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu’s selection of Senators Brooke Kopel and Anthony Pimentel as her first and second pro tempore. Both ran with Sandhu under Campus United.</p>\n<p>Senators who ran with the Isla Vista Party effectively blocked Pimentel’s confirmation.</p>\n<p>They said Sandhu had not followed the proper procedure in choosing her pro tempores as outlined in A.S. Legal Code, which says that the internal vice president must choose the pro tempores after going through an interview process.</p>\n<p>They also said that they wanted the second pro tempore to be someone who ran with the Isla Vista Party to ensure that both parties are represented.</p>\n<p>The Senate agreed to table Pimentel’s confirmation until next week. Sandhu said that she will not be taking any more applications, but will conduct interviews with those who submitted applications over the course of the next week.</p>\n<p>She also expressed her disappointment in the polarized start of their first Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>“You aren’t even allowed to mention parties in Senate,” Sandhu said. “I was so disappointed. The second that I come in here we have a divide. No Senate began this divided.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Carbajal is a co-sponsor for the Keep Families Together Act. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The facility is located approximately 45 minutes away from El Paso, Texas, and houses 319 children ages 13 to 17, according to Carbajal. The children originate predominantly from Guatemala and then Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico respectively.</p>\n<p>The detention center is operated by a private contractor, <a href=\"https://discoverbcfs.net\">BCFS</a>, which is a “global system of health and human service nonprofit organizations with locations and programs across the U.S. and abroad,” according to the corporation’s website.</p>\n<p>While Carbajal said he believes the contractor is providing a “basic level of care,” he argued that it is not the right approach to this “self-imposed, developed crisis.”</p>\n<p>“They’re woken up at 5 a.m. after they were incarcerated and regimented, they’re rushed to showers and given less than five minutes at most,” Carbajal said in an interview with the Nexus. “Because this facility is in the desert, they’re only given 10-20 minutes of recreation once or twice a day.”</p>\n<p>“So clearly, these are not optimal, adequate conditions for children,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also noted there didn’t seem to be a clear system for children to file complaints regarding assault or other grievances.</p>\n<p>Among the 319 children being housed at this facility, 26 have been separated from their families, Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Although Carbajal is an original co-sponsor for the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3036/text\">Keep Families Together Act</a> within the House of Representatives, which puts limitations on the separation of families and sets deadlines for reunification, he said he is not hopeful about the likelihood of it passing due to the Republican control of the House, Senate and White House.</p>\n<p>While U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered on Tuesday that the process of family separations be ended and that children be reunited with their families within 30 days, Carbajal said he has not seen any concrete plans to do so.</p>\n<p>“This administration is now saying that they are going to reunite children but haven’t provided a shred of evidence or detail as to how they’re gonna go about doing that,” he said. “There’s a conflict of data between the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department of the custody of children. How many of them are there? Where are they? How are they going to reunite them? It’s all a big question mark.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also visited the United States port of entry in El Paso and questioned Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers about the current procedures in place for migrants who come to the border seeking asylum.</p>\n<p>Carbajal was disappointed by the lack of information he was provided, stating that he questioned the officers “without sufficient answers.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The answers you’re seeking, I was seeking, and clearly they’re not providing them,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Carbajal said he was told by the CBP and the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (I.C.E.) officials that children were being kept at a facility at the border — not Tornillo — for longer than the three-day limit due to the lack of coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).</p>\n<p>“They’re violating the human rights of these children based on U.S. law. And the I.C.E. officials admitted that to me,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>The presence of I.C.E. has been criticized at UC Santa Barbara — specifically, the compliance of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) under Sheriff Bill Brown with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">publicly positioned himself</a> against Senate Bill 54, which designates that local and state law agencies not work with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Amidst calls to abolish I.C.E., Carbajal said he stands for stricter “oversight and inquiry” of the agency’s enforcement actions and says I.C.E. “indiscriminately” targets undocumented individuals rather than individuals who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the abolishment of I.C.E…. this is a larger conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal instead argues that the current immigration system needs to be comprehensively reformed on a national level, calling the current system “broken.” Only after this reformation will all the issues that fall under the umbrella of illegal immigration be addressed and resolved, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m an immigrant myself. I immigrated to this country when the immigration system worked better.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal commends the individuals who are speaking out about their “discontent and their opposition” ahead of the Families Belong Together march planned for Saturday at 11 a.m. in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We need to stay vigilant, and make sure that we press this administration. The reason they’re modifying this policy a little bit is because there’s been public outrage throughout the country, and people should continue to express themselves,” Carbajal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
