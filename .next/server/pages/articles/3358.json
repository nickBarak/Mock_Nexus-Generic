All that and the draft doesn’t even really improve parity of a league that has seen many of the same teams make the playoffs year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Under the rules of the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, rookies are the best deals in the league. That’s because their contracts are constrained by the rookie wage scale, which keeps their first-year salaries artificially low so teams could get a great investment.</p>\n<p>Per the terms of the CBA, each team has a rookie pool it can spend on its draft picks, with the size of the pool descending as the picks get lower. Spotrac estimates that the Browns will only be able to offer the first overall pick a contract worth a total of $30 million over four years.</p>\n<p>That’s a whole lot less compared to former first overall pick Sam Bradford’s $76 million contract given to him by the then St. Louis Rams after drafting him in 2010, which is, understandably, upsetting to this year’s pick (Myles Garrett, if the Browns are smart) since he would earn probably double without the rookie wage scale.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rookie wage scale only exists because teams went overboard with their rookie deals prior to its implementation, such as in the case of Bradford, who only spent four years in St. Louis throwing for only 11,065 yards, 59 touchdowns and 38 interceptions for a very average 80.1 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>This wage scale makes it so that rookies are the most cost-effective commodities in the NFL. Oakland Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, for instance, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season, is still on his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $18 million, per Spotrac. Von Miller, the player Mack beat out for DPOY last season, currently has a six-year $114.5 million contract. In 2017, Mack provided the Raiders with Von Miller-level production for just 15 percent of the price.</p>\n<p>No wonder teams like the Browns choose to tank. Only through the draft can teams find elite talent that costs as much as a middling veteran.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the draft system, NFL teams have a strong incentive to tank in order to secure a high pick. In my mind, any system that encourages losing is a broken system that requires major reformation.</p>\n<p>That reformation doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, it’s as easy as simply making incoming players free agents and creating a set rookie-free agency period.</p>\n<p>This change would wipe out any incentive to lose and would allow all teams to compete to sign the best rookie talents. There would be no rookie wage scale to artificially depress the wages of players like Khalil Mack and players would at last have the ability to choose where they want to start their careers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the new rookie system would work like college recruiting. Teams, starting with the opening of the rookie-signing period, would work to court the top rookies of each class with fat contracts and promises of playing time, and each player would be able to choose from a variety of suitors.</p>\n<p>The existing salary cap would still be in place to act as a restriction on any one team’s ambitions during the rookie free-agency period.<br>\nSure, the Cowboys might be able to attract more rookie interest than other teams, but they’d only be able to sign as many top rookies as they could fit under the salary cap.</p>\n<p>Bad teams like the Browns would still have somewhat of an advantage in the new order, given their large amounts of cap space. All that space would come in handy when competing for the top rookies. Myles Garrett might love Texas, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to turn down additional tens of millions of dollars the Browns or 49ers can offer him.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the new rookie system would prioritize and reward smart teams.</p>\n<p>There are undervalued gems like Julian Edelman and Antonio Brown in every draft, players who in the new system would be available for cheap. While the Cowboys might go around pulling in one or two big names with big deals, other teams could snap up lots of these low-cost, high-value players. It’s what the Patriots and Steelers have been doing for years.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a draft to a rookie free-agency period would be a massive, but necessary, shift. It’s high time that the NFL and the NFLPA give rookies some actual power upon entering the league.</p>\n<p>Abolishing the draft would do that while simultaneously eliminating losing incentives in the NFL. That’s a win-win, and it won’t come at the cost of the NFL’s treasured parity.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/abolishing-the-nfl-draft-resisting-the-shields-flawed-system-for-incoming-players/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/abolishing-the-nfl-draft-resisting-the-shields-flawed-system-for-incoming-players/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/abolishing-the-nfl-draft-resisting-the-shields-flawed-system-for-incoming-players/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/abolishing-the-nfl-draft-resisting-the-shields-flawed-system-for-incoming-players/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/abolishing-the-nfl-draft-resisting-the-shields-flawed-system-for-incoming-players/","id":3358,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[3357,3356,3355],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault","biography":"Not available","articles":[11,39,40,146,167,173,205,236,306,308,309,317,765,767,825,947,951,973,1000,1187,1188,1189,1190,1192,1194,1224,1226,1364,1897,1906,3349,3358,3418,3419,3421,3422,4835,4838,4839,4851,4859,4863,4865,4867,4871,4886,4935,4953,4955,4956,4957,4958,4959,4960,4961,4962,4966,4967,4972,4973,4974,4975,4976,4977,4979,4980,4983,4985,4986,4990,4992,5004,5005,5006,5008,5009,5560,5565,5569,5572,5573,5577,5578],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"C.A.B.

The most recent trip took place over this past winter break and brought students to Texas, according to Alec Valdez, who serves as the alternative breaks co-coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy major, said alternative breaks fit the model of Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) as a whole: serving the local community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point [C.A.B.] came up with the idea of doing a program that went … out of the state of California. It’s a great program because it allows you to go outside of your comfort zone, outside of your culture zone,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B.’s free week-long volunteer trips are held during winter and spring break, and the group also holds a weekend trip during spring quarter. According to Valdez, Community Collaborations International (CCI), a private organization dedicated to setting up alternative break programs, helps C.A.B. set up the trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCI offers different locations and programs, Valdez said, and his job as co-coordinator is to look through the programs and pick which one works best, alongside making efficient use of the funds available — a task that takes all quarter to plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past winter break, the trip’s participants traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to help with the immigrant community there, Valdez said. He explained that this trip wasn’t “the first time we’re doing social justice work as opposed to just disaster relief,” noting that participants traveled to Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The destinations for each trip vary widely, ranging from Florida to Oregon, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/past-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B. website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students applying to be a part of a volunteer trip, however, are kept in the dark regarding the trip’s location — it isn’t until after they have been accepted that participants are told where the trip will be, Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big thing is that curiosity because when we put out the applications, they don’t know where they’re going yet. We leave that until the very end when we pick our final team,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/cab-alternative-break-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative breaks website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each program often gets an average of 200 applicants, but only 10 to 12 students are selected to go on the trip. Valdez emphasized the importance of selecting people who are willing and determined to volunteer, given how the trips are made possible by student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Valdez said that they are currently working on a smaller version of the alternative breaks: alternative weekends that would take students out of Santa Barbara into the wider California community to places such as San Francisco or Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just a vacation trip we’re going on. We’re doing service,” Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure that people who are going on this really value the opportunity and are putting in that effort to see that they really do want to be a part of the team and be a part of the project. We do value effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Valdez, C.A.B.’s work can vary depending on wherever it is needed most. Both Valdez and Cassandra Zhou, a fourth-year psychology and brain sciences major, attended the 2019 spring break trip to Wilmington, North Carolina and helped families rebuild their homes after Hurricane Florence had passed through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working at an animal shelter one day which had been overrun by abandoned and lost animals. They usually serve somewhere around 70 animals or 60 animals in that area. But then after the storm, they had like 150 animals on the property,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhou, the service trip allowed her to expand on her own local volunteering and provide support to people outside of her area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to do a lot of these things where you interact with different communities and you learn how to communicate with them and how to talk to them,” Zhou said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like volunteering gives you more of a purpose. I also typically don’t travel and alternative breaks with an amazing opportunity to travel for free, meet new people and contribute to a community that really needed help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar said that the UC Regents are required to give students and UCSA notice at least 30 days ahead of time if they are considering a tuition increase — in this instance, Sarveshwar said her organization was “not explicitly told that [the Regents] would be considering a tuition increase of five years.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re entitled to this period of notice; we don’t feel like we received it,” she said, noting that, to the Regents’ credit, they “took those concerns seriously and said, ‘You know, you’re right.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re happy to see these concerns taken into account … It’s a small victory,” Sarveshwar added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA “oppose any efforts to increase the tuition burden on individual students,” and circulated </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fe29yE-QD6Tq_l8_EvlHELKp23fB7_lAsMrFQlDEsXc/edit?fbclid=IwAR0gNd3FtIkXZ7ycGnGD1dsZGkS52DDoTsbPUDsOf80sHH9b5-Nm2eHTxrA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ahead of the three-day Regents meeting, lasting from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition brings up several concerns about the tuition models, noting that a cohort-based tuition model would drastically affect non-residents who receive no financial aid and that the model relies on guaranteed funding from the state of California, which could be “extremely difficult to maintain when state revenues begin to fall.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In an economic downturn, the UC may be forced to increase tuition unfairly on incoming students, or abandon the model altogether,” the petition states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the petition, UCSA also encouraged students to attend the Regents meeting  to voice their concerns. As of yesterday, the petition had garnered over 1,600 signatures, Sarveshwar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents’ tuition discussion will take place on Wednesday, Jan. 22 at 8:30 a.m. at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robertson Auditorium at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full discussion plan can be viewed </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/jan20/b2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the agenda for the three-day meeting can be viewed </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/meetings/agendas/jan20.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will be updated. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
