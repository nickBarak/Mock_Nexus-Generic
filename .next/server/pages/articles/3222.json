UCSB Advisory Committee, UCSB, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was authored by Letters and Science Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno and was student sponsored by Dylan Kupsh and Fatima Abdel-Gwad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early morning vote came down to 10 yeses, 14 noes and 0 abstentions; the decision to hold a secret ballot came at the end of a 10 and a half hour Senate meeting once the senators moved into a formal discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, senators vote with verbal or hand signals. A secret ballot allows each senator to anonymously write their vote down on a slip of paper. The slips of paper are then counted by the Internal Vice President (IVP) and A.S. staffers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I respect the vote,” Uribe said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after the meeting ended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of the Wednesday night, Thursday morning meeting was composed of public forum, during which approximately 90 audience members spoke to their opinions about divestment. Throughout the meeting, the audience was relatively split between pro- and anti- divestment stances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first time the Senate has utilized a secret ballot to vote on divestment since 2015. Both senators and their constituents expressed concern about students being doxxed before they chose to vote with the secret ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to divest was originally </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed back in 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when it failed 12-11-1.

Attorney General Ali Suebert disagreed on whether the resolution was directional or positional, throwing the Senate into a debate that ended with</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 12 senators walking out and never returning.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution later termed out at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">68th Senate’s last meeting.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, current A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi spoke midway through public forum about how, after combing through this year’s resolution specifically, her office concluded that it was directional, meaning that it only needed 50% + 1 votes. If it was considered a positional resolution, it would have required a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also clarified the rules regarding abstention votes, and said that senators who abstained would have their votes counted in the majority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution’s student sponsors emphasized that this year’s resolution was not affiliated with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, this was a point of contention with several senators at the table, who noted that the resolution referenced BDS resolutions that had passed at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators – including On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian and proxy Noah Fleishman – left the vote crying. Both had spoken at length during the discussion about their personal experiences with anti-Semitism and how they feel unsafe on campus, noting several anti-Semitic incidents that have occurred in recent weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian and Fleishman both spoke several times through the meeting against the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I firmly believe this resolution provides a platform for hate,” Toubian said around 4 a.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fleishman echoed similar sentiments: “If we go to a secret ballot, understand the safety of the Jewish community is in your hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators and public forum speakers called the resolution inherently anti-Semitic and asked what tangible change it would provide for Palestinian students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas emphasized throughout the meeting that A.S. UCSB had money invested in the companies listed, and public forum speakers and the student sponsors said that they did not want their tuition money to “fund the oppression of Palestinian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call to divest from A.S. UCSB investments was also the reason why Safadi argued that this year’s resolution was directional, in comparison to previous years, which did not have this specific call to action.</span></p>\n<p>Further coverage can be viewed below:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote to pass the divestment resolution failed 10-14-0. <a href=\"https://t.co/SPIkjvOkVi\">pic.twitter.com/SPIkjvOkVi</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1116309213926395905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez and Katherine Swartz contributed reporting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>Updated [12:33 p.m.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

After years of preparation, teams get their chance to reshape their rosters and hopefully reel in some of the league’s top talent.<br>\nRecent off-seasons have not disappointed. In 2010, we were all witnesses to the infamous “Decision,” where after months of speculation, LeBron James told the world he would be taking his talents to the Miami Heat along with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.<br>\n2011 was hell on earth for NBA fans as a lockout extended the offseason an extra two months. Laker fans however will forever remember it as the year of the infamous David Stern veto, a decision that sent Chris Paul across the hall to the Clippers locker room instead of the Lakers.’<br>\n2012 was the year of the “Dwightmare,” when after months of flip-flopping, Dwight Howard miraculously ended up in a Laker uniform along with Steve Nash, beginning one of the most disappointing seasons in sports history.<br>\nThe 2013 offseason has already seen multiple blockbuster deals reshape the entire NBA landscape.<br>\nThe first blockbuster came from the Celtics, who shipped off Head Coach Doc Rivers to the Clippers to replace Vinny del Negro, while Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce were sent to the Brooklyn Nets to form one of the strongest starting lineups in basketball.<br>\nThe most anticipated move of the off-season came soon after, and for the second straight offseason it involved Dwight Howard.<br>\nAfter a dreadful season with the Lakers, the one they call Superman chose to leave and join James Harden and the Houston Rockets. The move will surely add to the league’s newest rivalry between the Rockets and Harden’s old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. The two young teams are set to dominate the western conference for years to come.<br>\nGolden State made moves to acquire Andre Iguodala from the Nuggets, adding a leadership presence to another young, rising western conference team.<br>\nThe Clippers didn’t stop after acquiring their new head coach, sending away Caron Butler and glorified backup point guard Eric Bledsoe to Phoenix for Jared Dudley and JJ Redick.<br>\nCleveland wasn’t able to fulfill Dan Gilbert’s promise of winning a championship before LeBron James did, but they might be headed in the right direction after signing former Laker center Andrew Bynum. Along with Kyrie Irving, Cleveland may have the best point guard-center combination in recent years.<br>\nThere were a few surprising moves by some of this year’s high profile free agents, starting with Josh Smith, Brandon Jennings and Chauncey Billups joining the Detroit Pistons. Monta Ellis signed with the Dallas Mavericks, Al Jefferson left Utah to join the Charlotte Bobcats, and OJ Mayo joined the Milwaukee Bucks coming off his best year yet.<br>\nNew Orleans, in their first year being known as the “Pelicans,” may also be a team on the rise after acquiring guards Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans  in separate deals.<br>\nOther than the Celtics, the NBA’s glory franchises have made only small adjustments to their teams.<br>\nThe Heat have stayed basically the same, with their biggest move being the re-signing of “The Birdman” Chris Andersen.<br>\nNew York moved some pieces around to acquire center Andrea Bargnani from the Raptors, while also re-signing J.R. Smith and guard Pablo Prigioni.<br>\nThe Lakers have moved on from the Dwight Howard saga and have made small one-year signings, including guard Nick Young and center Chris Kaman. With Steve Nash being the only contract on the books for the 2014-15 season, the Lakers are positioning themselves to bring in a star like Carmelo Anthony next summer to take the torch from the great Kobe Bryant.<br>\nWith that, nearly all of the offseason’s biggest moves are likely done. Fans will now go back to counting the days until they can see their team’s newly adjusted rosters in action.<br>\nJust two more months and normalcy shall return. Heat fans will continue to enjoy dominance, Thunder fans will be hungry to get back to the finals, Laker fans will be pretentious as always and Bulls fans… Well, Bulls fans will probably continue to wait for Derrick Rose to come back.

This tainted image of Rodriguez has come full circle and to many fans he is now the biggest liar in the history of the game.<br>\nBaseball is making a statement with this suspension and if it hasn’t completely removed itself from the steroid era, it has so with this decision. Twelve other players were suspended along with Rodriguez but none come close to what Rodriguez got. In fact, the player who was suspended the most games other than Rodriguez, Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, was suspended for only 65 games.<br>\nSo why was Rodriguez suspended for this length? Because not only is he guilty of more wrongdoing than any other player suspended, but what got him in even more hot water was his attempt to obstruct the investigation process such as trying to tamper with evidence. That’s what earned him a stiffer sentence than the rest and he must now deal with the consequences.<br>\nHowever, in typical A-Rod fashion, he choose to avert the situation. When asked point blank in a news conference if he used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined to answer the question, saying he would answer at another time. This stance, more than anything else declares his guilt.<br>\nWhat he attempted to do was make himself look like the victim in the situation, saying that the past seven months for him have been a “nightmare” and that he is “fighting for his life.”<br>\nThe public has grown tired of his denials and cat-and-mouse games. Rodriguez even accused MLB and the Yankees of trying to keep him from playing, a claim the Yankees have flat-out denied. The player who once was suppose to be the greatest player ever to play and become baseball’s “clean” home run king, may now never play again if the suspension holds.<br>\nIf the ruling is upheld, he will be 39 years old and going on 40 when his suspension ends and he has already suffered from more than one hip and knee surgery, not to mention that his offensive production has dipped in recent years. That scenario seems very likely to end his career, if not at least mark the beginning of the end for him.<br>\nRodriguez might be motivated to come back for the remaining money the Yankees will owe him. In 2007, he signed the richest contract in MLB history when he agreed to a 10-year, 275 million dollar deal. A-Rod can lose anywhere from 30.6 to 32.7 million dollars if suspended, yet he will still be owed about 100 million dollars and have four and a half years[[wouldn’t it be 2 years if he’s suspended until 2015?]] left on his deal when his punishment ends.<br>\nStill, Rodriguez is appealing the ruling and is allowed to play while waiting for a decision, which will not come until November or December at the earliest. The player’s union has already expressed that they will defend Rodriguez and has accused commissioner Bud Selig as “not acting [appropriately]”.  So, even when MLB tries to push him out, they still can’t push him out completely.<br>\nWith the door closed on the steroid issue, for now at least, fans can now appreciate the rest of the season. Division races are tight heading into the final month and a half of the season and players like Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers are having stellar seasons.<br>\nThere’s nothing positive about these suspensions but they go a long way in helping clean up the game. Fans must accept it for what it is and move on while Rodriguez accepts his place on the pantheon of cheaters alongside Barry Bonds, Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an

ongoing investigations into these labor practices by the UC. They’ve been trying to wash their hands of them, and soon it’s going to catch up to them,” said Erick Ceballos, a third-year political science major and student intern for AFSCME. “They can’t let it go without a fight.”</p>\n<p>University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE), a worker’s union for professional and technical UC employees, joined AFSCME in protesting against the UC. UPTE represents more than 13,000 employees, while AFSCME Local 3299 represents more than 24,000 employees across the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>According to Jarrod Coldron, a former UCSB student, present-day groundskeeper and Member Action Team (M.A.T.) leader for AFSCME, UC allegedly employed intimidation tactics against workers at the most recent solidarity strike with UPTE.</p>\n<p>“For example, we had some bosses that were threatening retaliation against workers who went on strikes. Unfortunately, we actually had some violence on the strike lines at Berkeley and Davis campuses, and as far as I know, that hasn’t been denounced by the UC yet,” Coldron said.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\">altercation</a> between a UC Davis managerial worker and strikers arose when a truck drove close to the picket lines during the three-day strike last fall. A UC Berkeley employee was also tackled to the ground and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/01/uc-berkeley-worker-detained-ucpd-uc-worker-rally/\">arrested</a> in a protest in February of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just out here to affirm that we have a right to speak and that even if we’re being intimidated, we’re going to make sure that our voices are heard.”</p>\n<p>More than 100 members came out to support AFSCME during the strike today, according to Serafin Zamora, UCSB groundskeeper and executive board member for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>Strikers rallied and marched from Storke Tower to Henley Gate, chanting phrases such as “Whose UC? Our UC!” and held signs that said “Standing Together for a Better UC” and “Where’s Yang?”</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, a fourth-year chemistry major at UCSB, explained that flyers with a FAQ were used to intimidate workers before the May strike. The flyers, sent out by UC, contained questions such as, “Can I be fired for striking?” answered by, “Yes, if it is not a legal strike.”</p>\n<p>“There’s more that they can do to support workers, and they’re not doing it. Instead, they’re being silent and it’s really saddening and frustrating as a student to see this,” said Ana Fabian, a fourth-year student intern for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“We come to an institution trying to learn more about these issues, but they’re happening right here right now.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
