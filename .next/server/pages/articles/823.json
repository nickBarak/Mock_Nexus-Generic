With freshman second baseman Katherine Pilpil and junior right fielder Allison Taylor on base, singles by sophomore shortstop Keilani Jennings and freshman designated hitter Kendall Gill put the Gauchos on the board.  Freshman first baseman Lauren Boser proceeded to ground out, but not before Jennings was able to make it home.</p>\n<p>Before yesterday, UCSB was 10-2 when scoring first.

In the fourth, Pilpil reached home on a wild pitch.  In the fifth, junior catcher Lainey Depompa was walked and then scored after a UCLA error and a single from freshman centerfielder McKenzie Kane.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return home this weekend to begin Big West Conference play against Cal State Fullerton before playing two nonconference games against South Dakota on Monday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-29/dominant-bruins-prove-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-29/dominant-bruins-prove-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-29/dominant-bruins-prove-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-29/dominant-bruins-prove-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-29/dominant-bruins-prove-gauchos/","id":823,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[822,821,820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Good Lo’dy wo’dy / I just took more shots than Kobe” Big Sean didn’t need to search too far to find a metaphor with the word ‘shot’ involved.

Kobe took 23 shots during the game, connected on 11 and finished with 28 points in the one-point defeat. The squad’s second game was a loss against the Kings, in which Kobe took 24 shots, connected on 10 and tallied 29 points.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played organized basketball you may have heard some variation of the phrase, ‘You can’t make it unless you take it.’ I think I’ve found Bryant’s next tattoo.</p>\n<p>The Lakers followed their two-game losing streak with three consecutive wins, in all of which the Mamba took less than 20 shots.</p>\n<p>The first 10 games of this season have shown that if Kobe keeps his shot attempts under 20, the Lakers will win. That doesn’t mean he needs to hold back on his shooting or even limit his shots per game for the rest of the year. However, it does mean that there are certain techniques and plays the Lakers use during these games that, if recognized, would benefit them in future matchups. Whether that means passing out of a baseline double-team instead of opting for the fall-away, or finding new options out of Mike Brown’s offense [Bynum went for 21 points and 22 rebounds against Houston!], there is a solution, and it doesn’t have to be Kobe slowing down.</p>\n<p>This year’s outcome of a shortened NBA season would without a doubt be different if the full schedule was put in place in November. The effects of 66 games as opposed to 82 this year are daunting to say the least, and will be made apparent throughout the year leading into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>1) Sixty-six games will be played over the course of just four months. That’s approximately one game every other day, three to four games per week. Combined with the exhaustion of travel and practice on off-days, this season will prove to be one of the most challenging for many players. Age will be a huge contributing factor toward the success of teams. The Oklahoma City Thunder are the youngest squad in the league, with an average age of just over 24 years old. They’ll be able to respond physically to the demands of the season, while veteran teams such as the Celtics or the defending champion Mavericks will have a harder time adapting to the rigors of this year. Think about this: Dallas and Boston rank No. 1 and 2 in oldest teams in the NBA, based on average player age.</p>\n<p>2) Come playoff time, seeds won’t matter. It’ll seem like March Madness, where any team can be upset at any time. Look at the 1999 season, which was cut to 50 games because of a lockout. The No. 8 seeded Knicks made it all the way to the championship. Because of this year’s shortened season, teams will not be able to gain as much experience of playing out-of-conference foes, and thus will be less prepared, setting the foundation for upsets across the league.</p>\n<p>3) Rookies drafted in last summer’s draft didn’t have the opportunity for fall workouts with their team or their new coaches, which severely limits them during this first part of the season. Teams that would normally be relying on their new rookie talent, such as Kyrie Irving at Cleveland, will be hurting as their rookies may need more time to adapt to the NBA. If a team is reliant on their rookie class, they may need to use this shortened season as a learning tool for next year.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Brent Pella wonders how many shots Big Sean has really taken this season.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/","id":820,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[819,818,817],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Johnson’s 36 Points Not Enough to Top UNLV","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In front of a loud and restless crowd, the UCSB men’s basketball team fell to visiting No. 18 UNLV 94-88 in double overtime in one of the best games at the Thunderdome in recent memory. “We left e...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In front of a loud and restless crowd, the UCSB men’s basketball team fell to visiting No. 18 UNLV 94-88 in double overtime in one of the best games at the Thunderdome in recent memory.</p>\n<p>“We left everything out there on the court,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said. “I couldn’t be prouder of my team.

UNLV threatened to run away with the game, taking a 57-49 lead after a 12-2 run with seven minutes left to play in the second half. Consecutive three-pointers from senior forward James Nunnally and Johnson brought the Gauchos to within two. The Runnin’ Rebels again held off the home team to take its biggest lead of the game at 69-59 with two minutes left to play after another Moser three, forcing a Gaucho timeout.</p>\n<p>“We knew the game was far from over,” Johnson said. “We practice those situations all the time. … We just kept believing in each other.”</p>\n<p>UCSB came out of the timeout determined not to go down without a fight, and Johnson took over. He started the comeback with an assist on a layup by senior center Jaime Serna. Johnson then ran off seven consecutive UCSB points to go along with a rebound and a steal to cut the deficit to one point at 68-69 with 17 seconds left. On the ensuing UNLV possession, Nunnally stole the ball and was called for a charge on the fastbreak in a controversial play.</p>\n<p>“I thought that first [charge call] was questionable,” Williams said. “It was a tough call, but as a competitor you always want to get those close calls.”</p>\n<p>UNLV took a three-point lead after two free throws, and UCSB had the ball under its own basket, down by three with seven seconds left. As expected, the Runnin’ Rebels opted to foul Johnson, sending him to the line down by three with two seconds left. After Johnson hit the first free throw, Williams subbed in seven-footer Greg Somogyi as the UCSB home crowd collectively held its breath.</p>\n<p>“It was amazing fan support,” freshman point guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was a great atmosphere to play in, and a really fun game…It is just disappointing that we came up short.”</p>\n<p>Johnson intentionally missed the second free throw, and in the scramble for the offensive rebound, Somogyi was able to miraculously corral the ball and toss up a shot, completing the Gaucho comeback to send the game to overtime with zeros on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to shoot it as high as I could, got a lucky bounce, and the big fella caught it and put it in with no time left on the clock,” Johnson said. “That was a big, exciting moment.”</p>\n<p>When the game is on the line, you expect your clutch players to play their best basketball. Johnson and Nunnally stepped up for the Gauchos in the first overtime period. Rejuvenated and excited after Somogyi’s buzzer-beater, the UCSB squad dug in defensively as the senior duo scored 10 points on 3-of-3 shooting and 3-of-3 from the free throw line to put the Gauchos up three with 13 seconds left. Taylor stepped up to hit a huge three-pointer with the game tied to put the gauchos in front at 81-78 with 1:19 left in the overtime period.</p>\n<p>“I have to be confident and step up in those situations,” Taylor said. “Orlando and [Nunnally] can’t do it by themselves.”</p>\n<p>On the next possession, UNLV recorded an offensive rebound off a potential game tying three-pointer before a second offensive rebound and quick kick-out allowed senior guard Chace Stanback an opportunity at the buzzer. Stanback hit the three as part of his 19 points, all of which came after halftime, to send the game to double overtime.</p>\n<p>“It was just desperation man,” the UCLA transfer Stanback said. “Thankfully I was able to hit it.”</p>\n<p>Williams explained his rationale behind not opting to foul UNLV to send them to the free throw line at the end of the first overtime.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, what we would have loved is to have a foul after that rebound with about four seconds left,” Williams said. “But I wasn’t thinking about fouling with [13 seconds] left.”</p>\n<p>In the second overtime period, Serna was called for an intentional foul that gave UNLV a free point with just under five minutes to play. They never trailed again, ending the game 94-88 behind two Stanback free throws. Another questionable offensive foul on Nunnally with just under four minutes left sent the senior to the bench for good with five fouls.</p>\n<p>“It hurt not having [Nunnally] out there,” Johnson said. “He is always a threat to score and they would trap me and I would have to pass.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally recorded 14 points and 8 rebounds, and senior center Serna added 13 points and six boards. Anthony Marshall recorded a game-high eight assists for the Runnin’ Rebels, and Stanback went 9-of-10 from the free throw line for his 19 points.</p>\n<p>The Runnin’ Rebels previously upset No. 1 North Carolina in Las Vegas 90-80. In that game, Stanback led UNLV with 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Moser with 18 rebounds, and Bellfield with 9 assists.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to give UNLV a ton of credit,” Williams said. “They were outstanding defensively. That’s the best defensive team we’ve played by far.”</p>\n<p>This marks the second consecutive game that the Gauchos have lost in overtime to a visiting Mountain West school. On Saturday night, UCSB fell to SDSU 76-75 in overtime. While the past two games are certainly tough to swallow for the veteran Gaucho squad, the team has some perspective going forward.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow, those games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on this, that’s all we can do…We can’t sit here and sulk, it was tough and it hurts, but tomorrow we are going to have to forget about it, and get back to studying for finals and getting ready for this roadtrip we got ahead of us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will hit the road for a four-game roadtrip against San Diego, Washington, BYU, and Cal that begins in San Diego on Dec 13.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/","id":821,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[820,819,818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Top CSF 77-64, Improve to 2-0 Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team captured its second straight Big West win in the Thunderdome last Thursday night, beating visiting Cal State Fullerton 77-64 in the team’s conference home opener.

Up by eight points with just over a minute left, it was Johnson’s turn to ward off a Titan run with six consecutive free throws (10-of-11 on the night). The Gauchos’ lead never dipped below eight as they secured the win 77-64.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” Peterson said of the team’s different looks. “We are a very versatile team and can be dangerous when we exploit our lineups against opposing teams.”</p>\n<p>Johnson paced the Gauchos with 23 points and six rebounds despite a poor shooting night (5-for-18 on field goals). Nunnally scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half, and Hornbuckle added nine points, five rebounds and two blocks. Garth recorded a game-high five assists.</p>\n<p>A scary moment for the Gauchos occurred with 12:10 left in the game when senior forward Jaimé Serna rose up to score on a driving layup and was fouled. Serna fell hard to the floor, landing on, and injuring, his right wrist. Luckily for Santa Barbara, X-rays taken the following day came back negative, and Serna is currently day-to-day.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased with the win,” coach Williams said. “[Fullerton] is a really good team. … Overall, it was a productive night for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/","id":822,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[821,820,819],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
