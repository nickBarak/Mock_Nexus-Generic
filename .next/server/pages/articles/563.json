However, before the Gauchos can do this, they’ll have one last opponent to get through today: Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters today’s game in a big slump at 6-14 overall and 1-6 in conference, leaving the team in eighth place. Meanwhile, Hawaii sits in a three-way tie for third place in the Big West with a 10-9 overall and 4-3 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>“We gotta win,” junior center Clair Watkins said. “We’re just trying to gel more as a team every day, work harder and get in better shape.

Even on the offensive side, that helped us because we were able to play a little more physical. I’ll be interested to see if we can play two small guards at the same time with [Onome and Nicole.]”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine essentially play four power forwards and a point guard, so while they don’t have incredible height like the Gauchos have seen in the past, they are a bigger team overall and play an extremely physical game.</p>\n<p>“They’re physical, so it’s not just going to be a test on the basketball side of it, but it’s a physical test and a mental test because they beat you up,” Mitchell said. “We will have to be ready to play blue-collar basketball.”</p>\n<p>The biggest target for Hawaii on offense will be senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who is a force down low despite the fact that she stands at just 5’11’’. She ranks sixth in the Big West in points at 15.8 per game, third in field goal percentage at 51.7 percent and third in rebounding, grabbing 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“She’s a beast. We’ve talked about getting in front of her because if she catches it, you’re done,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have to box her out, so we’re going to try to contain her on that end of scoring and boxing her out because she gets a lot of their rebounds. She’s averaging a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Jackson will address the Gauchos’ biggest weakness because all season long, Santa Barbara has struggled with consistency, especially on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In its last two games against UC Irvine and UC Davis, UCSB has played well in the first half and remained in contention at halftime, but then fallen apart in the second half, falling prey to defensive breakdowns. Against the Aggies, the Gauchos gave up a fatal 47 points in the second, compared to 35 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“Both games were close at one point and we let them get away from us,” Watkins said. “I think the biggest lesson we learned is that we have to put two halves together.”</p>\n<p>One of those defensive breakdowns has been failing to rebound in critical moments. Rebounding makes all the difference for Santa Barbara, which averages 40.7 boards per game in victories and 31 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be physical,” Watkins said. “We haven’t rebounded as well as coach would’ve liked this season so far, but we’re looking to turn our season around and it starts with rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Although the focus won’t be on offense tonight as UCSB hasn’t struggled nearly as much on that end of the floor, Hawaii is a great defensive team. The Rainbow Wahine top the conference in scoring defense, holding teams to 65.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for our kids’ mindsets is that they play majority man defense,” Mitchell said. “They can take a lot of switches because they’re basically all the same size, so we just have to make the right reads out of that. We have to trust and make the extra pass.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the

The 21-year-old was eager to go into the coaching profession soon after he graduated, but he didn’t know where to start, so he called around waiting for his opportunity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Williams would go on to put together a wonderful program over his 19-year tenure, becoming the winningest coach in UCSB history, registering a record of 313-260 while bringing home three Big West Championships, three NCAA appearances and three Big West Coach of the Year awards.</p>\n<p>However, all good things must come to an end. After an abysmal 6-22 record, which included a 4-12 conference record and a last-place finish in the Big West, the Gauchos were forced to move on to something new.</p>\n<p>And just as Williams was brought in to revamp a program that was going through some struggles, a young 39-year-old associate head coach from the University of Arizona was hired and introduced on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, to bring glory back to UCSB basketball.</p>\n<p>Over that same span, Pasternack built a solid resume of coaching gigs, ranging from being an assistant at Cal from 2000-2007 to being the youngest Head Coach in college basketball at age 30 when he took over for the University of New Orleans to his latest job at Arizona.</p>\n<p>All that coaching, all that stress, all that fun came to fruition on that fateful Tuesday when he was given the keys to a program he called a “sleeping giant” on Gaucho alum Jim Rome’s radio show the day of his introduction.</p>\n<p>Despite taking over a program that did put forth some of its worst basketball in decades in terms of record — with the aforementioned 6-22 overall record and missing the Big West tournament for the first time since 1998 — the New Orleans native is not afraid to come into UCSB and put his name and stamp on this institution’s basketball program.</p>\n<p>“I think with any program, culture is the number-one priority, and culture isn’t just something you write on a piece of paper or put on a wall,” Pasternack said. “It’s your process on a daily basis and how you structure your workouts and hold yourselves accountable and taking advantage of all opportunities UC Santa Barbara has to offer.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things that are known about Santa Barbara is not only the beaches and beauty but the brains behind a school that ranks among the top public universities in the nation — something that coach Pasternack values and beliefs will be a big factor in the rebuilding of the basketball program.</p>\n<p>“To take advantage of getting an incredible education here and to graduate and be set up for the rest of your life, that’s part of the culture we want to instill here,” Pasternack said. “We plan on honoring the process, and honoring the process isn’t about the results but what it takes to get the results on a daily basis. We don’t want to just be Big West Champions; we want to be champions in all facets.”</p>\n<p>Not many coaches have had the track record Pasternack has been able to attain in such a short amount of time. The Indiana alum is set to turn 40 on April 15, yet he has already received great tutelage under Knight, a winner of over 900 college basketball games, the second most in NCAA Division I history, and Sean Miller, the current coach at Arizona who has made three Elite Eight appearances, six Sweet 16 appearances and has brought home two Pac-12 Championships.</p>\n<p>“The past six years at Arizona under Sean, who is a future Hall of Fame coach, and learning his system and being able to put together all the information I’ve learned over the past 20 years and picking out what I want to do best with my personality for our system to fit our personnel has been invaluable,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>Along with that, Pasternack also has the advantage of this being his second head coaching job. While at New Orleans, Pasternack often struggled, amassing only a 38-54 overall record in four seasons; however, it should be noted that Pasternack was facing many problems during his tenure there, as he was helping rebuild a team that was affected by Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited that I did have that opportunity in New Orleans,” Pasternack said. “I was 30 years old and I made a million mistakes as a young coach, and that is really helping me today in putting together a program, building a staff and managing a team the right way.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons Pasternack was such a sought-after coach was because of his recruiting experience.</p>\n<p>While at Arizona the past six seasons, Pasternack helped land the Wildcats a top-10 recruiting class, including a top-five recruiting class in four of those six years and was ranked as the 12th best recruiter in college basketball by ESPN last fall.</p>\n<p>The former Cal assistant has built many different connections over the last 18 years, including many different international connects that have helped him land great players such as Lauri Markkanen who declared for the NBA draft after a wonderful freshman year this past season attaining First Team All Pac-12 after averaging 15.6 points per game and 7.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are in need of some young talent that can come in and contribute right away, considering junior guard Gabe Vincent will most likely still not be ready for the start of next year and losing senior guard Eric Childress to graduation.</p>\n<p>“Recruiting has been great so far,” Pasternack said. “We are receiving an incredible amount of interest from transfers, California kids, international guys and me being able to use my connections I’ve built over 18 years is really paying dividends right now.”</p>\n<p>As a mid-major, part of UCSB’s road to success will be to build a very valuable home crowd, something that has dwindled over the last few years.</p>\n<p>A stadium that holds 5,600 people, the Thunderdome only averaged 1,587 seats filled per home game, with the highest crowd being against rival Cal Poly, a game UCSB won, which had 3,306 people in attendance.</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence that teams with large home crowds tend to do the best, especially when it comes to conference play.</p>\n<p>Pasternack wants to bolster this through the team’s rebuilding and would be aided by having a strong non-conference schedule to have the crowd constantly anxious throughout the season, and not just when the Mustangs come to town.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of games that have already been scheduled, even before I got here, but we want to bring an exciting game to the Thunderdome. Personally, I want to dive head first with the students, it is my number one priority to be available to the students,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>“I want to go on-campus, hand out the free tickets and get to know them because our success is tied to their interest in our program. The best mid-majors in the country have dominant home courts, their students are a huge part of why they win, and I want to figure out what we can do to make this a great home court environment.”</p>\n<p>It is clear one of Pasternack’s priorities is the rebuilding of this program. But he, like most adults, also has other priorities that keep him busy like having a family. Pasternack is a father to two kids, one boy, and one girl, who he loves very much. They are his fun, and they are his go-to during his free time. His son Joe IV loves basketball just like his father, while his daughter, Lilly, currently enjoys gymnastics.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76631\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76631\" data-attachment-id=\"76631\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/pasternack-aims-to-wake-sleeping-giant/mbball_pressconf_jorgemercado_img_6139/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=1088%2C1632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1088,1632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76631\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139-683x1024.jpg?resize=291%2C437\" alt=\"\" width=\"291\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?w=1088&amp;ssl=1 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joe Pasternack poses with his family during a press conference. <em>Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I don’t have a lot of interests,” Pasternack chuckles. “My life is basketball and my family.

Thursday to remain near the top of the Big West standings. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson scored eight of the final 10 points for the Gauchos to hold off a late rally by the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara improved to 15-6 overall and 6-2 in the Big West with the victory, remaining a half game behind UC Irvine (7-2) in the conference standings. Hawaii followed up with a victory over Cal Poly on Saturday and sits at 5-4 in the conference and 16-7 overall.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took an early advantage in the first half, leading by as many as nine points before UCSB closed the gap to a 37-34 halftime score in favor of the home team. Both teams traded blows in the opening minutes of the second half before the Gauchos began to take the game over.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Trailing 44-43, Santa Barbara went on a 12-2 run to take nine-point lead. Hawaii closed the deficit to three midway through the second half, but would never get any closer as the Gauchos slowly pulled away late in the game.</p>\n<p>With just under four minutes remaining and the Gauchos leading by six, Bryson took the game over, making a pair of free throws and three-point baskets to score eight of the final 10 points for UCSB and close out the game. Bryson finished the game with 18 points, second most in the contest of any player.</p>\n<p>Per As usual, junior center Alan Williams led UCSB by posting his 10th double-double of the season with 20 points and 17 rebounds. The reigning Big West Player of the Week ranks seventh in the nation in scoring (23.1 ppg) and is third in rebounds per game (11.4 rpg). In addition, Big Al tallied five blocked shots and ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 13 points, 10 coming in the first half alone. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon scored all 10 of his points in the second half on an efficient 4-5 shooting night.</p>\n<p>A pair of forwards in sophomore Isaac Fotu and senior Christian Standhardinger led Hawaii. Fotu finished the game with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Standhardinger totaled 15 points and nine boards.</p>\n<p>With the rebounding and turnover margins relatively similar, this game came down to the shooting of both teams. The Gauchos were 8-22 shooting from beyond the arc compared to just 3-19 for the Rainbow Warriors and made the same amount of field goals despite 11 fewer shot attempts.</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Then, at five years old, she made her first basket all by herself and instantly knew basketball was the right path for her.</p>\n<p>“My brother used to always say, ‘Look at the front of the rim and just shoot it.’ I did it one time and it went in and I was so excited,” Mason said. “I ran in and told my dad, ‘I made it! I made it!’ Right there, I was like ‘I want to do this.’”</p>\n<p>Just like that, Mason was enthralled with the game of basketball.</p>\n<p>“I was outside all the time … all the time,” Mason said. “Every chance I could get, I was playing with guys and playing with people older than me.”</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to college, where Mason is playing for the UCSB women’s basketball team. The passionate little kid who grew up wanting to play professionally is still inside her and evident to all around her.</p>\n<p>“She’s the first one in the gym most of the time and the last one out of here, always grabbing the freshmen to spend extra time with them on their skills,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She’s just a basketball junkie. That’s the fun part of it — she eats, breathes, lives and is passionate about the game.”</p>\n<p>Now in her senior year, Mason is experiencing a breakout season. While not known for her offense in previous years, Mason is one of the three seniors anchoring the Gaucho attack this year, which has seen tremendous improvement from previous seasons. The senior guard ranks third on the team in scoring at 12.8 points per game, shooting an impressive 42.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Destini on the court is not too different than Destini off the court — just very, very high energy,” teammate Nicole Nesbit said. “She’s a very passionate player. She’s very into the game. You can see it all over her face when she plays.”</p>\n<p>Entering this season, Mason’s career-high was 13 points. That total has been shattered on four separate occasions, the most recent coming during UCSB’s first Big West game of the year at rival Cal Poly where Mason totaled 24 points. She also broke her career-high in field goals made as she went 10-17 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly game foreshadowed good things to come during conference play for Mason. Despite the team’s struggle, Mason has continued to improve during Big West play.</p>\n<p>Mason increased her field goal percentage to 46.9 percent and has elevated her game from long range, knocking down six three-pointers, which is just one shy of her total from nonconference play. She’s also upped her percentage from behind the arc from 31.8 percent to 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“Destini is a very talented player and I think she’s definitely starting to come into her own and feel confident, especially on the offensive end,” Nesbit said. “She is very good in transition; she’s a good attacker. She has good size and can usually post up smaller guards. She has a very nice mid-range jumper. She can shoot the three as well, but doesn’t as often. She’s a complete offensive player and I think she’s starting to believe that.”</p>\n<p>However, Mason is much more than a scorer. It may not show up in the box scores, but since her arrival to Santa Barbara, Mason has served as the defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think I just have a niche for defense,” Mason said. “Defense is just really about heart, which I have, and not wanting to get scored on, which I have, and (then some) positioning, technique and strength.”</p>\n<p>Yet, possibly the biggest asset Mason has given to the Gauchos this season is her versatility. With an undersized roster, Mitchell has often moved the 5’8’’ Mason to the power forward position, although Mason has been known to play positions one through four all season long.</p>\n<p>“I like watching the game and I think that’s why, being a four player this year, it came kind of easy because I watch it so much,” Mason said. “It just came natural because I knew their positioning and what they were looking for.”</p>\n<p>The transition has actually aided Mason who, as a guard, leads the team in rebounding with 6.0 boards per game. She also averages 0.9 steals and 0.5 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“Just having so many players (from Rutgers) that are in the [WNBA], I tell her that she has to be great at everything,” Mitchell said. “You can’t just do one thing well to be a WNBA player, so I just challenge her every day to be a complete player and not just one-dimensional and I think her versatility will give her a look.”</p>\n<p>Altogether, Mason seems to be making the strongest case she can to the WNBA. Add all of Mason’s accomplishments together along with the fact that she serves as the team’s vocal leader this season and Mason easily makes a case for the most improved player under Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of those that it’s the reason you coach, and you smile because I can remember walking into this gym for my first skill workouts and I saw her sitting in the corner, but at that point she had asked for her release and was transferring from UCSB,” Mitchell said. “That’s what you want from young women is for them to mature and grow and be independent and confident in who they are as an individual and as a basketball player. So, you have to smile for her now being out there confident, the jokester and the ultimate leader.”</p>\n<p>If looking closely, Mason’s game actually resembles one of the great players to play in the WNBA and one of her role models: Deanna Nolan, the three-time WNBA champion and 2006 Finals MVP. Both are long guards that have incredible athleticism and while not the flashiest players, make a substantial mark on every game.</p>\n<p>“[Nolan] would jump out of the gym. The elevation on her jumper was ungodly,” Mitchell said. “She also played with that little cocky edge, which I’m okay with, and I think all the great players have somewhat. Some people could misread it, but to me it shows she’s passionate; she plays with a level of excitement that you don’t take that away from players.”</p>\n<p>But as a student of the game, Nolan isn’t the only player that can be seen in Mason’s game. When looking closely, you might see pieces of a pair of L.A. Laker guards.</p>\n<p>“I copied a lot of people, but that’s okay because that’s how you get better,” Mason said. “I take bits and pieces of a lot of different players, so [Nolan] definitely with the way she flows with the offense with the ball.
