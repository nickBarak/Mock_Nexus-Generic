Thus the</em> </em><em>taking into custody of Deleveau on March 9 was a detention only, and not an arrest.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE 4/10:</strong> Although Otis Dezjuan Washington identified himself as such, he is currently not enrolled as a UCSB student as initially reported in the press release.</em></p>\n<p>Last night, a stabbing occurred on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive at approximately 10:45 p.m., after which a large crowd surrounded the police officers who were investigating the scene and grew to become an “unlawful assembly,” resulting in the arrest of two UCSB students.</p>\n<p>The victim of the stabbing was a 20–year-old non-resident from Rhode Island, who was in Isla Vista visiting his brother, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. The perpetrator was Lompoc resident 18-year-old Kuriyan Summers-Dickinson, and the incident occurred after a fight broke out at the residence. The victim is currently in a stable condition at a local hospital, and Summers-Dickinson was arrested and charged with attempted murder, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>Following the stabbing, a large crowd accumulated around the deputies who were attending to the incident, and Isla Vista resident Otis Dezjuan Washington was found jumping on top of vehicles and arrested for “vehicle tampering and resisting arrest.” As police arrested Washington, more people crowded around the deputies and “began chanting and throwing bottles,” according to the press release, eventually resulting in an unlawful assembly with an estimated one thousand people. Law enforcement pushed back the crowd, using pepper spray and batons on those who refused to leave, resulting in the arrest of UCSB student Tomas Delaveau for battery on a peace officer.</p>\n<p>Public Information Specialist for the SB County Sheriff’s Office Kelly Hoover maintained that the crowd would not be considered a riot, but that it risked becoming one.</p>\n<p>“It was an unlawful assembly which could have turned into a riot,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the crowd assembled as a result of being intrigued by Washington’s arrrest, and began shouting things like “Let him go,” and “Fuck the police.”</p>\n<p>“I believe they just saw that someone was being arrested, and they gathered around the deputies who were making the arrested and the handcuffed student,” Hoover said. “I think when it started out it was a couple hundred people, and then as they saw there was something happening more and more people gathered.”</p>\n<p>Hoover expressed frustration with the behavior of the crowd, saying the crowd restricted the law enforcement’s ability to keep the area safe.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing that when law enforcement is out there trying to keep people safe, to have individuals who are making that effort more difficult and being disrespectful to our law enforcement,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>A fourth-year resident of the 6600 block of Del Playa who requested to remain anonymous said she was disappointed with the crowd’s response to the police, given their role in keeping the community safe.</p>\n<p>“It is completely disrespectful and shameful for the crowd to have yelled such insults to our police officers, the ones who are working to control crimes such as the horrific rape that occurred this month. I’d like to feel safe in my community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Photos Courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Sunday, March 9, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/","id":3789,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3788,3787,3786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Trump Declares State of Emergency in Calif., FEMA Will Fund Most Costs for Firefighting Efforts","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2017-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-101-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-101-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"FEMA will cover over 75 percent of firefighting costs in areas affected by the fire, according to Brandi Richard, FEMA spokesperson.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald J.

Officials also arrested two unrelated individuals for simultaneous incidents of shoplifting and battery, as reported by the owner of the 7-Eleven on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sheriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino, a strong-armed robbery occurred on El Greco Road at approximately 1:45 a.m. on Saturday. Plastino said the victim reports two males coming up to him on El Greco and hitting him repeatedly on the head.</p>\n<p>“He was knocked to the ground and when he asked what they wanted, they said ‘cash,’” Plastino said. “He gave them $40 from his wallet and the suspects fled toward UCSB.”</p>\n<p>The victim was not injured but was only able to give a limited description of his assailants, so police officers were unable to arrest anyone in connection with the incident. A UCSB emergency e-mail alert was sent to warn students of the incident and ask the public for further information.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at approximately 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, deputies intercepted and apprehended a suspected team of burglars, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“[California Highway Patrol] Officers observed a green GMC Envoy traveling northbound on Embarcadero Del Norte with one headlight out … and stopped the vehicle,” Plastino said. “IVFP deputies joined and contacted the people in the car. All were from Oxnard.”</p>\n<p>Upon checking their identities, officers discovered that two of the men had arrest warrants from Ventura County. The men were arrested and officers conducted a search on the car, which revealed several burglary tools including pry bars, cutting devices, flash lights, gloves and puncture tools. Officers also discovered a marijuana pipe, two methamphetamine pipes, a small supply of methamphetamine, three hypodermic syringes and Xanax.</p>\n<p>Plastino said officers recovered what appeared to be stolen goods, including eight cell phones and an Espana guitar in a black case that appeared to belong to an SBCC student.</p>\n<p>“All four men were arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of hypodermic syringes, possession of prescripted meds without prescription [and] possession of stolen property,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, according to Plastino, deputies also arrested an intoxicated subject who was jumping on the rear trunk of a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p>“When I asked why he jumped on the vehicle, his response was, ‘Because I’m intoxicated and making bad choices,’” Plastino said. “The suspect had his older brother’s identification inside his wallet. When asked why he had his brother’s ID, the suspect responded, ‘to buy alcohol of course.’”</p>\n<p>Although Plastino said “the level of honesty was very rare,” the suspect was arrested for being drunk in public, minor in possession, causing damage to another’s vehicle and possession of someone else’s identification.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/","id":3787,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3786,3785,3784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, a college-aged male subject was arrested on Friday night for the possession of anti-anxiety medications without a prescription.

When they arrived to the residence, officers found the injured suspect, who is 19-20 years old, at the base of a staircase as well as a victim nearby, according to Signa. He also said the victim was pointing at the injured suspect and saying the suspect was “kicking subjects as they attempted to walk up the stairs.”</p>\n<p>“The suspect was arrested for battery and booked into jail,” Signa said. “It is unknown whether the suspect was a student or not.”</p>\n<p>In addition, deputies responded to a call from the 6700 block of Del Playa reporting a residential burglary that had occurred sometime between the previous night and early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect entered the victim’s residence from an unlocked front door,” Signa said. “Two laptops — both MacBook Pros — were taken and the investigation is continuing.”</p>\n<p>A second burglary was also reported early Sunday morning from the apartment complexes at 781 Embarcadero Del Norte, with the incident involving the theft of three Apple Macbook Pro laptop computers from an apartment living room at 5 a.m.</p>\n<p>“One of the [female] victims heard someone moving around in the apartment and called 9-1-1,” Signa said. “Neighbors saw a suspect loitering around the apartment building before the theft [and] described [him] as a large athletic, black male adult about 6’2, wearing a black hoodie.
