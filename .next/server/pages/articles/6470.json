In my two years as a news editor, I have been responsible for most, if not all, story pitches regarding students of color, and it has always been a fight to explain why the stories I pitched were necessary, and why the perspective I brought as a person of color to the paper was necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past two years, the few editors of color on staff took it upon ourselves to lead frank discussions within the newsroom, the news team and with leadership about the lack of diversity on staff and what we need to be doing better with our coverage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By no means am I saying that the work I or other editors did was enough — the Nexus has historically failed students of color on this campus, and to say that a few individuals cycling through the office could fix that would be disingenuous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journalism industry at large struggles with these same issues, and without institutional change at the Nexus, and with the high turnover of a college newsroom, nothing will change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organization that demands accountability and transparency from every entity on campus, the Nexus needs to uphold these same standards. After speaking with other journalists of color and from my familiarity with work in other newsrooms, these are a few recommendations that I’m leaving behind. They are by no means the fullest extent of what the Nexus should be doing, but a few places to start. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish yearly or quarterly data on the diversity of the editorial staff.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a formal Diversity and Inclusion Board made up of members of the editorial staff as well as outside representatives. (The Daily Texan has a good reference for a Diversity and Inclusion board </span><a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2019/02/03/introducing-the-texans-raising-voices-initiatives-same-paper-new-commitment-to-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The goal of this board should be to serve as an internal resource for staffers and to oversee diversity initiatives. These should be paid positions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Nexus version of this </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uk0LrP2iM22rY39quqJZBZOstFNAGirJd5KH9hjRAKo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidelines for Inclusive Journalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document from the Seattle Times Diversity &amp; Inclusion Task Force and hold a mandatory staff-wide meeting to distribute it to all current and future editorial staff members and go over the content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate time and resources to doing intentional outreach to students of color and the many student-led organizations on campus that create spaces for students of color. Reach out to student leaders, ask to speak at meetings and open yourself up to feedback and criticism. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertise the opinion section, specifically the op-ed and letter to the editor columns, more broadly and more proactively so that the section reflects a diverse set of voices beyond just its consistent writers. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not enough for the Nexus to just undertake these initiatives to bring more staffers and editors of color into the newsroom. The Nexus, and its white leadership in particular, needs to be more conscientious about how to support these staffers and editors once they join the newsroom, and to listen to what they’re saying, even if it makes them uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus’ white leadership also needs to spend time educating themselves about race, and fostering conversations within the newsroom at large about how students of color are being covered. The newsroom cannot make progress if the Nexus tokenizes the editors of color that are on staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, I really naively thought that the Nexus was immune to the problems that plagued this industry. I know better now, and I ask that the Nexus takes these steps and more to do better for the students of color on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an outgoing editor at the Daily Nexus.

For many, this includes exploring their sex lives. It seems as though having many wild sexual encounters is an expectation of the normal male college experience, and men rarely get shamed for their Friday-night decisions. And yet, I see women being shamed all the time for having similar experiences. Words like “hoe,” “thot” and “bitch” are used every day around Isla Vista. The idea of a girl “giving it up easily” and thus being “easy” is seen as an absolute atrocity, yet the more girls a man can bed, the better.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, I don’t believe that the idea of having sex with random strangers multiple times a day on a regular basis should be a celebrated norm for anybody. This is for many reasons, but namely because sex is often such a personal and emotional experience and because of legitimate health risks associated with this activity (namely STIs). However, I also believe that neither my, nor anyone else’s, personal feelings about sex should affect anyone else’s choices. I think that a lot of girls make decisions about sex that they wouldn’t make otherwise because they feel judged or shamed by society. For instance, I know a lot of girls who are concerned about keeping their “number” down in order to avoid having a high “body count,” meaning that they deny themselves the full range of sexual experiences they desire to have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sick of the idea that a girl isn’t the “bring-home-to-mom type” because she makes even a third of the choices that a man might make regarding sex. I am sick of seeing men get high-fives for behavior that would earn a woman a reputation that could follow them around for the rest of their lives. I am sick of hearing horrible stories about the “hoe” or “school bike” of people’s high school classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sick of the fact that the guys that choose to be especially promiscuous often shame the very girls they are involved with. At the very least, they should respect these women who are making the exact same choices as them. Of course, I hope that all women respect themselves and make choices that they are comfortable and content with. Everyone should hold themselves accountable for taking care of themselves and making healthy choices. And yet, we shouldn’t make it our business to tear down those who we see doing things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is entitled to and has a right to their personal preferences and beliefs, but must we always make other people’s business our business? We are all on our own paths, learning from our own decisions. Your body is your choice.

American students of all ages live in rational fear of gun violence, and yet very little has changed to protect them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2020 was the </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-first-march-without-school-shooting-since-2002-united-states/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first March in nearly two decades without a school shooting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the United States, not because of groundbreaking gun control legislation, but assumedly because of campus closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Simply shutting down schools seems to be the only way to prevent further shootings, as government regulation of firearms has been historically inefficient in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the rate of mass public shootings have fallen, the pandemic has brought on its own host of gun-related problems. Recent state-wide lockdowns have required the closure of all nonessential businesses. Those businesses that are allowed to stay open provide essential items such as groceries, gasoline and medical care. Recently, businesses that sell firearms have manipulated their way onto that list. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many states originally ordered firearms businesses to close but immediately reversed their initial orders after being slapped with </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/buckling-pressure-many-states-deem-gun-stores-essential-allow-them-n1177706\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple lawsuits by gun rights advocates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Over the past few weeks, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjjohnsonjr/status/1238868541689880576\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long lines of customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could even be seen stretching out of the doors of some Los Angeles gun stores. Store owners are attributing this </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-gun-buyers.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 to 40% spike in sales</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entirely to the virus scare and are now typically selling as many as 300 firearms a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But guns will not make Americans any safer in the face of COVID-19. In fact, these panic-fueled purchases are just inciting more violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overall crime has declined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the pandemic, </span><a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2020/05/21/pandemic-quieted-public-shootings-but-not-gun-violence-arizona-westgate/5238089002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gun violence has not</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Similarly, Philadelphia is seeing a </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-gun-violence-double-public-health-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% increase in homicide shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to last year. Many city leaders fear that, with increased possession of firearms and ammunition, the number of shootings may only increase further once lockdowns are lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidental shootings due to new possession of firearms are also on the rise. In Albuquerque, a man was arrested for </span><a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1434623/man-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-13-yr-old-cousin.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accidentally shooting and killing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his 13-year-old cousin. He told detectives that he was arming himself for protection amidst the coronavirus scare and hadn’t realized that his shotgun was loaded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, this influx in gun sales may be contributing to a decline in home safety. In Houston, </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-domestic-violence-victims-stay-at-home-orders-do-not-offer-safety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">domestic violence calls have increased by 6%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the month of March and were up by 21% percent in Phoenix. This trend is reverberating throughout the nation, as </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay-at-home orders are proving to be a danger for domestic violence victims, which is only exacerbated by the presence of a gun in the home. In Pennsylvania, a man reportedly </span><a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-latest-roderick-bliss-shoots-longtime-girlfriend-kills-self-after-being-extremely-upset-about-pandemic-losing-job-wilson-police-say/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot his girlfriend and then himself</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after losing his job due to the pandemic. Incidents like these, in which family members are the target of gun violence, are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, firearms have become a symbol of apocalyptic panic in this pandemic. Gun-toting protesters have flocked to state legislatures, in clear defiance of stay-at-home orders.

The fact that Americans believe that buying guns is a logical form of protection from this pandemic clearly indicates the growth of this mass hysteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increase in violence, if anything, should highlight the importance of gun control legislation. Now, exactly six years since the Isla Vista tragedy sparked activism in our own Santa Barbara community, gun violence remains as prevalent an issue as ever. For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Kocis rejects the labeling of firearms businesses as essential and pushes for greater gun control legislation.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

due to the stay-at-home orders following the spread of COVID-19, many of us suddenly have much more time on our hands. If you’re like me, you’ve been spending the vast majority of this time watching more Netflix than you’ve ever watched in your life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you view a movie every other night or five episodes of Grey’s Anatomy per day, binge watching streamable content has been a great source of comfort during these trying times. Indeed, research shows that </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix usage has risen at least 16%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since the first COVID-19 case in the US, revealing an increasing reliance on film and television media to help us through the dark reality of a global pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some, spending so much precious time consuming mindless content may seem like a waste of energy.

Mar and Keith Oatley </span><a href=\"http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2010_01.dir/pdfc8vBXO7Maa.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write in their study on “the function of fiction,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> narrative fiction “[offers] models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simplification, and compression…[creating] a deep immersive simulative experience of social interactions for [the audience].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is slightly depressing to consider, absorbing Netflix’s character-driven teen dramedies like “Never Have I Ever” and “The Half of It” may help us to subconsciously practice social interaction in a time when our in-person conversations are entirely limited to mealtime chats with family members or housemates. In its own way, Netflix’s original content is preparing us for a post-isolation world, when we will have to relearn how to interact with people other than the members of our household in order to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/4/16/21213635/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-legacy-quarantine-state-of-mind-frugality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break out of the “quarantine state of mind.”</span></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn down the lights, brew some tea and grab your favorite snack, because if there’s one curve we don’t need to worry about flattening in these trying times, it’s Netflix usage.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this “immersive simulative experience” to the extreme, Dan Olson of the YouTube channel Folding Ideas revealed in </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsSzrVhdVuw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his March 31 video “I Can’t Stop Watching Contagion”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has watched the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contagion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “over fifteen times in the last few weeks.” He is not alone in this grim fascination, for he reports that “according to Netflix, at the time of writing, it is the second most-watched thing in Canada.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem like a self-destructive plot to amplify anxiety, but as Olson puts it, “watching a disaster film in a disaster [exposes us] to what we’re already experiencing. Amplifying existing emotional states, it works as a form of emotional inoculation. I am scared and anxious and uncertain, and so I will make myself more scared and more anxious and more uncertain, because it’s still fiction. It’s still safe. It still has an end.
