It also facilitates educational outreach initiatives regarding LGBTQ members to the general community and has helped in putting on drag shows, educational workshops and lecturing and speaking events.</p>\n<p>Out of the $2.12 collected in the Queer Commission’s new fee, $0.53 will be for a 25 percent return-to-aid, $0.10 will be for a 7 percent administrative assessment collected on all non-capital expenditures, $0.01 will be for the 1 percent A.S. recharge fee and $1.48 will be given directly to the Queer Commission.</p>\n<p>According to Dave Whitman, Interim Director of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), the Queer Commission hit a “breaking point” last year when its budget was proposed to be cut to an “all-time low.” Whitman said the group decided to propose the fee initiative to tackle these budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“This year, instead of going to Senate to ask them to not approve the cutting of their budget anymore, they decided to go straight to the entire student body for support,” Whitman said. “This way, the student body can decide collectively if a strong Queer Commission is valuable to this campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the Queer Commission Andrew Farkash said the purpose of the initiative is to not only gain funding to hold events but also give students a chance to attend LGBTQ national conferences for education and personal growth.</p>\n<p>“It teaches students about a lot of different issues and gets them more involved in the activism, in the commission and in the community in general,” Farkash said.</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, the lack of funding for the Queer Commission has negatively affected LGBTQ organizations on campus by impacting regularly held events, activities and meetings.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to give out less money, so it’s kind of hurt their events because the Queer Commission exists mainly to support the queer community and the different queer organizations,” Farkash said. “We’re also hurting … their ability to have regular events, to have regular meetings, to keep interest in their members, to advocate on campus and so on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/","id":3032,"author":{"id":188,"name":"Dustin Chan"},"related":[3031,3030,3029],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":188,"name":"Dustin Chan","biography":"Not available","articles":[3032],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

The SAG candidates discussed topics such as student outreach plans.</p></div>\n<p>Last night, prospective candidates for Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, and Student Advocate General gathered in the Hub to debate their plans and ideas in this year’s A.S. electoral race.</p>\n<p>The Open People’s Party and the Democratic Process Party presented candidates for EVPSA and EVPLA, while Bailey Loverin and Amir Khazaieli entered the debate for SAG as independents, as they are required to be. Members of the Elections Committee moderated the debates, fielding questions from audience members to the candidates and touching on topics related to a candidate’s core values and party ties, as well as their opinions of existing projects and practices within A.S.</p>\n<p><b>EVPLA Debate</b></p>\n<p>For the position of EVPLA, which deals with community affairs in Isla Vista and Goleta, OPP’s Beatrice Contreras debated with DP’s Daniela Bayon. Contreras has worked as an Off-Campus Senator for the past year, while Bayon has been heavily involved in Isla Vista Community Relations Committee and has worked to develop a landlord-rating website that is expected to go online later this quarter. The two candidates professed similar agendas, proclaiming their determination to focus on sexual assault and hate crime prevention, housing fairness, communication with law enforcement and community centers in Isla Vista, among other issues.</p>\n<p>When asked about increasing safety in Isla Vista, Contreras said she would set up a board of students that would keep close contact with police and foot patrol in order to keep students both informed and included in law enforcement decision-making.</p>\n<p>“There needs to be a lot more communication with Isla Vista Foot Patrol, and one thing I have as a specific platform is to create a law enforcement advisory board so that we can all sit down and talk about what our community policing priorities are,” Contreras said. “We can have students, non-students, community members and police officers.”</p>\n<p>Contreras also advocated implementing a rape crisis center in Isla Vista. Bayon, in her answer to the same question, proposed creating a legal complaint coordinator, in addition to a center in I.V. for those who felt harassed or assaulted.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest issues with safety in Isla Vista is issues dealing with women and men — all folks — on sexual violence,” Bayon said. “This space will be a space for all students and survivors of sexual assault to go and have a safe space on Friday nights and on Saturday nights.”</p>\n<p>In regards to Deltopia, which drew in roughly 10,000 more people than last year based on County officials’ estimates, Bayon said that while she agreed with increased efforts for open communication with law enforcement, she also said some communities do not feel safe working with police.</p>\n<p>Bayon and Contreras differed slightly on their opinions of the proposed fee increase for renovations to the University Center, called the Student Union Revitalization Fund. While Contreras said she fully supported the fee, Bayon said she believed more work needed to be done on the project before the fee was passed.</p>\n<p>According to Contreras, budget constraints on the university mean that students have no choice but to fund the project themselves.</p>\n<p>“I definitely do agree with the UCen lock-in fee,” Contreras said. “Although it’s a shame and we shouldn’t have to raise student fees, it’s important to be faced with the reality that there are budget cuts going on … we really need to work with what we have … we need to provide those services for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, before the SURF fee passes, the people in charge of the project should work with a larger number of student groups to devise a more universally beneficial plan.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard a lot of different mixed feelings from a lot of community members and a lot of students and a lot of BCCs on campus,” Bayon said. “I think that this UCen lock-in fee needs more work.”</p>\n<p>When asked to explain the ways in which they had worked to support students of color and queer students on campus, Bayon said she has consistently been an advocate of inclusive language, expanding safe-zone training to police and residence halls. She also mentioned her earning of a Gender and Diversity requirement, rather than a European Traditions requirement, while Contreras said her efforts include advocating for a Gender and Sexuality general education requirement. Both candidates cited their experiences as women of color.</p>\n<p>During the EVPLA debate, Bayon stressed the Rate My Landlord project as one specific goal she hopes to accomplish by both getting the site running and setting up a system for it to continue in future years. On the other hand, Contreras talked about developing a community center in Isla Vista that would serve both students and non-students alike, although A.S. just recently launched a similar project called the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p><b>EVPSA Debate </b></p>\n<p>The second debate last night pitted OPP’s Melvin Singh against DP’s Kashira “Kash” Ayers for A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, which deals with statewide issues in higher education, such as UC budget cuts, and student lobbying and organizing.</p>\n<p>Questions focused on the appointment of Janet Napolitano, the United States Student Association, the California Master Plan for Education and its revision project, plans for working with other UC campuses, collaborations with legislators, the California budget for education and party alignment. The candidates come from different backgrounds, with Singh having worked with Student Lobby and the Office of the EVPSA, and Ayers holding experience in organizing and lobbying with the Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>When asked about UC President Janet Napolitano, both candidates said they had a problem with her appointment, although they differed in their approaches to moving forward with her. Ayers said she would focus on organizing student talks with Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“I would like to acknowledge that I do have a problem with the appointment of Janet Napolitano,” Ayers said. “As students at this university, we should have a say in who our UC president should be. … As EVPSA, I will work with her in hosting forums that are open to all students.”</p>\n<p>Singh said he would continue ongoing negotiations with Napolitano, saying he felt optimistic based on her reception to past demands.</p>\n<p>“I don’t approve of Janet Napolitano’s past … however, she is in the position right now where she is a public figure,” Singh said. “Compared to past UC presidents, she is more of a politician and more indebted to our needs. … She’s been very receptive since her appointment. I’ve seen her engage with students, and I hope to continue that.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the first issues the candidates will tackle if elected, Ayers said she would focus on voter registration and organizing forums for students who are unable to vote, while Singh said he would focus on securing stable costs tuition and preventing another tuition hike.</p>\n<p>When asked about the state of the United States Student Association, Ayers and Singh both said it can be a powerful tool for student lobbying.</p>\n<p>“As students, we have power in numbers,” Ayers said. “USSA is effective because it builds a strong coalition of students that can network inside of these spaces and outside of it …We need to get more students there, especially first- and second-year students.”</p>\n<p>As for the California Master Plan for Education, Singh said he supported efforts to revise the Master Plan based on a changing context for California.</p>\n<p>“The problem with it now is that it’s not clearly defined for all students,” Singh said. “I’m totally supportive of pushing the Master Plan across California … I’m very optimistic about it, and it’s something I will back up as EVPSA.”</p>\n<p>Moderators asked candidates which aspects of the budget each candidate would focus on advocating for, given current budget constraints. Ayers said she would focus on increasing financial aid, increasing diversity on campus and allocating more money towards resources for students such as psychological services. Singh said he would focus on affordability and accessibility.</p>\n<p>Both candidates were asked why they chose to run with their respective parties. Ayers, although maintaining that she does not believe in party lines, named several factors that drew her to the Democratic Process Party. In particular, she mentioned the fact that DP has an open, democratic primary for electing candidates while OPP does an interview process to select individuals.</p>\n<p>“Parties can be abrasive sometimes, but I chose the Democratic Process Party for the simple fact that they have an open primary,” Ayers said. “It’s issue-oriented and action-based, and it’s a progressive party,”</p>\n<p>Singh said he chose to run with the Open People’s Party mainly based on its means of achieving policy goals.</p>\n<p>“OPP happens to have the methods and the actions that I agree with, when it comes to enacting the opinions that I have,” Singh said.</p>\n<p><b>SAG Debate</b></p>\n<p>The third and final debate of the evening occurred between Bailey Loverin and Amir Khazaieli, independent candidates for Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>Loverin has worked for the past year as the Chief of Staff in the current Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), while Khazaieli has sat on Senate for the past two years as the collegiate senator for the College of Engineering. Debate questions touched on how each candidate would balance transparency and confidentiality, restructure the office, resist conflict with personal interest, combat sexism and racism and plan for student outreach.</p>\n<p>In terms of its structure, the OSA currently has the SAG, a Chief of Staff and four divisional departments — each with two caseworkers. The departments at present are housing, academic, public interest and student conduct.</p>\n<p>If elected, Loverin said she will replace one of the caseworkers in each department with a program director responsible for outreach efforts. She also said she will add a program director at the level of Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, Khazaieli said he plans to first hire entry-level fellows who are not initially affiliated with a specific department but do casework. Khazaieli then said he will add a position in charge of transparency at the level of Chief of Staff and alter the divisions to be on-campus housing, off-campus housing, campus policy and non-university legal issues.</p>\n<p>Regarding issues of sexism and racism, Loverin said she will increase the role of the public interest division, which serves to help and support student groups and is a department added in the office just this past year.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to push them to work with S.C.O.R.E. and other campus organizations that deal with these issues,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli, more work needs to be done in regards to discrimination and efforts should be completed in collaboration with A.S. groups. He said he will do everything in his power to defend the student bill of rights.</p>\n<p>“No matter what your affiliation or how you identify yourself, you should not be discriminated against,” Khazaieli said. “A lot more can be done with cooperation with student groups in A.S.”</p>\n<p>When each candidate was asked why he or she was the best person for the job, Loverin cited her experience as Chief of Staff.</p>\n<p>“I have the hands-on experience in the office,” Loverin said. “I’ve been dedicating my entire year to this … I also have contacts with administrators… But what’s really important here is that I care about this position — I love this position and I want to serve students.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Khazaieli said he understands the impact that the OSA has on students since he himself required its services when he was a first-year student. He said his previous experiences allow him to know how to best tailor the OSA to student needs.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, I got in trouble and I needed to use the Office of the Student Advocate,” Khazaieli said. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t very good advocacy; it didn’t go very well… I see the problem and I know what to fix.”</p>\n<p>In terms of outreach efforts, Loverin said she hopes to increase outreach specifically with students living in residence halls.</p>\n<p>“Right now, our biggest weakness is that students in residence halls don’t really know that we’re there … so I actually want to place caseworkers to the residence halls,” Loverin said. “I also want to … have the Student Advocate General CC’ed on all write-ups.”</p>\n<p>Referring to his experience as a Senator involved in spearheading the Pardall Center in Isla Vista, Khazaieli said he has already worked with outreach and would continue such efforts.</p>\n<p>“I worked this year … setting up what is, right now, the only community center in Isla Vista,” Khazaieli said. “I think I’ve demonstrated good fortitude in the ability to outreach.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, April 16, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54865\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/a-s-candidates-debate-goals-plans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54865\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/a-s-candidates-debate-goals-plans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/a-s-candidates-debate-goals-plans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/a-s-candidates-debate-goals-plans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/a-s-candidates-debate-goals-plans/","id":3029,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3028,3027,3026],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prospective A.S.

Senator Candidates to Debate Issues Ranging From Public Lighting to Mental Safety</h3>\n<p>During the Associated Students On-Campus and University-Owned Housing Senator debates, senatorial candidates for the 2014-15 academic school year congregated in the Hub yesterday to discuss their views on specific campus-related issues as well as proposed solutions and future plans.</p>\n<p>The panel consisted of 10 candidates, equally split amongst the Open-People’s Party (OPP) and the Democratic Process Party (DPP), collectively picking apart various subjects such as flaws in the dining commons and the overall effectiveness of A.S. Each candidate was allowed 30 seconds to a minute for each question asked, giving them time to argue both their party’s positions and their own personal platforms.</p>\n<p>The panel lasted for a duration of one hour and began with the discussion of the more pressing and pertinent issues on campus, with safety being first discussed.</p>\n<p>Daisy Fernandez, a first-year sociology and feminist studies major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said she sees the need for increased safety on campus through increased implementation of lighting structures. She suggested installing light structures near the tunnel by Student Health and the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>The candidates also discussed physical and mental safety of the students against issues such as homophobia and intolerant attitudes of prejudice or discrimination. According to Unique Vance, a first-year environmental science major running for On-Campus senator with DPP, students should not feel worried about the security of their own homes at UCSB and should receive consistent services that ensure their safety.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people feel unsafe in their own dorms and their own homes, and that should not be an issue,” Vance said. “I really want to include more safe places for students in their own homes so that they can feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Also at the debate, candidates discussed UCSB students’ well-being as well as higher availability of exercise classes at the Recreation Center and workshops on health. In addition, they touched on the topic of food quality in the dining commons.</p>\n<p>Emani Oakley, a first-year political science major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said the dining commons should accommodate more students by serving special nutritional needs, such as gluten-free diets.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I would do to improve health and wellness would be to provide more nutritional facts,” Oakley said.</p>\n<p>Tension arose within the debate when the topic of A.S.’s effectiveness and its potential improvements was brought up to candidates. Steven Kwok, a first-year economics and accounting major running for On-Campus Senator with DPP, said the organization is not quite as “associated” as he believes it should be.</p>\n<p>“To me, Associated Students … should be an organization associated with its students. But right now, it’s not doing its job,” Kwok said. “So I think how Associated Students can improve is to stop making promises it can’t keep.”</p>\n<p>Along the same vein, Alonso Martinez, a first-year mathematics major running with DPP, said he feels A.S. needs to increase efforts of transparency so students know more about their organization and their works.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make sure that the Associated Students is more transparent — that people know what’s going on,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Finally, the debate ended with short closing statements from each candidate. Third-year film &amp; media studies and black studies double major December Brown, for example, used the time to sum up her goals and restate her purpose in running for University-Owned Housing Senator with OPP.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is our home, and I would love to be a voice for all of our people,” Brown said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/","id":3030,"author":{"id":187,"name":"Daniella Chung"},"related":[3029,3028,3027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The class required students to design petitions based on their personal passions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Karmes-Wainer, that passion was healthy eating. Her health journey over the past year inspired her to make healthy eating options more accessible for UCSB students as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t believe that we have enough restaurants or establishments to build healthy, nutritious meals, and even if they seem healthy, they’re not always the healthiest option,” Karmes-Wainer said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer used the petition as a way to gauge the community’s response to the hot bar as a potential senate project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What first began as a class project quickly transformed into a platform for students with a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences to voice their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged people from other communities that I didn’t realize that I was targeting as well,” Karmes-Wainer said. “That’s the point of my position, is to hear from all my different constituents.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer’s petition elicited plenty of responses from its post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Moser, a fourth-year environmental studies major at UCSB, said his dietary restrictions made finding food on campus difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a celiac, it’s hard to find many gluten-free meal options on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just random misc snack items. As a campus senator, it would be cool if you could advocate for more meal options for those with dietary restrictions,” Moser wrote in a comment in response to Karmes-Wainer’s post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer hopes to make the bar environmentally friendly as well by using locally-sourced produce </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an idea partially borrowed from the Isla Vista Food Co-op’s model </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and compostable to-go boxes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, around 230 people have signed the petition, but the hot food bar still remains in its initial stages. Karmes-Wainer noted that the construction of the bar would not be completed by the end of her term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m dedicated to go through with the project throughout my senior year even though I won’t be on senate,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Isabell Liu is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/","id":3031,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3030,3029,3028],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
