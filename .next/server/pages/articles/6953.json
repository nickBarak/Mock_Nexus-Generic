The novel follows Shadow, a recently released convict who finds his wife has suddenly died. Without a place to go, he agrees to work for a shady man named Wednesday who shows him that gods and mythical creatures live among humans and are weakened by disbelief. The novel depicts an America that worships technology and corporate growth in place of ancient gods, creating a new form of worship that overpowers tradition. As Wednesday leads Shadow across America, Shadow prepares for a conflict of epic proportions that could change the world forever. Gaiman skillfully transforms ancient myths into fresh, modern characters while still maintaining their instantly recognizable characteristics.</p>\n<p>The novel is a bounty of personality and detail with vivid descriptions of clothes, accents and smells that give the characters intricately defined images. In this blending of two worlds, Gaiman’s matter-of-fact tone and third-person narration brings the incomprehensible talk of gods down to earth. He describes impossible concepts in simple terms and he chillingly presents horrific moments with blunt detail. In this way, narrative takes a backseat to the tone and mood of each scene and the colorful personalities met along the way.</p>\n<p>Like the drama of Greek figures in mythology or even the bickering when Superman meets Batman, each interaction between gods is an intricate character study and clashing of ideals. The novel fully pulls the reader in, however, by masterfully raising more questions than answers with every page, spreading a breadcrumb trail of plot twists that make characters unsure about their next move. With its new take on myth and exploration of what it means to be a god, <em>American Gods</em> provides a new perspective on the things America believes in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Natalie Noblett on <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> by Alida Nugent</strong><br>\nAre you equal parts terrified and excited for the future? Do you check your bank account multiple times a day and shudder at the remaining balance? Do you consider Netflix and Kirkland wine better friends than living, breathing humans? These are the types of questions Alida Nugent uses to determine if this novel is right for your life. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> accurately conveys the unfortunate truth of adulthood. It is an awkward, moneyless period of time. In a personal re-telling of her post-college years and her mastery of uncomfortable situations, Nugent is honest and candid with readers by neglecting to sugarcoat any event in her life. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em>, however, is not a depressing book about how life beyond college leaves you terrifyingly broke and drunk by 10 a.m. But, it is a <em>comedy</em> about how life beyond college leaves you terrifyingly broke and drunk by 10 a.m.! Nugent sympathizes with fellow victims of college debt and uncertainty of the future, struggling to make the petrifying leap into adulthood. What’s fresh about this novel is that there is not a satisfying, finite resolution. Like the rest of us, Nugent emphasizes that she still doesn’t have all of her shit together, and that’s okay (I mean, really, who does?). Recovering from the hopelessness of the country’s economic status after graduating, Nugent manages to make the best out of an ultimately unfortunate situation. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> is like a drunken conversation with your roommate at 2 a.m. on a Wednesday night: refreshing, blunt and uproarious.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/","id":6953,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6952,6951,6950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"‘Go Set a Watchman’: The Sequel We Didn’t Need","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Go-Set-a-Watchman.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Go-Set-a-Watchman.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"If the goal of Go Set a Watchman was to leave me both satisfied and disappointed, it succeeded.

On one hand, I got to read a second book by Harper Lee—a sequel to <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, no less. On the other hand, I couldn’t understand why a perfect book needed this mediocre sequel. Far from living up to its predecessor‘s reputation, <em>Watchman</em> undermined much of what made <em>Mockingbird</em> a masterpiece of American fiction.</p>\n<p><em>Watchman</em> reintroduces many familiar characters from the previous novel, and many of them haven’t aged gracefully. Now 72 years old, Atticus Finch has devolved from a symbolic civils right sympathizer into an arthritic senior whose stance on racial equality has deteriorated alongside his body. Where once stood an undisputed hero of the American justice system now sits a crippled conservative overwhelmed by the growing momentum of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>\n<p>The Atticus that you knew in high school is long gone. Midway through the novel, Papa Finch upsets Scout by attending by attending a Citizens’ Council Meeting, which is essentially a bigots soapbox meeting. In a subsequent conversation between Scout and Atticus, our former civil rights advocate refers to black men as incompetent children—a far cry from the hero who defended the innocent Tom Robinson in a hopeless case two decades prior.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, Atticus’s daughter has grown up to be a calm and contemplative woman, though she remains the same mischievous girl in spirit. Even though Jean Louise Finch has outgrown her childhood nickname, I’m still going to call her Scout. Unlike in <em>Mockingbird</em>, Scout doesn’t narrate <em>Watchman</em>, instead acting as the main character of a third person story. The resulting style is comparatively detached and cool, as if to mirror Scout’s discomfort with the formality of adulthood.</p>\n<p>One of the saving graces of <em>Watchman</em> is its humor. The funny moments are the ones that best resonate with its predecessor’s charm and bring the characters to life. One of my favorite scenes involves Scout being (falsely) accused of skinny dipping at night, to which Atticus replies, “I hope you weren’t doing the backstroke.” Scout’s eccentric Uncle Jack, who was largely pushed into the background of Mockingbird, also gets more time in the spotlight. Uncle Jack helps Scout reach an understanding of her father, offering wisdom and wit peppered with obscure references to Victorian poetry.</p>\n<p>Other fun moments were the flashbacks interspersed throughout <em>Watchman</em> to expand on the childhood-centered plot of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Scout’s recollections show how a brash and tomboyish girl matured into a sensible young woman. Unfortunately, these touching scenes always seemed to occur totally separate from the main story, in a way that distracted from the more pressing issues of Scout’s evolving relationship with her father. As much as I enjoyed the glimpses of nostalgia, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were forced into this sequel.</p>\n<p>In fact, if I had to sum up <em>Watchman</em> in one word, it would be “forced.” The lesson at its end is ambiguous, just like Atticus himself. The conclusion amounts to Scout destroying her long-cherished vision of her father so that she can begin to regard him as a normal man. In other words, Atticus succeeds in disillusioning both his daughter and the audience. It’s an inadequate resolution one would expect from the work of an inexperienced writer.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <em>Watchman</em> is the work of an inexperienced writer. Supposedly it is the recently “rediscovered” story that Harper Lee devised <em>before</em> reworking it into her great American novel. As the author is now almost 90, and never intended to publish another book, I side with the not unpopular opinion that <em>Watchman</em> should have stayed lost. It has its moments—it’s still Harper Lee, after all—but it’s best read as a study of the writer’s stylistic growth, or even as a rough draft.  If you’ve picked it up expecting a good story, prepare to be let down. Just hope you can handle reality better than Scout did.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/","id":6950,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6949,6948,6947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Therapy Becomes Art: “Marwencol” Kicks off The Humanities and the Brain Series","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marwencoldn111116.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marwencoldn111116.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nestled just around the corner of Beauville, France lies a town laden with rusty military tanks, chipped-paint buildings and dusty roads.

Men in camouflage garb bustle about, tending to wounded comrades and toasting to victories. Women dressed in bright pastels stage cat fights, ambush SS soldiers and operate time machines.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the World War II town of Marwencol is no ordinary community. In fact, it exists in two different spaces: in the physical realm as a backyard 1:6 scale model project and in Mark Hogancamp’s mind as a therapeutic endeavor.</p>\n<p>“Marwencol,” directed by Jeff Malmberg (making his documentary feature debut), follows Hogancamp as he creates his fictional town in an attempt to recover from a beating outside a Kingston, NY bar in April 2000. The attack left Hogancamp suspended in a nine-day coma. He awoke with lost memories and the inability to walk, eat, read or write. When his state-sponsored rehabilitation expired, he took matters into his own hands and began building Marwencol. Doll alter egos of his friends, family, attackers and himself populate the town, serving as bar tenders, soldiers, enemies and love interests in epic battles and re-enacted memories. Staging and photographing these dramas allowed Hogancamp to slowly recover his hand-eye coordination and provided an outlet for his frustration.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But little did he know Marwencol would soon break from his private bubble and storm the world stage. After its discovery by arts and culture magazine <em>Esopus </em>and an exhibition at a New York art gallery (and now an award-winning documentary), Hogancamp finds himself in conflict between the safety of his fantasy town and the real world he’s tried so hard to escape from.</p>\n<p>One of the victories this film achieves is in its mise-en-scene, thanks to Hogancamp’s sharp eye for detail. Briefcases clasped in the hands of 1:6 scale dolls carry guns with fake, removable magazines and certificates of ownership, handwritten in tiny yet legible cursive. Expert manipulation of hands and feet breathe realistic emotion in his dolls whether engaged in battle or romantic entanglements. Hogancamp even creates doll alter egos for his doll alter ego to play with, although he can only do so much (drawing eyeliner on a 1:36 scale figure rarely awards “on fleek” results).</p>\n<p>Rarely do the subject and filmmaker play so well together in a documentary, which is why Malmberg also deserves credit for his portrayal of Hogancamp. His success comes from keeping Hogancamp at the film’s focus: using Marwencol to frame the story of a man fashioning a fantasy to rebuild a reality.</p>\n<p>“Marwencol” is the first in the “Focus On: The Humanities and the Brain” series of screenings sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) and the Carsey-Wolf Center. After the film concluded, IHC director Susan Derwin sat down with Malmberg to discuss what Marwencol (and ultimately, art) can represent.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons Marwencol was powerful for [Hogancamp] was because it wasn’t just creating child’s play,” said Malmberg. “Or maybe that’s what child’s play is; it’s the creation of emotion.”</p>\n<p>As he filmed, Malmberg found himself examining the relationship between Hogancamp and himself. He recalls learning to ready the camera early to capture his friend’s uncontained excitement, intimate discussions of art and photography and a personal promise to present the character of Hogancamp as he is. In exploring this unique journey to rehabilitation, Malmberg raises important questions regarding the labels of “art” and “artist” for Hogancamp as a creator, Malmberg as a filmmaker and audience members as spectators.</p>\n<p>“We’re all trying to look inside this private world and he’s been kind enough to show us,” said Malmberg. “There’s responsibility there as an audience member and as a filmmaker to honor that experience.”</p>\n<p>Marwencol continues to grow today. Scenes constantly shift from playing major roles in the main narrative to being cast away as mere dream sequences. New buildings and vehicles (bomber planes, speedboats) boost the capabilities of Marwencol’s characters. Side stories take root, old ones replay, yet all have room for expansion. Call it child’s play, call it art, it’s evident Hogancamp always has something to (re)build.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66380\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66380\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/","id":6951,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6950,6949,6948],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Robert T.

Johnson’s senior composition recital. When I was handed bubble wrap and a program with “RECESS” instead of “intermission” written in chalkboard-y font, I knew I was in for a blast. I sat with first-year theater major Jeremy Scharf and first-year CCS music composition major Kelten Hemingway, both of whom were familiar with Johnson’s work.</p>\n<p>“[Robert] played bass in the musical ‘Even Greater Britain’ and he’s just a very friendly guy … he’s multifaceted as multifaceted can be. He’s crazy accomplished in that he’s directed a lot of local theater and high school musical theater productions. He rearranged the scores for high school musical productions; he did ‘The Mystery of Edwin Drood’ at Santa Barbara High School. I saw that three weekends ago and it was absurdly good!” Scharf said.</p>\n<p>Johnson displayed his skills in piano, bass and conducting, and although a fourth talent wasn’t featured, Hemingway assured me that Johnson is also highly accomplished at what he’s dubbed “composer singing: in tune, but lazy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Johnson opened his recital with a lovely piano solo entitled, “lyrics not included.” With a beat as steady as an anchor, a high-energy chase from note-to-note took place in the melody of the song. I was captivated until the final measure, and briefly took a glance at my program during the applause — to find that “RECESS” was barely the tip of the witty iceberg which was the paper in my lap. His solo was titled “lyrics not included” and was followed by the tagline “re-experience the joy of opening a present to find that batteries are sold separately.” Lacking in the tech-savvy department, batteries never cease to amaze me; however, I daresay none were needed to make this exactly what I want for Christmas. Almost immediately after I figured out I wasn’t holding just any average program, it was time to focus on the stage again.</p>\n<p>Johnson was joined by soprano Molly Clementz, cellist Kathryn Carlson and Nick Diamantides who performed with “pieces of metal that get hit” to show his composition named “unfurled.” Johnson took the role of conductor for this operatic piece, which was punctuated by more rests of complete silence than any traditional opera. The silences contrasted with, and emphasized, every powerful note, while my mind’s eye added the appropriate blanket of dry ice creeping onto the stage.</p>\n<p>After one more piece in which Johnson performed on the bass, he spent the rest of the night at the piano, which he managed to refer to in seven unique ways, my favorite three of which were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“88-keyed furniture”</li>\n<li>“instrument sized and priced like a car, but with only three wheels”</li>\n<li>“largest wooden box” (in comparison to violins’ “strings on elaborate wooden box with acoustic properties” and a cello “strings on larger wooden box”).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When recess came, I was eating chocolate chip cookies and sandwich wraps with Allison Wright, who told me more about this snazzy individual performing onstage: “My favorite]] part [of the show] is the fact that Robert came out with an iced coffee, it had two Splendas in it and a pump of half-and-half. [I know] because I know him.” In all seriousness, Wright particularly enjoyed Johnson’s composition “lament,” performed by Johnson on the piano and Carlson on the cello. “It’s a lament in the broadest sense of the term.”</p>\n<p>After recess, the music took a definite turn for the jazzy: the final two pieces incorporated electric instruments. Johnson’s composition “charles mingus was quite verbose when it came to titles: a contrafact” appeared to have been the most complex piece of the night, incorporating 10 musicians and nine different instruments, one of which was a “six-stringed axe” played by guitarist Jake Goldman. What began as an alluring trumpet solo morphed seamlessly into a mellow jam-out; I had quite some difficulty restraining myself from dancing with the music my seat.</p>\n<p>The final piece of the night was titled “forget the herring (take the sardines),” designed to remind Johnson’s audience that “canned sardines are easily portable and are rich in vitamins and minerals.” On that healthy note, and accompanied by Miller Wrenn on “slappa’ da bass” and Shane Sato on an “assortment of cylinders and circles,” Johnson closed his recital with reverberating music I could feel quite intensely in my chest. When the music faded, enthusiastic popping of bubble wrap ensued. It took much encouragement from his fellow musicians and his high-energy audience before Johnson finally took a modest, awkward bow, which only elicited wilder cheering and the popping of whatever bubble wrap had survived the show.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/robert-t-johnson-senior-recital/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/robert-t-johnson-senior-recital/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/robert-t-johnson-senior-recital/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/robert-t-johnson-senior-recital/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/robert-t-johnson-senior-recital/","id":6952,"author":{"id":742,"name":"Sammy Gerraty"},"related":[6951,6950,6949],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
