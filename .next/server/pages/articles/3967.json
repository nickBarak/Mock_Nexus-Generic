Taxpayers from each zone provide the funding, which the governments then distribute to libraries in the county. While the amount of funding remains unchanged after the vote, Isla Vista will now provide a larger percentage of the funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. government leaders support the rezoning and believe it could be a step toward a “bookmobile” and a small, permanent library in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County currently gives the library $7.80 of per-capita funding from each resident of unincorporated areas. Since I.V. is an unincorporated area, its residents generate approximately $180,000 of per-capita funding annually.</p>\n<p>The new zone will include Isla Vista, Buellton, Solvang, Eastern Goleta Valley, Community Service Area 3 and Hope Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Library currently belongs to Zone 1, which is run by the City of Santa Barbara and encompasses Eastside Library, Goleta, Montecito, Carpinteria, Buellton and Solvang.</p>\n<p>Gina Fischer, district representative for Supervisor Joan Hartmann, said she is hopeful the board’s vote will better help the City of Goleta serve I.V. residents — including students, children and families. Hartmann, who represents I.V. as Third County Supervisor, voted in favor of the rezoning at the Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>Currently, any resident of Santa Barbara County can obtain a free library card at any branch as part of a “cooperative network,” a resource Fischer said many students are unaware of.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand expressed his support for the rezoning during the board of supervisors’ April 3 meeting. The CSD directors are hopeful that Zone 4’s creation will benefit the residents of Isla Vista, as they will now have a larger stake in the services by paying for more of the funding.</p>\n<p>The CSD and the City of Goleta have proposed the creation of a “bookmobile” that would travel from the Camino Real Marketplace through I.V. They also spoke about the eventual installment of a small, permanent library.</p>\n<p>Director Spencer Brandt spoke optimistically about these ideas, calling them “a step in the right direction” toward providing I.V. residents the services they deserve considering the funds they would provide.</p>\n<p>Brandt added that there is not much leverage over how the county’s money is spent and hopes the rezoning will open doors.</p>\n<p>“We need to work towards library services that are based full-time out of Isla Vista and are tailored to our unique community needs,” he said.</p>\n<p>CSD director and county appointee Bob Geis also spoke of the lack of library services in the community, as well as the difficulty of accessing the Goleta Library for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>For residents to reach the library, which is fairly inaccessible by public transportation, it would require walking past Fairview, across the freeway overpass, from the nearest bus stop.</p>\n<p>Both Brandt and Geis are hopeful that bringing library services closer to I.V. will take place in the future, as it is a stepping stone in ensuring the funds allocated maximize services for residents.</p>\n<p>“I’m very supportive of the effort to move towards mobile library services, and think it is the first step towards even bigger and better things, and towards a funding allocation model that makes sure the money generated in Isla Vista is being spent on services in Isla Vista,” Brandt said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Senate is aiming to create a more organized process for filling vacancies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students (A.S.) Senate discussed the resignations and appointments of four members at Wednesday’s meeting and how the vacancies will call for the creation of a permanent system of reappointments.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Senate experienced numerous vacancies, but still does not have a clear system devised to replace the senators’ positions. The past unorganized process resulted in conflict as the inconsistency prolonged the senator appointments. Bryan Velasquez’s resignation reminds the association of the importance of a clear procedure when appointing new senators.</p>\n<p>Velasquez, a second-year music major, resigned from his position as an on-campus senator during the 10th week of Fall Quarter, and Senate now must fulfill the position. According to Velasquez, his resignation was prompted by “personal reasons,” and he enjoyed working with Senate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of things happened towards the end of the quarter, and I thought it was best to take some time to figure things out,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>He said he would consider running for Senate again in the future, but “[doesn’t] see that happening any time soon.”</p>\n<p>“I would definitely be interested [in joining Senate again],” he said. “They’re all amazing people, and we all work really well together.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year economics major Ashley Selki will organize an ad-hoc committee where current senators will create a process to appoint a new senator to fill Velasquez’s vacancy. The position will then be opened for students to run, and the Senate has five weeks to appoint a new senator.</p>\n<p>EVPLA and fourth-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar encouraged the senators to take their time devising a permanent system as he recalled the vacancies the Senate experienced during his own term last year.</p>\n<p>“I very much encourage you to take your time … make a system, make it good, make it work,” Minoiefar said. “It can affect the whole association.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar warned the Senate against arguing with each other and beginning the appointment process before a proper system is created. He said this would lead to more problems during this appointment and in future cases.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think you’re right, you all need to talk about it in here,” he said. “If you’re not happy with the process before you start, it is going to get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also opened the first meeting of the quarter with the swearing in of second-year political science and communication double major Izabella Kipnis as a new off-campus senator. Kipnis had previously worked with the Senate in the Honoraria Committee, a position that will now be filled by third-year political science major Jordan Goulet.</p>\n<p>Kipnis is currently working on transitioning into the Senate and is beginning to focus on working with I.V. Tenants Union in regards to the rising amount of evictions in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Senator Jasmine Sandhu, third-year biopsychology and sociology double major, was also appointed as the new vice chair of the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/","id":3966,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3965,3964,3963],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
