Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were dispatched to a sorority house to investigate an audible alarm. Deputies arrived on scene and found a suspect, later identified as Brian Lopez Aranda, attempting to break in through the living room window. Lopez removed the window screen and triggered the alarm before deputies detained him. Aranda confessed to breaking into the residence because he was “lonely and curious about women.” Deputies arrested him for attempted residential burglary.</p>\n<p>Lopez waived his Miranda rights and informed deputies he entered the sorority house to try and see women. When asked what he would have done if he encountered a female in the residence, Lopez confessed he would have tried to touch her face. IVFP deputies added lewd and dissolute conduct in a public place to the burglary charges, and booked Lopez into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>The streets of I.V. remained quiet Saturday night.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, IVFP deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers responded to a report of a robbery at the 800 block of Camino del Sur. The suspects were described as a black adult male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a shorter, white adult male. The victim was hit in the head by one of the two suspects who both fled the area. The case is currently under investigation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/weekend-wrapup-may-21-25/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/weekend-wrapup-may-21-25/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/weekend-wrapup-may-21-25/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/weekend-wrapup-may-21-25/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/weekend-wrapup-may-21-25/","id":3938,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3937,3936,3935],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian","biography":"Not available","articles":[2931,2947,2960,3459,3760,3773,3778,3779,3780,3781,3782,3784,3936,3937,3938,3940,3941,3942,4622,4747,4772,4783,4790,4796],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Proposed Calif.

The more it makes us money, the less we rely on foreign oil,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fergus explained that allowing offshore drilling would be an enormous step backward in efforts to convert UCSB into an environmentally friendly campus.</p>\n<p>California’s exemption from the DPP would have positive political implications by forcing transportation and energy industries to turn to alternative, more sustainable resources such as wind and solar energy, Fergus said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major and vice chair of UCSB’s Coastal Fund, said that increased oil development makes clean energy seem like a better alternative.</p>\n<p>“I think that by not relying on such harmful forms of energy both in extraction and use, we incentivize the innovation that we need,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG recently released an email petition for campus community members to sign in opposition of offshore oil drilling. The group’s goal is to make the UCSB campus run on 100 percent renewable energy, according to Fergus.</p>\n<p>“There’s no safe way to drill for oil and transport oil,” said Liam Horstick, campus organizer of UCSB CALPIRG. “We shouldn’t be drilling for more fossil fuels, anyway, because of the impact to climate change and 100 percent renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor and Santa Barbara County representative, is currently working on several projects to push the county toward more sustainable sources of energy.</p>\n<p>According to an email statement from Hartmann, such projects include “evaluating Community Choice Energy, increasing buildout local distributed energy resources such as solar, demanding response and energy storage to create a more resilient energy system and promoting zero emission vehicles and infrastructure for these vehicles that don’t have internal combustion engines.”</p>\n<p>The Dos Cuadros oil field holds about 11.4 million accessible barrels of crude oil under the Santa Barbara Channel and is part of what attracts oil companies to California’s Central Coast. The federally leased field is regulated by the DOI, not the state of California.</p>\n<p>In early 1969, a well blowout about 10 miles from Santa Barbara’s coast in the Dos Cuadras field caused the spill of roughly 100,000 barrels of crude oil into the Santa Barbara Channel, polluting beaches from Goleta to Ventura and on four of the Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>Over 3,600 sea birds died, along with fish, barnacles and some marine mammals. The spill resulted in $9.5 million of commercial and private property damage.</p>\n<p>The platform that caused the spill is currently still in operation today, along with its three sibling platforms.</p>\n<p>The effects of the spill contributed to the passage of several environmental protection acts as well as the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the California Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>A major spill occurred again in 2015, when a Plains All American pipeline burst, sending 3,400 barrels of crude oil into the waters of Refugio State Beach. The pipeline has now been closed.</p>\n<p>The 1969 and 2015 oil spills have served as points of reference for many opponents of the DOI’s movement to open coastal waters to drilling.</p>\n<p>“The Central Coast knows all too well the risks that oil drilling poses to our communities, and I will continue to urge this Administration to take our coastline off the negotiating table,” Carbajal said in his statement.</p>\n<p>Since 1969, the California States Lands Commission has not granted any new offshore drilling leases within its jurisdiction limit of three miles off the coast, though existing operations were allowed to continue.</p>\n<p>The DOI temporarily paused operations on California’s Outer Continental Shelf following the 1969 spill until the passages of the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in 1970.</p>\n<p>Another major component of the opposition to the proposal is California’s economy. According to Hartmann, coastal recreational, fishing and tourism are essential to the state’s thriving economy and the proposed program could be extremely detrimental to such industries.</p>\n<p>Like California, coastal states across the country rose in opposition against the BOEM’s proposed plan. Governors in Washington and Oregon joined Brown to sign a joint statement in early January saying that the states would take any measure to prevent oil drilling.</p>\n<p>“They’ve chosen to forget the utter devastation of past offshore oil spills … They’ve chosen to ignore the science that tells us our climate is changing and we must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. But we won’t forget history or ignore science,” the statement read.</p>\n<p>The BOEM is currently holding public meetings across the country regarding each coastal state’s stance on drilling.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/","id":3935,"author":{"id":242,"name":"Anyi Cheng"},"related":[3934,3933,3932],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up 5/7-5/10","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sbso_masthead_office_new_012.jpg?resize=355%2C192&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sbso_masthead_office_new_012.jpg?resize=769%2C192&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to one case of public intoxication, one break-in, two fights, one peeping tom and one vehicle theft last weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to one case of public intoxication, one break-in, two fights, one peeping tom and one vehicle theft last weekend.</p>\n<p>Thursday night, a 7-Eleven employee reported a subject urinating in an aisle. Upon entering the store IVFP deputies saw the subject, later identified as 19-year-old UCSB student Peter Alan Deleon, mopping the floor. After questioning Deleon, deputies arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Friday night, deputies responded to a break-in on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. Residents who witnessed the break-in said the suspect, identified as Atascadero resident Zachary Devries, jumped onto a car, then fell to the ground near the residency and became violent when asked if he was okay. He punched two subjects and proceeded to break into the residency by shattering a glass door. Residents then beat Devries in self-defense until he became unconscious. He was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Friday night deputies also responded to a report of a fight in front of Aladdin Café at 938 Embarcadero Del Norte. Witnesses said a subject, identified as 19-year-old Goleta resident Santiago Carmona, punched an employee of the restaurant. The employee, who stated Carmona hit him in the jaw, requested prosecution and signed a citizen’s arrest form. Carmona was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive noticed a male adult looking in windows of an apartment complex at 6653. After speaking with the subject, later identified as Carnell Lewis, deputies found he had no connection to the building. Lewis threatened the deputies and refused to comply with their instructions. He was then arrested on numerous charges and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday night, deputies responded to a report of a fight on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. Deputies arrived and found approximately 40 people shouting obscenities at each other. Two subjects, identified as Jefferson Crockett and Campbell Davis, were arrested for breaking a victim’s jaw.</p>\n<p>Sunday, deputies responded to a report of a vehicle theft on the intersection of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.

The car was in drive and running on Embarcadero Road headed towards Del Playa Road. Officers administered a DUI investigation and found the driver had a BAC of .01 percent, with a background check later revealing Jordan as a heroin addict. Jordan admitted to being under the influence of heroin, later confirmed through a urine sample. Deputies also located heroin paraphernalia in his vehicle. Jordan was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail and his vehicle was towed and stored with Loves Towing.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 6, two I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were walking near Anisq’ Oyo’ Park and recognized Say’Qwaun Ford, a suspect whom they had seen in recent warrant status. He was detained for a records check and with Ford’s consent, deputies searched his backpack. A small pouch of marijuana, a small amount of cocaine and a stolen wallet with multiple items belonging to different people were found. Ford said he found the wallet on the kitchen floor of a party he attended the night before and did not know how the cocaine ended up in his bag, but anticipated his fingerprints would most likely be on it. He admitted to owning the marijuana. Ford, who had a previous history of providing a false identity and burglary, was arrested for theft and possession of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>On the night of Friday, Oct. 9, at approximately 12:46 a.m., law enforcement officers attempted to stop and detain a male suspect on suspicion of an alcohol possession violation. The suspect fled from the officers, drawing attention from other law enforcement officials in the area who ran to assist. One of the assisting officers collided with the suspect, causing him to slam into a parked car and slide to the pavement. Deputies then converged on the suspect as medical assistance made its way to the scene. Upon arrival, paramedics treated the suspect then took him to the hospital for further evaluation. The suspect fractured his left wrist and had several abrasions on his head, hands and knees. UCPD initiated a Use of Force review as a UCPD officer made contact with the suspect.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, an IVFP deputy witnessed a suspect, later identified as Dustin Anthony, strike a male victim in the head with a closed fist in the middle of Del Playa Road. The victim lost consciousness and hit his head on the concrete, causing him to seize and urinate in his pants.
