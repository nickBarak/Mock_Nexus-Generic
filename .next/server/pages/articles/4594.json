As the night continued, attendees shared their personal experiences from the stage via poetry, spoken word and rap.<br>\nTran said the open mic list was the most important thing making its way through the crowd.<br>\n“I know it’s one of the most intimidating things to get up on stage and share work in front of strangers that you never met before … but for me I hope these words are the purest form of liberation,” Tran said.<br>\nThird-year political science major Marquel Carnell said performing made him introspective.<br>\n“It made me think about love and freedom, oppression, my heritage,” Carnell said. “It made me think about a lot of things and that’s what’s so cool about these open mics.”<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Lannhu Khuat said the event was her first time in the Biko House and the crowd was very supportive of different backgrounds.<br>\n“It was just amazing to be a part of an environment that welcomed so much diversity,” Khuat said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66397\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1149883661\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66412\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66397\" data-attachment-id=\"66397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/biko-house-hosts-open-mic-night-with-mc-fong-tran/expression_by-stephen-manga-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447141463\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Expression_by Stephen Manga-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-66397\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year art history major Abraham Lizama said open mic events are places where people can share positivity, adding that he has been attending open mics for years.<br>\n“It’s powerful in the sense that when a person shared, you felt what they felt,” Lizama said. “You can see everything that they were saying and that’s why I love coming to these events because it’s an experience that you don’t get elsewhere.”<br>\nTran said educating people on issues affecting minority students is an important part of creating a welcoming environment.<br>\n“You have to be conscious about the issues happening in society and recognize them … such as racism and forms of oppression,” Tran said.<br>\nTran said it can be easier to sing or rap about societal issues rather than discussing them.<br>\n“There’s ways to be true to those struggles but at the same time celebrate and heal,” Tran said. “We had a packed house, we had a super diverse community that came on, the energy was high and I couldn’t imagine a better event … It was really impressive that people seek these spaces.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Assistant Professor of Black Studies at UCSB Mia White said America’s educational system is problematic.</p>\n<p>“We have a real lack of moral, ethical and analytical ability,” White said. “Many of our students in our elementary schools are taught with rose-colored glasses and dumbed down . . . they don’t understand the real history of the United States.”</p>\n<p>White said it is important for faculty to show support for student movements.</p>\n<p>“This is many students’ first foray into resistance and I need to support that,” White said. “It’s about having an ethical conversation around resisting anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>Multiple attendees, including BSU member and first-year psychology major Lauryn Westbrook, voiced concern with a common phrase used against the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>“When you say ‘all lives matter,’ you can say that, and yes that’s true, but it’s the fact that my black body is threatened just because it’s black,” Westbrook said. “All lives are not being targeted — colored people’s lives are being targeted.”</p>\n<p>As members of the church began to clean up Woodstock’s Pizza boxes, Cox explained the importance of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_587657522\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Tuesday’s</span></span> dinner outside the church, pausing to shake the hand of a fourth-year UCSB student he had just met.</p>\n<p>“That’s what it’s about,” Cox said. “It’s about making a one-on-one connection, because if you make a one-on-one connection, suddenly the other person isn’t the other, it’s Randy, Melissa, Kayla.”</p>\n<p>Third-year art history major Abraham Lizama said there is a disconnect between Isla Vista’s perceived diversity and its actual representation of students of color.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of this community for my entire life, I’ve seen a lot change,” Lizama said. “How democratic, liberal and diverse this community claims to be, it’s just a façade. <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_587657523\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Tonight</span></span>, go back home, see the community as it is, not as you think it is.”</p><div
