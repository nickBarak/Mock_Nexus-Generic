Mazza has pitched 9.2 innings this season, and maintains a .93 earned run average. This will be Mazza’s third start for the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>In his last start against Pepperdine, Mazza pitched for four innings and allowed four runs in six hits — one of which was a homerun. Four other pitchers appeared in that same game including junior righty reliever James Carter for his third save of four total this season. Carter currently leads the Big West in saves.</p>\n<p>“Our bullpen is going to be a big part of [our success],” Checketts said. “Domenic is going to have to come out and throw more strikes than he did in his last outing.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior right fielder Luke Swenson has been heating up at the plate in the last week with at least one hit per game in the series against Oregon and two in Sunday’s win. Swenson goes into today’s game with a .349 batting average.</p>\n<p>In addition, junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic ranks third in the Big West’s leading batting averages as he hits for .432. Nesovic also has 11 RBIs and is tied for first in total conference RBIs. So far this season, the Gauchos are hitting for a collective .282 batting average and have scored 61 total runs in their 11 games. The Gauchos currently top the Big West in overall batting average.</p>\n<p>“I think that we’re waiting for our offense to come together a little bit more. We struggled a lot offensively this weekend, and our pitching definitely won the game for us on Sunday,” junior first baseman Dalton Kelly said. “We’re just waiting for our offense to start clicking again like it was the first couple weekends.”</p>\n<p>Leading the USC offense is senior catcher Garrett Stubbs who is batting for a .489 average with a .547 on-base percentage as he has drawn five bases on balls from opposing pitchers.</p>\n<p>A power hitter for the Trojans is junior outfielder David Oppenheim, who is currently putting up a .640 slugging percentage with a single home run and four doubles this season. Collectively, the Trojans are batting for a .318 average.</p>\n<p>“I think that on Friday and Saturday we learned a lot about ourselves as a team,” Kelly said. “But on Sunday we played pretty clean baseball; we played for each other and that translated into a ‘W.’ I think [today] should be a reflection of Sunday.”</p>\n<p>This will be the first time since the 2012 season that the two teams have faced, where in both games the Gauchos recorded victories both on the road and at home.</p>\n<p>The game today is at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium in a single-match appearance. This will be the last home game before the Gauchos pack up for two consecutive weekends on the road against Sacramento, followed by Wichita State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61523\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/gauchos-set-to-host-pac-12-leading-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61523\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/gauchos-set-to-host-pac-12-leading-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/gauchos-set-to-host-pac-12-leading-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/gauchos-set-to-host-pac-12-leading-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/gauchos-set-to-host-pac-12-leading-usc/","id":4401,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4400,4399,4398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Santa Barbara Earns Series Finale Win Over Oregon","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_1742-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_1742-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Justin Jacome's performance on the mound Sunday gave UCSB its only win of a three-game series against the Ducks.

With another allowed walk to load the bases, Jacome got out of the inning after junior first baseman Brandon Cuddy flied out with a line drive to senior left fielder Cameron Newell.</p>\n<p>“[Checketts] told me that this was my guy, and unfortunately though I walked him, I was doing the best I could,” Jacome said. “I wanted the next guy even more, and that out was a huge out for us.”</p>\n<p>Jacome’s win marked a bounce-back game from his loss against Kentucky last weekend. In his 8.1 innings pitched against the Ducks, he recorded his second win of the season with 10 strikeouts. Being passed the baton in the ninth, junior righty reliever James Carter came in for his fourth save. Carter maintains a 0.00 ERA through 7.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“I needed this confidence booster,” Jacome said. “Everything was working for me — my sliders and my change ups. I’m not big on striking out guys, I usually try to get the pop-ups and ground balls, but I was getting the strikeouts [Sunday].”</p>\n<p>Newell preformed at the plate on Sunday, scoring the only run of the game with his second homer of the season to deep right field off of the Duck’s starting pitcher, senior right-hander Jack Karraker. Karraker pitched through six and allowed three hits to the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I got a really good swing off,” Newell said. “Thing’s weren’t really going great for us this weekend and I didn’t think one run was going to separate this game, but Jacome did an outstanding job and was the reason we won the game.”</p>\n<p>Though the series ended in a Gaucho win, the Ducks posed as a strong competitor taking two games and the advantage in the series. In his start on Saturday, sophomore righty Shane Bieber fell victim to Oregon’s offensive strength as the Ducks dominated 11-3.</p>\n<p>“Even though Bieber got beat up [on Saturday], I still think he executed fine. He had a couple weird innings, but he gave us a chance,” Checketts said. “We’ve still got the ‘seventh and eighth inning’ issue where we still don’t really know what we’re going to do.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, five Ducks recorded RBIs and Cuddy racked up seven of a total 11 team RBIs with a triple and a home run. The Duck’s starter freshman lefty David Peterson pitched through six innings and allowed only four hits to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This is a gut-check series for us, losing the first two and coming back [Sunday],” Newell said. “It showed how tough we are, and our ability to bounce back forward for the rest of the season.”</p>\n<p>Junior righty Dillon Tate took the mound in the series-opening 5-1 Oregon win, and recorded his first loss of the season. Tate shutout Oregon through five innings, allowed one run in the sixth and two in the seventh. He ends the weekend with a 1.29 season ERA.</p>\n<p>“[Tate] was outstanding,” Checketts said. “He looked like a bonafide All-American starter.”</p>\n<p>Tate’s solid start was not enough to secure a Gaucho win, as freshman shortstop Clay Fisher was the Gauchos’ only run in Friday’s game, and was driven in by sophomore leadoff hitter and center fielder Andrew Calica. Oregon’s Friday pitchers held the UCSB offense to only five hits.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we’ve got to go to work, our team batting average probably dropped over fifty points this weekend and we have to be able to have better at-bats against quality pitching,” Checketts said. “We have to even up our strokes. We’ve gotten too many backwards ‘K’s,’ where we haven’t been swinging with two strikes. That’s just one of the learning experiences.”</p>\n<p>The team will host the Pac 12 league leader, and undefeated USC as the Trojans travels to Santa Barbara for a one-game appearance at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Tuesday at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/","id":4398,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4397,4396,4395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels North to Play Three-Game Series at Sac State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Baseball_StephenManga_for03042015-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Baseball_StephenManga_for03042015-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Coming off an upset win over USC, the Gauchos await Sacramento State for a three-game stand.

Tate and Bieber have both thrown for 21 innings and Jacome through 18.2. Tate still holds the lowest earned run average among the UCSB starters with a cumulative 1.29 E.R.A. Tate is also tied for third in the conference in total strikeouts with 25.</p>\n<p>“We’re focusing on every day as a new day,” Nesovic said. “We’re not going to worry about the weekend until it’s here.”</p>\n<p>The team will take with it a lineup that is hitting for a collective .279 batting average and a .372 on-base percentage. Nesovic continues to lead the Gaucho offense charge with a .463 batting average. Nesovic is currently topping the Big West in overall batting average.</p>\n<p>Senior outfielder Luke Swenson follows right behind, batting .400 and has recorded one triple and two doubles in his 14 total hits. Swenson has only struck out four times this season.</p>\n<p>“We need to execute, throw strikes under pressure and in tough situations,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to be able to execute small ball.”</p>\n<p>Lead-off hitter, RS sophomore outfielder Andrew Calica leads the team in on-base percentage with a .554 average. He is also leading the team in drawing walks off opposing pitchers with 10 bases on balls.</p>\n<p>“We’re still working offensively I think, I’m feeling confident defensively, but offensively we’ve still got some work to do,” Checketts said. “We’re practicing today and tomorrow and there are a lot of things we need to work on like tightening our swings.”</p>\n<p>The Sacramento offense is hitting for a .282 collective batting average and is 6-2 at home this season.
