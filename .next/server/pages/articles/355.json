The Mustangs enter with an identical record of 6-8, 0-1, also having lost at Hawai’i last week.</p>\n<p>“We just need to have the same mindset we had during that four-game winning streak. We were focused and playing together and we worked on a couple different things in practice to be more cohesive,” sophomore forward Alex Hart said. “With Cal Poly it’s a rivalry, so I think that’s been fueling the guys in practice this week to take care of that.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB went undefeated in its three games against Cal Poly, including a 54-50 win in the Big West Tournament Quarterfinals. However, none of those wins came in particularly convincing fashion, as the Gauchos managed only a 5.67 average margin of victory, with current leading scorer in senior guard Michael Bryson averaged just eight points in each of those games.</p>\n<p>That average will likely be surpassed tonight, as Bryson has shined as UCSB’s top offensive option so far this season. The 6’4″ guard leads the Big West in scoring at 19.5 points per game, shooting at a highly efficient clip of 47.3 percent from the field, third-best among guards.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Cal Poly is senior guard David Nwaba, who averages team-highs in points (11.5 ppg), rebounds (5.8 rpg), assists (4.5 apg) and steals (1.64 spg).</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the season for UCSB, reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent has found his shot in recent games, going 15-31 on three-pointers in his last five outings. The sophomore guard backs up Bryson as the team’s second-leading scorer, putting in 12.6 ppg. Vincent ranks fifth in the conference at 2.3 three-point makes per game, hitting 40 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is virtually tied with Cal Poly for sixth in shooting percentage at just under 44 percent, but the Mustangs average the second most points in the conference at 75.4 a game. That mark can be attributed to their taking good care of the ball, averaging a conference-best 10.5 TO per game, as well as their 37.9 percent shooting from deep, which ranks second. On the other side, the Gauchos average just 70.4 ppg and convert 33.7 percent of their threes, both good for seventh in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Further bringing down the UCSB offense is its inability to get to the free throw line. The Gauchos average just 15.2 FTA per game, putting them miles behind conference leader Cal State Fullerton’s average of 25.9.</p>\n<p>“Free throws have been a big thing all year,” Hart said. “I think we’ve been starting to catch up with the rest of the conference though, especially with our guards attacking a lot more, getting to the rim and getting contact. I think we’re on the right track.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ inability to get to the line hurt them down the stretch in their opener against Hawai’i, as they were outshot 13-2 in the second half from the charity stripe in a game that went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>“We need to work on starting the second half strong,” Hart said. “A lot of times, we come out lacking energy. If we come out strong and get off to a good start in the second half it’ll really help us finish out games.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Mustangs haven’t fared quite as well from the line, making just 2.78 more free throws per game than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, Cal Poly has struggled, allowing the most points to opponents in the conference at 75.9 per game. The Gauchos meanwhile have been solid when they don’t have possession, ranking third in opponent field goal defense (40.6%)  and second in three-point defense (31%). However, no matter if the offense has been hot or cold this season, Head Coach Bob Williams’ team has continued to emphasize defense and refused to get complacent with its effort.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep making defensive improvements,” Lakoju said. “Offense is something we can improve every day, but if we lock down defensively then our offense should be able to translate.”</p>\n<p>This will be the last of a two-game road trip for the Gauchos before they return home for three straight, starting with UC Irvine this Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal Poly are set to tip-off at 7 p.m. tonight at the Mott Athletics Center in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Cal Poly, seeking to avenge its conference-opening loss to Santa Barbara, sits at 10-17 overall and 4-10 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After suffering a home loss to Hawaii on Feb. 4, Santa Barbara has since redeemed itself with its latest winning resurgence. UCSB has beaten all of its opponents by double-figures during its six-game win streak.</p>\n<p>After starting the year with a conference record of 2-4, the Gauchos have matured from their rough start gaining some valuable momentum as they near the Big West Tournament. Coach Williams accredits the team’s solid play to its tough matches against Long Beach State and Hawaii early in its conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“We came out absolutely flat [for Hawaii and Long Beach],” Williams said. “We were humbled by [these losses] and have come out with a much greater sense of urgency.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson will certainly pose as a mismatch on offense for Riverside, gradually coming into his own during the Gauchos’ winning stretch.<br>\nBryson, who earned himself his second nomination as the Big West Player of the Week this year on Monday, propelled the Gauchos to victory last Saturday after scoring a team-high 19 points.</p>\n<p>Connecting from deep five times on Saturday, the fourth-year starter broke James Powell’s record for the most three-pointers in school history, moving to first all-time with 223. Bryson now has 1,523 career points, just 57 shy of seventh place all-time for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bryson’s recent shooting stroke will enable Williams to run spread sets on offense, keeping defenses discipline beyond the arc. The 6’4” guard is currently shooting 61 percent from three in his last two games.</p>\n<p>Bryson, who leads the conference in scoring with 18.5 points per game, has scored double-figures in 25 of 26 games this season.</p>\n<p>As for Head Coach Dennis Cutts and the Highlanders, junior forward Secean Johnson will be the go-to guy on offense. After dismissing All-Big West forward Taylor Johns from the team for undisclosed team violations, Johnson has embraced a larger role for Riverside down in the post.</p>\n<p>Now seeing an increase in minutes, the junior transfer is averaging 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in his last two games, contest in which Johns was inactive.</p>\n<p>Johns, last season’s All-Big West First Team honoree, averaged 15.5 points and 7.5 rebounds this year for UCR.</p>\n<p>For Saturday night’s game, the Gauchos must contain seniors Reese Morgan and David Nwaba. Morgan is coming off two career games, scoring 23 points against Cal State Northridge and dropping another 22 in his senior night game against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be another defensive concern for UCSB. The Santa Monica College transfer led the Mustangs in their last outing against Santa Barbara, scoring a team-high 16 points to go along with nine rebounds. Look for Bryson to be matched up with the 6’4” Nwaba as he uses his frame to slash his way to the rim.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also honor seniors Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, John Green and Michael Bryson on Saturday. Williams expects an intense crowd and rowdy atmosphere to be a central component in propelling his seniors to victory.</p>\n<p>“We hope it gets rowdy [on Saturday],” Williams said. “Our seniors deserve it — they’ve had really great careers here and it’ll be great for the student body and community to pay tribute to these kids.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game begins at 7 p.m. The Blue-Green rivalry will be reignited Saturday, March 5 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/","id":352,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[351,350,349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season-Lows in Shooting Lead to Rough Ending for Gauchos, Lose 59-45 at Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In attempt to upset Hawaii on its Senior Night, the UCSB women's basketball team fell short in its worst shooting performance of the season.

Hawaii improved to 18-10 overall, 11-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Hawaii’s shooting was senior guard/forward Destiny King going 5-6 from the field as she nearly notched a double-double with 13 points and a game-high nine rebounds. She also managed to tally three steals in the team’s Senior Night matchup while junior point guard Briana Harris led all scorers with 15 points.</p>\n<p>Although freshman guard Coco Miller registered a team-high 13 points, the rest of the Gauchos’ offense struggled as no other player finished in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded buckets to begin the game, ending the first quarter tied at 13 apiece. Combining for 12 of Santa Barbara’s 13 points in the period was Miller and senior guard Jasmine Ware with six points each. King managed to keep the Rainbow Wahine in contention with six points in the opening quarter as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it was free-throw shooting that sustained the steady swap of points between the two teams. UCSB ended the first half 7-10 at the free-throw line while Hawaii made 6-13 attempts, resulting in the Rainbow Wahine’s 26-21 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>While Hawaii managed to get to the free-throw line in the third quarter as well, complementing the Rainbow Wahine’s foul shooting was their 55.6 shooting percentage in the period. With five minutes remaining in the quarter, Hawaii embarked on a 14-2 run to end the third with a 44-31 lead.</p>\n<p>Trailing by double-figures, UCSB trimmed Hawaii’s lead to single-figures at the 2:59 mark of the final period off a pair of free-throws by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>However, restraining Santa Barbara’s comeback was its cold shooting hand as it recorded its worst field goal percentage of the game in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>In spite of going 9-10 at the free-throw line, the Gauchos shot 2-12 from the field and 1-5 from behind the three-point in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCSB’s shooting struggles, Hawaii’s second half improvements shooting the ball continued. The Rainbow Wahine concluded the final stretch of Thursday’s contest with a 54.5 field goal percentage on 6-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>In addition to recording season-lows in overall and three-point field goal percentage, the Gauchos also tied their season-low total of five assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB will await the outcome of Saturday’s game between Hawaii and Cal Poly in order to know what seeding it will earn in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a Cal Poly loss, Santa Barbara could secure the No. 5 seed. If the Mustangs were to win, they would be tied with UCSB at 8-8 in conference play. Since both teams split the pair of games they had against each other, the No. 5 seed would be rewarded to Cal Poly for having a better overall record.</p>\n<p>Currently tied for the No. 2 seed with Long Beach State, Hawaii faces a similar situation. A win over Cal Poly and a loss by the 49ers could help them to secure the seed. However, if neither team loses a game on Saurday, LBSU will be rewarded the No. 2 seed due to it possessing a greater overall record.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Tournament will begin Tuesday, March 8 at 6 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/","id":353,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[352,351,350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Upsets Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road facing Big West-leading UC Irvine, the UCSB women’s basketball team stepped up big on Thursday with an important 69-58 victory over the Anteaters.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On the road facing Big West-leading UC Irvine, the UCSB women’s basketball team stepped up big on Thursday with an important 69-58 victory over the Anteaters.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20281 align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/rgb-06jan11-womensbball-3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-31699\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rgb-06jan11-womensbball-3-250x214.jpg?resize=250%2C214\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"214\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31699\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span> With the win, the Gauchos are now 9-7 (3-1 in conference) on the season.

The bench posted its second consecutive 23-point effort.</p>\n<p>“Our game plan was to make it hard for their top two scorers tonight,” Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. “Our pressure put them out of a rhythm and they missed a lot of shots early. We executed the game plan well and competed for a full 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held Irvine forward Mikah Maly-Karros and guard Jade Smith-Williams in check throughout the game, holding the duo to 16 points, well below their combined average of 33.</p>\n<p>“It was a phenomenal defensive effort by our team,” Gottlieb said. “Mekia set the tone early and didn’t let [Maly-Karros] get anything easy. She was able to control the game from the start and the rest of the players did a great job helping on the double-team.”</p>\n<p>Irvine was held to under 33 percent shooting on the night, highlighted by Smith-Williams’ two of 10 from the field. The Gauchos shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t been hitting a lot of my shots, especially threes,” Zornig said. “But in this game, I started taking it to the basket more. It felt really good to start hitting those shots out there tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Irvine by 15 in the game. Sophomore forward Sweets Underwood continued to play well with nine points and six rebounds while filling in for senior forward Margaret Johnson, who has missed the last three games due to an injury.</p>\n<p>However, turnovers continued to be a concern for the Gauchos as they committed a season high of 27.</p>\n<p>“We need to give ourselves a chance to score, and turnovers take away those opportunities.,” Gottlieb said. “Tonight was a situation where it unraveled with the turnovers, but we were able to still win despite not taking care of the ball.”</p>\n<p>After a good night’s rest, the Gauchos will continue the road trip and prepare for another tough opponent, this time facing defending Big West champion UC Riverside. The Highlanders’ record of 9-7 (3-1 in conference) is identical to UCSB’s.</p>\n<p>“I think they are a tough team,” Zornig said. “We need to stop them defensively. We are going to get a game plan going tomorrow, and hopefully it will be effective and we can knock them off because they were Big West champs last year.”</p>\n<p>Riverside is coming off of an 85-67 victory over Long Beach State on Thursday night. Sophomore guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham leads the team with over 10 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The game plan for Riverside is totally different,” Gottlieb said. “We know they are the defending tournament champs and we need to focus on our prep and play with same the same intensity and energy as we did tonight. It’s going to be key for us to control the boards, and clean up the offense obviously, but overall continue to be a lockdown defensive team.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Riverside is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/","id":354,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[353,352,351],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
