Easton’s Instagram is where you’ll find the coach talking a bit more about everything to do with Gaucho baseball and, of course, a little bit about how social distancing has played a role in all of this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for Easton, Zach Torra hadn’t quite yet become the seventh Gaucho to be named All-American under Checketts by the time of that interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, by the way, Torra is the seventh All-American Gaucho of the Checketts era.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Announced just a few days ago, Torra was named to the 2020 Collegiate Baseball Division I All-American Third Team after simply dazzling his way to a 0.36 ERA over 25.1 innings pitched. He went on to strikeout 39 of the 83 batters he faced while holding the opposition to a measly .133 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 3-0 record on the season, Torra held opponents scoreless in three of his four starts, surrendering just a single run. Torra’s most impressive showing, perhaps, came on leap day when he struck out 12 batters over seven scoreless innings en route to a 10-0 series victory over the University of Illinois at Chicago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for the cherry on top, Torra’s 39 Ks was good enough to beat most in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other NCAA news, the organization’s council has voted to approve the addition of an extra year of eligibility for all students whose seasons were impacted by the coronavirus epidemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much can be left to be desired from the 2020 season, nothing will come. However, this is great news to hear as student athletes around the country will at least be given the opportunity to compete once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And with that, here are some highlights and notes from 2020:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB played their first game under the newly constructed lights of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Feb. 17, defeating UC Berkeley 17-7.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB had been holding an eight-game winning streak when the season was terminated.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB handed No. 1 UC Los Angeles their first loss of the season in an 8-5 home victory on March 3.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished 5-0 against Power Five schools.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished first in the Big West Conference with a 13-2 record overall.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with the fourth-highest winning percentage in the country at 86.7%.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with a No. 18 average national ranking.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s pitching staff finished with a 1.84 ERA and 5 shutouts.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB hit .237 while holding opponents to a .172 average.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB hit 10 home runs, 5 triples and 22 doubles  for 37 total extra-base hits over their 15 games.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six Gauchos played in all 15 games. Senior infielder McClain O’Connor barely eclipses fellow infielder and junior Marcos Castanon for most at-bats, while the latter barely eclipses the former for most hits on the team.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Christian Kirtley led all Gauchos with 6 doubles while O’Connor’s 2 triples outpace Castanon as well as sophomores Kyle Johnson and Mason Marquez, who are all tied at 1.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Castanon hit 4 bombs for the team lead in home runs while also driving in the most batters with 17 RBIs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a dogfight for walks with Cole Cummings, Johnson and Kirtley all taking the slow way down to first base 9, 8 and 7 times, respectively.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O’Connor’s 5 stolen bags was the most on the team with Steele Ledford and Jason Willow at 3 and 2, respectively.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with a 7-1 record at home and 6-1 on the road.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three batters had 10 or more RBIs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jorge Arellano Jr., Joshua Candau and Noah Owen all finished with a 0.00 ERA while Torra’s 0.36 and Michael McGreevy’s 0.99 were not far behind.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB had 10 pitchers finish with a sub-3.00 ERA and four with 20 or more strikeouts. Torra recorded 39 Ks and Rodney Boone recorded 31.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six UCSB pitchers finished with a K/9 of 9.00 or greater.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the status of COVID-19 everchanging, the current outlook is one that seeks to have in-person schooling upon the start of fall. Despite this, some schools have already announced remote instruction for their fall terms as well as even the entire year. At the moment, expect to see the Gauchos back on the field for 2021, but don’t be too surprised if remote instruction and social distancing extends into next spring. Stay safe and we hope to see Caesar Uyesaka Stadium filled once more!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/","id":3,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[2,1,0],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Jeike Meijer, UCSB’s 2018-2019 External Vice President for Local Affairs and an Indigenous student, called on senators to do more for Indigenous communities in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A couple of minutes at the beginning of a senate meeting is so small, if you think about it, and as student leaders your platforms said that you aim to represent minorities and more minority groups.

The Navajo Nation is currently experiencing an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-03/la-na-navajo-nation-coronavirus-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infection rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is higher than New York City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said the resolution also focuses on how the government “left [behind] the Navajo Nation” and “how they failed to provide for them” amidst a pandemic. The resolution details how the Navajo Nation has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and ensures the A.S. Senate will “continue to support the Navajo Nation through advocacy, awareness, and however stipulated by indigenous advocates.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were promised $8 million in aid, yet were only supplied body bags. And I really tried to hit home the idea that America genuinely does not care about Indigenous lives or Indigenous voices,” Quintero-Cubillan continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Quintero-Cubillan and Meijer emphasized the importance of holding the University of California (UC) accountable for harming indigenous communities, including the UC’s role in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/thirty-meter-telescope-has-received-68m-from-uc-in-past-six-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding the Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Hawaii which is planned to be built on sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“America is occupied land. People were forcibly removed, there was genocide. We’re still living with those impacts today. We’re still living with the trauma. It’s in everything that we do,” Meijer said during the public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said she is currently speaking with indigenous advocates on how to better support the Navajo Nation and plans on “introducing a bill that would immortalize the land acknowledgement,” as the resolution will grandfather out after the 71st Senate’s term ends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is so important because it cannot die with me,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like when we change the legal code, that’s when suddenly, regardless of whether or not I’m here, people will always have something to point to and be like, you need to do this right now.”</span></p>\n<p><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [6/06/2020 12:20]: This article has been corrected to reflect Mia Lopez’s position as the AISA’s tribal </i><i>liaison</i><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Indigenous has been capitalized. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Many people at the demonstration condemned Yang for his empty words and his failure to show up that day. Others referenced the lawsuits filed against the UC Police Department (UCPD) on the Santa Barbara campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May 2019, the Nexus reported that there were three active lawsuits against current and former members of the UCPD. Since then, more current and former officers have filed their own lawsuits. There are currently </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six active lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lawsuits allege serious misconduct by police officers within the department, including widespread racism and sexism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the university has failed to publicly address these lawsuits, or student concerns that stemmed from learning about them. Students, staff and faculty did not hear a single public assurance that these lawsuits or the misconduct alleged in them would be independently investigated, or that the department would be making any internal changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we did get were stories from The Current, the public relations arm of the university, </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new police chief, James Brock, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apparent changes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was making to the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus tried to interview Brock after he was first hired in April 2019 and after The Current published a </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about his “open-door policy” and “the importance of creating relationships with students and building trust between the student body and the department,” we were stonewalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any emails we sent to Brock were either ignored or directed to the public affairs department, who told us that Brock was too busy to speak with us directly and that we should email our questions to them, despite us emailing numerous times over the course of a month and offering flexibility in interview times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits are also not being dealt with publicly. Despite continuously reaching out to the lawyers, the Nexus has not been able to learn much about the progress of any internal mediations. As of April 2020, the university has been conducting an internal investigation into the allegations, according to a lawyer representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, the student body knows very little about what is happening within the UCSB Police Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December, Yang announced the </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2019-12-02-police-advisory-board\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Police Advisory Board. A memo about the board’s creation was posted to the Office of the Chancellor website, but there was no campus-wide email sent to the student body. Despite its goal of “enhanc[ing] communication between the police department and the campus community,” not a single email has been sent to students about the board’s progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers across the nation are protected by a lack of transparency and accountability within the criminal justice system that the UC and UCSB are perpetuating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yang wants to condemn and address the effects of police misconduct, he needs to start on this campus. Start by being transparent with the student body about what changes were made after the lawsuits were filed and about the disciplinary records of all the officers within the department. Students on this campus deserve to know who is policing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond UCSB, the UC system as a whole needs to do more. UC President Janet Napolitano and Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez sent out a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-protests-violence-following-george-floyd-s-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sunday condemning the recent racist killings of Black people and committing to “re-examine our own practices and ensure we continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing that we established two years ago.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC student journalist, Gabe Schneider, recently published an article titled “</span><a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/uc-campuses-have-disclosed-virtually-no-records-under-police-transparency-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Campuses Have Disclosed Virtually No Records Under Police Transparency Law,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that drew attention to how little transparency there is within UC police departments across the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schneider noted that the UC system “is aware of more than 200 incidents involving police use of force on its 10 campuses in recent years. Nearly half of those incidents resulted in the injury of an officer or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet only two police use of force case files have been released publicly,” Schneider wrote.                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s despite California Senate Bill 1421, a landmark transparency law that went into effect last year. It requires police to turn over internal records involving police shootings and use of force, and instances of sexual assault or lying by on-duty officers,” Schneider continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC needs to release these records, and it needs to be more transparent with students about the misconduct within its police departments.
