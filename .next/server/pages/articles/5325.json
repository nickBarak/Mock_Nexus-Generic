What they didn’t see coming was for one freshman to take command and emerge to play a pivotal role to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’, freshman setter Jonah Seif has combined his unique athletic ability and exceptional work ethic to handle the pressures of operating the team’s offense this season, quickly establishing himself as one of the premier players in the league in only his first year.</p>\n<p>“He’s been great. It’s really hard for a freshman to come in and make an immediate impact on our league and times that by 10 for a setter to do it,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “A setter has so many more responsibilities and he’s got to run the whole show and run the whole offense. Jonah is way beyond his years.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recruited by some of the other top-tier athletic programs in the country, such as Ohio State, UCLA and Pepperdine, it seems difficult to grasp the idea that Seif, a Thousand Oaks native, has only been playing the sport of volleyball for five years.</p>\n<p>“My dad used to play and he always urged me to play and I eventually did first year in high school,” Seif said.</p>\n<p>Growing nine inches in high school, Seif was quick to adjust to his rapid growth spurt and began to develop his work ethic, becoming a leader on the team by his senior year.</p>\n<p>Although he didn’t have much experience playing volleyball, Seif’s rare combination of size, quick footwork and great hands caught the attention of McLaughlin as early as his sophomore year at Thousand Oaks High School.</p>\n<p>“I watched him play a lot both his junior and senior year, watched him a little bit his sophomore year even that young,” McLaughlin said. “You could just see that he had something in the way he wanted to be good and what he did … He always had good hands and he’s a pretty pure setter. That’s what you catch right away when you watch him.”</p>\n<p>Already being familiar with UCSB from when he played in a basketball tournament earlier in his life, Seif’s familiarity with the campus as well as his love for the beach and its welcoming atmosphere convinced him UCSB was the right place. Yet Seif didn’t realize his own talents or potential until the latter part of his high school career.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really think I had a shot to play in college until probably just before senior year,” Seif said. “That’s when I realized that I could play in college.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Seif has assumed the role of the team’s starting setter, a position that comes with the responsibility of running the offense and getting the ball to the right hitter.</p>\n<p>With his amount of playing time, Seif has embraced the role of the team’s setter and has made his presence known to the entire conference. Averaging 10.70 assists per set, Seif ranks third in the MPSF in assists per set, and against Pacific, he recorded the first triple-double by a Gaucho this season and had a career-high 55 assists against No. 1 BYU.</p>\n<p>“When you look around the league there’s not a lot of freshmen who are starting their freshman year,” Seif said. “I feel extremely fortunate to be at this level right now and to be where I am.”</p>\n<p>The immediate impact and playing time Seif is having comes as a surprise to Seif himself, as he didn’t even envision playing significant minutes this year.</p>\n<p>“Coming into freshman year I didn’t think I would be getting anywhere close to this [amount of playing time],” Seif said. “I was hoping to be getting some playing time; where I am now is nowhere where I thought I would be a year ago.”</p>\n<p>Now midway through the season, Seif still finds difficulty in adjusting to the college game, especially its speed and the physical pounding the sport has taken on his body. Seif has shown tremendous maturity and relishes the role he has been given — the most difficult one on the team.</p>\n<p>“The hardest thing about being a setter I would say is that a lot of pressure falls on you to make the right play and you touch the ball every time,” Seif said. “There’s a lot of pressure in getting the ball to the right hitter in the right location, but I think that’s what I would say I love most about the position.”</p>\n<p>Besides developing chemistry on the court with his teammates, Seif also focuses on it off the court as he is majoring in chemistry and aspires to excel in the classroom just as much as he does when playing volleyball.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos still in contention for a playoff spot this year, Seif’s playing abilities will be crucial down the stretch, but his impact in later years will certainly not be limited to just his athleticism as he desires to become a team captain and win a championship at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He’s got unbelievable potential, he has not tapped two percent of that potential,” McLaughlin said. “This is a guy that could — if he keeps working hard — end up setting for our Olympic team at some point. We’re just fired up to have him here.”</p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 9  of February 13th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Cardinal finished the SoCal Tournament in third place after an 11-7 loss to No. 3 California in the semifinals. Stanford’s only previous league match came on Oct. 4 with a victory over No. 9 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>So far in the year, the Cardinal have been impressive with wins over UCLA, as well as victories over California, Pacific, and UCSD, three teams which have beaten UCSB this season. An advantage the Gauchos carry, however, is Stanford playing against USC the day before.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen them play at tournaments and they’re a good team,” said Whitelegge. “We played them over the summer and last spring and had some good matches.”</p>\n<p>Key players for Stanford will be junior driver Bret Bonanni, freshman driver Cody Smith and redshirt sophomore two meters Griffin Bolan. Bonanni has 54 goals this season and led the Cardinal in scoring in the SoCal tournament with 17 goals over five matches. In goal for Stanford will be sophomore Drew Holland; Holland came up huge in Stanford’s win over UCLA on Sunday with 10 saves in the match. His season-high 14 saves came in a win over UCSD on Sept. 20.</p>\n<p>“They’re a beatable team. I think we match up well,” senior utility Chase Racich said. “They are a fast team and one of our strengths is being able to slow teams down. I think we have a good chance to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need its top players to perform in order to give its team a chance to upset the Cardinal. Freshman attacker Shane Hauschild leads the team with 21 goals and 34 points. Senior utility Brendan McElroy ranks first on the team with 15 assists and is second with 27 points. Close behind are Racich and junior attacker Kevin Cappon who both have 25 points. Whitelegge has started all 15 games for the Gauchos this season and averages 9.7 saves per game.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a better chance of doing well in the one game format,” Racich said. “We do well when we are pumped up and our home fans are great, we get crazy amounts of support.”</p>\n<p>The match will commence at 12 p.m. on Sunday at Campus Pool.</p><div

The two teams have not played yet this season but they know each other well from watching each other play at tournaments.</p>\n<p>“[UCLA] plays really hard,” junior goalie Chris Whitelegge said. “We need to improve our counter defense this weekend and make less poor decisions on offense.”</p>\n<p>UCLA is coming off a season-changing victory over No. 4 California last Saturday. Sophomore Gordon Marshall scored a career-high five goals to lead the Bruins. The 6’7”, 240-pound center from Australia has 24 goals this season. Senior attacker Paul Reynolds had three goals while senior utility Cristiano Mirarchi added two. Sophomore goalie Garret Danner registered nine saves in the victory.</p>\n<p>The two losses for the Bruins this season have come at the hands of Stanford and No. 2 USC. They both occurred during the SoCal Tournament where UCLA settled for fourth place after losing to USC in the semifinals and Stanford in the third-place game. UCLA had beaten both of these teams earlier in the season, giving them reason to believe they still have a strong chance at winning the NCAA title this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is looking to change its tactics against the Bruins. With injuries to senior attacker Eric Van de Mortel and junior attacker Matthew Hamilton, the Gauchos experienced a lot of confusion the last few games in important offensive and defensive situations that led to turnovers and bad goals allowed. UCSB will be using a simplified plan on defense in order to play smarter against the Bruins after reviewing game film.</p>\n<p>On defense the team will expect a lot out of Whitelegge as he faces a strong, experienced attack. Senior utility Brendan McElroy, junior attacker Kevin Cappon and Racich will need to be in top form to stop the Bruins attackers and to keep them on the outside when taking shots.</p>\n<p>“The game’s going to come down to effort,” Whitelegge said. “We gotta match their intensity and outwork them in order to give ourselves the opportunity to win this match.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Bruins square off at noon on Sunday at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/water-polo-takes-on-ucla-at-campus-pool/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/water-polo-takes-on-ucla-at-campus-pool/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/water-polo-takes-on-ucla-at-campus-pool/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/water-polo-takes-on-ucla-at-campus-pool/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/water-polo-takes-on-ucla-at-campus-pool/","id":5323,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5322,5321,5320],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Season Finale to Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Senior night had no happy ending for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

Facing No. 6 Pepperdine at the Thunderdome Friday night, the Gauchos were spurred on by the pregame festivities honoring their four senior players and took the first set before dropping the next three sets to lose 3-1.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t come through with the big points after the first game the whole night; Pepperdine did,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Our serve was off after the first game. We had a lot of errors; they beat us pretty good even though the scores were close. It was pretty one-sided the last three games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the 2013 regular season at 15-15 overall and 11-13 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, finishing seventh place in the league and earning the seventh seed for the playoffs. After being ranked as low as 12th place in the MPSF in February, the Gauchos went on a seven-game winning streak in March that propelled them to a first-round matchup in the postseason against UC Irvine on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s kind of a bummer that we had to go out like this like in our last home game but we made playoffs, so that was our goal for the season,” senior outside hitter Grant Goswiller said. “We’re looking strong right now.”</p>\n<p>The Waves finish 14-11 overall and 13-11 in conference and will face UCLA in the first round of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came out strong in the opening moments of the match to take a commanding 10-4 lead in set one. The Waves made an effort to come back but the energy brought by the Gauchos enabled them to win the set 25-20, not giving up the lead the entire frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB once again took an early lead heading into second frame, but Pepperdine was able to even the game at 10 all before pulling ahead and winning the set 25-21. Fueled by a .409 hitting performance in the third game, the Waves won 25-19 to set up game four.</p>\n<p>Down 10-5 in the fourth, the Gauchos rallied behind senior middle blocker and team captain Dylan Davis, who scored six kills in the set and gave UCSB enough momentum to tie the game at 23. However, Pepperdine was able to earn the last two points of the set to outlast the Gauchos 25-23 and win the game 3-1.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t start off too hot but we ended up getting a lot of momentum and tied it back up,” Goswiller said. “The last couple balls just didn’t go our way.”</p>\n<p>Although limiting a majority of the Waves players, sophomore outside hitter Josh Taylor and senior opposite Maurice Torres accounted for 33 of Pepperdine’s 47 kills in the game. The two applied pressure on the Gaucho defense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>In his final regular season game at home, Davis led the way for the Gauchos with an impressive stat line of 10 kills, four digs and a .571 hitting percentage.
