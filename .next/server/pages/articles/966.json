With first-place Long Beach State winning two out of three from Pacific, the Gauchos end the season in second place in Big West, one game behind Long Beach.</p>\n<p>“They should be proud of what they did this past seven weeks,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They came out and performed after starting the season 1-10. I’m proud of this season and they should be proud of what they did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the season 30-28 overall and 15-6 in conference. The Gauchos’ second-place finish matches its best result in history, and its conference record was a program best. Northridge finishes their season on an eight-game losing streak, 10-42 overall and 5-16 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming into Saturday’s final game still in contention to earn the conference’s automatic berth to the NCAA tournament, Santa Barbara went up early in the first inning on junior shortstop Keilani Jennings’ two-run home run. Jennings’ seventh home run of the season was the most of any Gaucho this year. With the game 2-1 in the sixth inning, senior outfielder Brooke Putich singled with the bases loaded to add to the lead.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom, who went on to pitch all 21 innings of the series, struck out six batters and limited the Matadors to one run on three hits for a 4-1 win.</p>\n<p>“We were engaged in the win; our defense made the plays and our offense adjusted,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “We enjoyed each other and really playing together. Being present in the moment is what we did.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had no trouble scoring runs in the second game of Friday’s doubleheader. With the game scoreless, UCSB exploded in the fourth inning for a five-run inning. The Gauchos added on two extra runs in the seventh inning as Wisdom delivered her fifth home run of the season, a two-run blast over the left center field fence for a 7-0 win.</p>\n<p>Friday’s first match saw Wisdom’s first collegiate no-hitter. Wisdom retired the first nine batters she faced in order as the Gaucho offense also struggled manufacturing a run. Not until the seventh were the Gauchos able to break through with RBI hits by junior outfielder Jessica Soria and sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil to win 2-0.</p>\n<p>Only two Matador runners were able to reach base, both on fielding errors as Wisdom broke the school record for most strikeouts in a season in the process; she finished with 247 strikeouts on the season and 24 wins.</p>\n<p>“We expected [Wisdom] to do great things before she got here and she lived up to those expectations,” Galicinao said. “She’s really matured over the course of the year. It’s exciting we still have another three years with her.”</p>\n<p>With the season now over, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to next year where they will be lead by their two seniors, Jennings and Soria, and a talented supporting cast.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/","id":966,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[965,964,963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Poly in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last weekend.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get that sweep,” sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “It’s good we ended on a good note at Campus Diamond.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently in a three-way tie for second place in the Big West with a 27-28 overall record and 12-6 in conference, two games behind Long Beach State with only one series left in the season.

In the series finale, UCSB again came out swinging early in the game by way of the long ball; with runners on second and third, Jeppesen hit a three-run homerun for a 3-0 lead.

It was just a feeling I guess.”</p>\n<p>Jennings came into the program as a freshman ready to make an immediate impact, starting the first nine games of her career. However, Jennings suffered a devastating setback when she broke her leg, sidelining her for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was literally the first time I’ve ever been injured; I knew I wasn’t going to be able to play for the rest of the year,” Jennings said. “The second it happened I knew I broke my leg. It was definitely scary because I heard it crack and I was kind of in shock.”</p>\n<p>Despite suffering the season-ending injury, Jennings redshirted and returned the next year to lead the team in home runs and was one of three Gauchos to play in every single game, fulfilling the potential that was realized from her the year before.</p>\n<p>Building on her strong sophomore campaign, Jennings began the 2011 season by playing in 41 games and leading the team in batting average, slugging percentage and home runs. All was going according to schedule until injury struck Jennings once again. This time, a torn ACL sidelined her with another season-ending injury.</p>\n<p>“My second injury last year was harder; it was a different kind of feeling when you tear your ACL but I knew something was wrong because I wasn’t able to get up,” Jennings said. “It was really hard because your role as a teammate changes more as a supporter rather than actually being able to affect what’s going on on the field.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite suffering another devastating injury, Jennings was determined to come back and play for the Gauchos in her final two seasons of eligibility.</p>\n<p>“I knew I would be able to come back,” Jennings said. “I wanted it bad enough to be able to come back and play. It’s the sport I love to play.”</p>\n<p>Now in her fourth year as a Gaucho, Jennings has not showed any signs of slowing down, playing a huge part in the run the team has made this season — a run that has UCSB within reach of a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“She’s come back from a lot; she’s been working hard and putting in the work necessary to come back,” Galicinao said. “Hitting in the fourth spot is challenging and she still has success hitting from that spot.”</p>\n<p>Because of her redshirt status, Jennings has the opportunity of becoming one of the greatest hitters in UCSB history before she leaves. Quickly climbing the record books, she currently ranks fourth overall for most home runs with 21, and has cracked the top 10 in doubles and runs batted in. However, even with a long list of statistical accolades to her name, Jennings still remains focused on the team goal of winning the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m not one to focus on stats,” Jennings said. “Coming into the season, obviously the big team goal is to be Big West champs. Individually, I just came in basically just wanting to play softball. I was mainly there for the team goal and coming in and focusing on everything little by little.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Championship to be determined in the final weekend of the season, the Gauchos hope to make program history. But, looking ahead to next season, there is also reason for optimism — as long as Jennings is penciled into the lineup.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/","id":964,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[963,962,961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For the Love of the Game: The Resurgence of Gabe Vincent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gabe-MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gabe-MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last season, the UCSB men's basketball team was in the midst of its worst season in program history when they lost their star guard, Gabe Vincent.

Their fears were realized just one day later when an MRI revealed he had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and would be sidelined for a minimum of six-to-eight months.</p>\n<p>Vincent said that all he could think about was, “How soon can I play again?”</p>\n<p>“I never really second-guessed [the timetable] I was given. It took me a few weeks to really process what was going on, but after that I went through the motions of trying to come back and getting healthy.”</p>\n<p>For Coach Williams, the injury hurt him just the same. After all, he was the man that recruited Vincent to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I am heartbroken for Gabe and the team,” Williams said to UCSB Athletics. “He’s been a stud for three years and has also become our team’s leader. Knowing Gabe, I believe he will bounce back from this and be stronger than ever.”</p>\n<p>Williams got it right with that last statement.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGE</strong></p>\n<p>Once the 2017 season ended, Vincent was met with the bad news that his senior season would come with the shellshock of having to work with an entirely new coaching staff.</p>\n<p>Following a disappointing 6-22 season and missing the Big West Tournament, the university decided not to extend Williams’s contract and go in a different direction.</p>\n<p>While obviously saddened by the news, Vincent knew he had his own worries that he needed to take care of.</p>\n<p>“It really hurt a lot; me and Bob [Williams] were close, and he recruited me, and he was a big part of the reason I came to UCSB,” Vincent said. “With that being said, that’s how this business goes, and we knew we had to move forward, and we responded well.”</p>\n<p>While coming back from an ACL tear is nothing new in this day and age thanks to wonderful medical advances, it is still a long grind, and not everyone returns to peak form.</p>\n<p>To Vincent’s credit, he never thought negatively. He put his head down and worked every single day to be ready come the season opener in 2018.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a struggle. I don’t think there is anyone that has been hurt in that way who can tell you it is easy,” Vincent said. “It’s not a fun process, not easy, but you just have to take it day by day. You have good days and bad days, but at the end you’re working to come back.”</p>\n<p>And while Vincent was working hard, the UCSB administrative staff was working hard as well, hoping to add another great basketball coach to the rotation. On April 4, UCSB introduced Joe Pasternack as their new head coach, and right away he went to work adding graduate transfers Marcus Jackson and Leland King II.</p>\n<p>Along with the additions, Pasternack was adamant about bringing his new philosophy to this team and bring a new attitude. Most importantly, he wanted to bring a new culture, one that “honors the process.”</p>\n<p>“Coach Pasternack did a great job of bringing in a great staff and great guys like Marcus and Leland to help us compete,” Vincent said. “He is a real competitor and he loves to win, and that’s what he is all about.”</p>\n<p>All this constant activity and excitement only made the former St. Mary’s High School standout anxious.</p>\n<p><strong>RESURGENCE</strong></p>\n<p>Still, all his hard work would pay off as on Saturday, Nov. 11, Vincent returned right on schedule to start the season opener against North Dakota State.</p>\n<p>While breakout sophomore guard Max Heidegger stole the stage with an astonishing 33 points in the Gauchos 85-66 win, Vincent was still there, playing as hard as ever. The senior would finish the night with seven points and a career high of eight assists on just 17 minutes.</p>\n<p>“My greatest memory [in these last four years] is probably my first game back from injury,” Vincent said. “Suiting back up with the guys again after something that happened so tragically, and in the midst of such a terrible season, to turning it around to what this season has become is unbelievable.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79677\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1586438169\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81741\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79677\" data-attachment-id=\"79677\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-tops-nebraska-omaha-77-70-for-seventh-straight-victory-travel-for-sat-match-against-montana-state/2017-11-11_stephenmanga_mbasketball-16-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79677\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79677\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coming back after a torn left ACL, Gabe Vincent jumps for the hoop. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As games kept coming and going, Vincent and the Gauchos would just get better and better.</p>\n<p>Against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome, a game that was televised on ESPNU, Vincent stole the show. The senior dropped a then season-high 21 points on the Anteaters and led the Gauchos to a primetime win. Even better, it was his first full game without his knee brace, as it broke just a few nights earlier against, coincidentally enough, Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I planned on getting out of the brace a week later so really it just came early; so it was different, but it worked out well, and now I feel stronger and stronger every day,” Vincent said.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the current day, and UCSB has more than tripled its win total from the last season with a 21-7 overall mark and is currently fighting for first place in the conference standings heading into the final week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>From six wins to 21, this season has been a complete 180 for Vincent.</p>\n<p>“It is special. I mean, this group we have in general is special. They are a big part of the reason why I wanted to get back so quickly … because I saw the potential this team had,” Vincent said. “Now we just have to finish this the right way and set out what we wanted to accomplish at the beginning of the year.”</p>\n<p>Like Vincent said at the end, however, the mission is still not over.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have goals of winning the Big West Tournament and making an NCAA run.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean the former Big West Freshman of the Year shouldn’t enjoy his final home games, though. In a 70-69 loss against LBSU on Thursday, Vincent scored a career high 28 points.</p>\n<p>The loss may have overshadowed Vincent’s new career high, but if Thursday highlighted anything, it is that Vincent is back and he will be a problem come tournament time.</p>\n<p>The senior is now averaging 12.6 points per game, on a career high 45 percent shooting heading into his final game at the Thunderdome to culminate what will be a spectacular career.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, this whole season has been pretty emotional, coming back from injury, day by day knowing it’s my last season, so things have been building up,” Vincent said. “I’m sure it will be emotional, but I just have to harness it into a good game.”</p>\n<p><strong>RIVALRY/FINALE</strong></p>\n<p>As luck would have it, Vincent’s final home game will be Saturday against the Gauchos biggest rival, Cal Poly. The Mustangs stole the first meeting between the Blue-Green rivals, 80-79.</p>\n<p>“The rivalry is real; I don’t know how else to put it. Even being at SLO is just different,” Vincent said. “But I am happy to compete against them again, especially after dropping that last game. It was my first loss to Cal Poly during my time here. I took it real personally, so I am excited to get them back over here.”</p>\n<p>With Saturday marking the end of Vincent’s brilliant career, one might surmise that he wants to be the one to steal the show.</p>\n<p>But those who know him personally know that Vincent is as humble as they come.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be just another game. If I go off, I go off, and if I don’t, I don’t, but as long as we get a win at the end of the day,” Vincent said.</p>\n<p>Beyond this season, if there is one thing Vincent loves, it is basketball. This will not be his final stop, something he is very adamant about.</p>\n<p>“NBA is the dream, always has been and definitely is not something I plan on giving up on now,” Vincent said. “Even if I can’t make it, this is still going to be my career. I have to make money somehow so whether it be overseas or G-League, I am just going to be excited to continue my career.”</p>\n<p>If there is one thing this piece highlights, it is that Vincent is as resilient as they come. The senior is going to leave behind quite a legacy here at UCSB, and yet, all he wants to be remembered as is “a good teammate and a guy that loves to compete and win.”</p>\n<p>That will not be a problem, Gabe.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":kt\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" aria-label=\"Show trimmed content\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
