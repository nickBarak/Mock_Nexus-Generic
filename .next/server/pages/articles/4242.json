Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden. </span><em>Britta Good / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an open-source transformational arts and music festival</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, first introduced the idea for a spring festival during Deltopia to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Tuesday’s meeting, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt expressed the board’s sentiments that Deltopia in its current state, a fundamentally disorganized event that draws thousands of out-of-towners, creates a public safety concern for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQrErSI9EG7M_swcZiaWwgXZE0SA\">Deltopia 2019</a> saw 94 citations, 38 arrests, 19 medical transports and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/police-arrest-two-deltopia-visitors-on-armed-robbery-charges/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595548000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHa24jfKBR84l_Epw29OokNZ08eXw\">one serial robbery</a> — causing the month of April to have the highest number of arrests in comparison to previous months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deltopia, as it exists, is not a safe environment. We see a spike in physical assaults, in sexual assaults. We see a spike in medical transports as a result of alcohol and drugs,” Brandt said at the meeting on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our board’s thought has always been to provide people with a fun alternative where the community has the ability to plan the event, plan the content of the event and have a better handle on what the security presence looks like that we can change the overall feel to be a much safer event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Proposal-V2-Includes-Budget-Site-Map-Security-Plan-IV-April-Event-2020-4.pdf\">current proposal</a> has the festival centered in the I.V. Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden featuring local breweries. The plan also includes detailed information regarding local community collaboration, security and the budget for the overall project, with expenses totalling $184,850.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire board unanimously expressed concern over the price tag of the event. According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD, there are two main options to cover the cost of the event in the budget: a UCSB grant, or the $100,000 reserve allocation currently in the budget. UCSB can grant $93,000 under one condition — the university must reach an agreement with the I.V. CSD as to what the expenses are for. However, Director George Thurlow expressed doubts as to whether UCSB would be willing to fund a community festival versus placing the money directly into public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ways to cover the cost of the festival could include sponsorships from local businesses and funding from the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD). Carlos Lopez, chairperson for the IVRPD, attended the meeting and said the IVRPD Board of Directors is willing to negotiate partially funding the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lopez also suggested a system of pre-registration for the festival where people could sign up online for a QR code that would grant them access to the event. A safety agreement and confirmation of residence in I.V. would accompany the QR code to deter outsiders from attending the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, possible sources of revenue could also come from local sponsorships and the beer garden. Tickets could be sold for the beer garden, in the style of a beer tasting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will also be foregoing the addition of food trucks to the festival — something they predicted would cause pushback from local businesses and go against their vision of a community-controlled event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel emphasized the Safety, Security and Harm Reduction Plan of the proposal to better respond to the annual problems Deltopia brings. It includes the Guardian Team, a security service “with focus on de-escalation, harm reduction, and crisis management,” <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardianteam.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1c8D18DVtMBpd6p5IRgQgFRpfKw\">according to its website</a>, as well as a large medical team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we really pride ourselves on at Lucidity is we have a very, very well-staffed medical team on site. If anybody has any immediate emergency, we have the ability to support them right there and then,” Marvel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a proposal to end the event around 4 p.m. to funnel people toward UCSB’s campus event, The Warm Up, which typically begins at 6 p.m., Alan Avila, co-founder and head of security at Lucidity, said he is willing to negotiate to make the security and medical teams available until 10 p.m. or midnight should a situation arise where they are needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the festival’s budget still remains the primary concern for the directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have any of you electeds gone out in the community and said, ‘This is going to cost 180k of your utility user [tax], [and] you’re paying [for] it?’” Thurlow asked the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand echoed Thurlow’s thoughts and voiced his own concerns regarding the I.V. CSD’s ability to tackle the project as a newly formed entity and suggested approaching UCSB’s Associated Students for greater collaboration with the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am still a little bit concerned about the potential for this being a much bigger event during an already unsanctioned event,” Bertrand said. “I am definitely in support of scaling this down in any way that we can and aspiring to, in the next few years, put on this full event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the next I.V. CSD meeting will have a more in-depth revision of the budget, as well as possible updates from negotiations with other organizations. With the festival plans requiring months of preparation, Abboud says the board will have to make a decision soon over whether or not to actually hold the festival, possibly by the last I.V. CSD meeting of October or the first meeting of November.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The junior utility had a game-high four hits in five at-bats and one RBI. He would later score his first of three runs on the day after a UCI error by the third baseman on a freshman utility Armani Smith at bat giving the ’Chos a 1-0 lead after the first inning.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UCI in the top of the fourth got a leadoff double from the Big West’s batting average leader junior utility Keston Hiura. Irvine parlayed the two-base knock into one run, trying the game.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the frame, the Gauchos responded in a big way as sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen homered to right field for a two-run shot, giving his team the 3-1 lead after four innings.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a momentum shifter after that one run Irvine put up,” Cohen said. “Our dugout needed some energy and something to get us going and a two-run homer does that.”</p>\n<p>After a quick inning from Davis, UCSB gave its starting pitcher a very comfortable 7-1 lead after scoring four runs in the bottom of the fifth, all coming from RBI singles by junior infielder Austin Bush, Corey, redshirt junior shortstop JJ Muno and Cohen.</p>\n<p>Irvine would cause trouble at the top of the next inning, scoring two runs, but the game never got any closer than that as the Gauchos kept swinging the bat well and scored one run in the bottom of the sixth and three in the seventh to make the game 11-3 after seven full.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, Davis looked as though he would go the full nine, but he fell just a bit short, pitching 8.1 innings and earning himself the win along with five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen Noah pitch like that, that’s kind of our expectation for him,” Checketts said. “Frankly we are a bit more shocked when it’s not like that.”</p>\n<p>His performance could go a long way in this series as the Gauchos were able to preserve a short-staffed bullpen. Freshman pitcher Conner Roberts stepped in and got the final two outs of the game to secure UCSB’s 11-3 series-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looks like a team that might be on the verge of really turning that corner if it hasn’t done so already. The hitting seems to be there, and as long as the starting pitchers can put together a lengthy, solid start, the Gauchos might be in store for another postseason run.</p>\n<p>That being said, tomorrow is just another game for a team that is under .500, and before UCSB starts thinking about any postseason fantasies, it has to continue its high level of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face the Anteaters for game two at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 14, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

This is the same Irvine team that managed to take two of three against the then No. 1 team in the country TCU in early March.</p>\n<p>Despite having played pretty bad baseball over the last few week, the Anteaters still have three hitters currently batting over .300 including Keston Hiura. The junior currently leads the Big West in batting average with a .394 mark, and he has six home runs to tag along with that. In fact, UCI also holds the top spot in the conference in terms of batting average boasting a .275.</p>\n<p>“UCI is certainly well coached but they have had their struggles lately, kind of limping in like us,” Checketts said. “But I expect a chance to be able to be more aggressive offensively especially later in the weekend due to the pitching coming in.”</p>\n<p>As Checketts alluded to, the problem for the ‘Eaters is the play from the mound. Irvine has the worst team ERA in the conference (6.01), most hits allowed (311) and most earned runs allowed (170). Their three starters all combine to allow a 4.7 ERA.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76872\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76872\" data-attachment-id=\"76872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-welcomes-uci-in-must-win-conference-series/jack-dashwood-throws-a-fastball-jorge-mercado-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-JorgeMercado-01-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jack Dashwood throws a fastball.

UCSB’s pitching staff has also been better in Santa Barbara as they combine for a solid 3.31 ERA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and an inferior 6.97 ERA on the road.</p>\n<p>In terms of key players to watch out for, junior Colton Burns has been magnificent this season with a slash line of .355/.466/.464. His batting average ranks fifth best in the conference while his on-base percentage ranks him second. The utility has been solid over the last six ball games going 9 for 23 from the plate including three games with multiple hits.</p>\n<p>Coming off a big game against Nevada in a win on Tuesday, Corey will look to continue his great play in this series. Currently, he is third and fifth on the team in on-base percentage (.395) and batting average (.288), respectively. On Tuesday, the redshirt junior went 2 for 4 from the plate with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos in the Thursday opener, sophomore Noah Davis will need to be the ace he once was earlier in the year if he wants his team to grab the early series lead.</p>\n<p>Against LBSU in the Big West opener, the right-hander was great going 7.1 innings allowing just six hits and two earned runs. Last week, however, at CSUN, Davis allowed 11 hits and seven earned runs in six innings punching out only three batters.</p>\n<p>“Noah has been hit or miss,” Checketts said. “He either shuts you out, or he gives up seven. I think we are due for the guy that shuts you out.”</p>\n<p>Friday starter Kyle Nelson has been improving steadily as the season has gone on. The junior currently has a 3.74 ERA, 16<sup>th</sup> best mark in the conference, and 41 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Both teams realize the importance of not only this weekend, but the rest of the conference season in general. UCSB and UCI, even with their struggles, are still comprised of teams that have great potential to go out and take the Big West crown, but it starts with this series.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UCI for the first of a three-game set at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 13 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
