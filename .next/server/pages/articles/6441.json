He jolted up, looked at me, and then with a disappointed look on his face, muttered, “Shit, I thought I got laid for a second.” After deciding to interpret that as a compliment about my honorability (my <em>what</em>?), I realized that I, too, usually only wake up next to a someone in bed after several bouts of back-bending bliss. I pondered for a moment, then considered: Was this non-physical disappointment exemplary of a dry spell?</p>\n<p>As you can probably guess, I’m unfamiliar with the details of sexual dehydration. This multi-faceted concept recently piqued my interest, however, and I learned that despite the hordes of happy (read: drunken) revelers eager to exchange their goods (read: bodies) with only the most respectful courtier (read: Gropey McGroperson), coeds still manage to find themselves smack dab in the middle of a slump. I’ve heard accounts of dry spells ranging from two weeks to nine months to 21 years. When this kind of biological disaster occurs in nature, panic ensues. I’m in no position to judge the weary desert travelers seeking relief in the form of Chatroulette’s endless supply of naked dicks, but maybe it’s time to end the drought. That’s right, we’re gonna need a rain dance.</p>\n<p>There is something to be said for a regular source of fluids, that’s for sure. Boyfriends and girlfriends are rarely spotted in the sandy dunes of frequent masturbation, and they’re usually adequately appreciative of their sources. However, it’s essential for these people to pay attention to the water, to keep external particles from clogging it up, or the faucet will stop putting out. In my experience, sex is the first thing to go in a relationship. If the water pressure gets awkwardly low, it might be time to let someone else get under the sink and perk up the pipes themselves, you know? It could be that one person’s puddle is another person’s super duper hot spring.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A dry spell may leave you dizzy, weak and vulnerable. Beware of the sweaty gym rats who’ll lure you in with promises of treasure and instead hand you an ultimatum with a side of crabs. There are few benefits of a forced relationshit when you’re in the fragile state of revirginization, wouldn’t you agree? That’s sort of like being the Vietnamese baby handcuffed at the ankles in Vegas this weekend — it’s an effective captivity, but unnecessarily humiliating. Don’t let your fear of monogamy keep you from diving headfirst into the pool, though. Remember: There’s a big, fat, happiness-stuffed line between “Can I hang out with my friends tonight?” and “Bitch get naked.” In this cheerful, colorful paradise there are friends and friends of friends ready to slurp and be slurped up. It’s these enthusiasts the sex gods smile upon, and they shall never go thirsty.</p>\n<p>But where to find this magic land? Under what cushion, through what looking glass, in what glory hole can we find the map to the nearest roaring rapids? To get there, we must accept the challenge of change. I think that means that when you’re surrounded by five equally attractive paths pointing you toward a similarly refreshing drink, you’re going to have to pick one. Yes, just one. I think it also means you’ll need to alternate your attentions between the UV and the blonde in the strappy sandals. And, unfortunately, I think it means that instead of hibernating in your house playing a Billy Madison<em> </em>drinking game by yourself, you need to check out that cute guy’s big screen TV with over 600 channels.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there’s an oasis in sight: Cinco de Mayo will supply us with unlimited beer and bodies. It’s like having an endless supply of Gatorade — ready to quench your thirst?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-05/avoiding-dangers-sexual-dehydration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-05/avoiding-dangers-sexual-dehydration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-05/avoiding-dangers-sexual-dehydration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-05/avoiding-dangers-sexual-dehydration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-05/avoiding-dangers-sexual-dehydration/","id":6441,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6440,6439,6438],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[5709,5710,5717,6012,6093,6095,6096,6123,6125,6127,6128,6132,6151,6152,6160,6165,6172,6174,6175,6176,6178,6182,6187,6194,6195,6211,6215,6216,6218,6232,6247,6248,6252,6253,6260,6261,6314,6331,6343,6358,6393,6394,6396,6401,6412,6416,6423,6424,6439,6441,6446,6447,6456,6458],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Patience and Practice Overcome Fear of Finding the Female Orgasm","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Ever heard the expression, “The harder you have to work for it, the better it is”?

If you are one of these women, it is likely that either psychological inhibitions are cock-blocking your climax or a lack of personal exploration has rendered you naive to the rush of joyful potential tucked between your legs.

It isn’t a nuisance or a distraction; it is sexy and fulfilling for both parties. The female orgasm has long been treated like the mystical stone hidden in the “Temple of Doom.” Does the g-spot exist? Can squirting be controlled? Why is the bitch next door having multiple orgasms when I’m dry as a desert? The reason why female ejaculation is so veiled with myth and wonder is because it’s often the blind leading the blind down there. Men are desperately clawing away at and rubbing their faces in territories that women have not fully staked their claim in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Probably the most common issue a woman will have with reaching orgasm is feeling guilty or self-conscious that she is taking too long to come, which is why women fake orgasms so often. Yes, it’s true — women fake it constantly. There is a certain point when we feel awkward and exposed and just want to move on and give the guy his satisfaction. If you want the woman you are pleasuring to actually get where you want her to go, you need to remind her that you love making her come and you have all night (or all afternoon) to make sure that happens for real. If she feels comfortable, relaxed and not pressured, the chances of her breaking out into an acted scene of moaning and panting out of sheer frustration will go way down. Keep in mind that the average woman will take 15 to 40 minutes to reach orgasm, so if you want to see toe-curling results, you’re going to have to put in the time.</p>\n<p>It’s called “achieving orgasm” for a reason. I feel like giving a guy a gold star if he can actually push me across the finish line, particularly due to the fact that the majority of women don’t orgasm from penile penetration. When a guy is like, “Come with me,” I’m like, “Listen honey, you have to hold it in so you don’t explode too early — I’m just warming up the engine here.” Additionally, more women are able to orgasm with a regular sexual partner, which is clearly because each woman’s body is different and one must learn the specific touches, strokes and licks each vulva responds to. This is partially why it is difficult to give general advice about making a woman come, but I’ll give it a shot.</p>\n<p>Think of the clit as a penis that stopped growing. It is all the sensation of your tip, packed into a pin-sized ball of wildly sensitive nerve endings. The clit is covered up by a hood, which should be slightly pulled back, up or apart to expose the part most sensitive to touch. Girls, if you aren’t quite sure what I’m talking about, you need to go to your make-up bag right now, (unless you’re reading this in class) take out your compact and look at your clit. You need to see what he sees when he’s working his ass off trying to make you scream.</p>\n<p>Not that you guys want to think about what it would be like to suck on your own dick, but think of it as if you were sucking on your own dick. The clit has a shaft just like yours that should be licked from base to top and a tip that should be sucked on, played with, flicked with your tongue and lubricated. If she’s not giving you verbal instruction or moaning nudges, it’s perfectly okay and welcomed to ask her how hard she wants it and how fast she needs it, even to point to the exact spot that sends her rocket flying into space.</p>\n<p>If she does respond to internal stimulation, enter her simultaneously with your fingers or your penis. Push down below her belly button when you’re on top to push her clit onto your shaft while you’re thrusting or massage her clit while she’s riding you on top. Also, try fucking her externally by moving your member up and down her clit instead of in and out. And remember that, although once a man is in the end zone and is headed for touchdown whether he’s ready or not, women can easily retract from their point of no return. Keep it steady and constant all the way through or all your hard work may just go to waste.</p>\n<p>Women, just stay relaxed and enjoy something you definitely shouldn’t feel bad about; and men, R.S.V.P. her clit for the night. Together, we can make this world a more equally pleasured place.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/patience-practice-overcome-fear-finding-female-orgasm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/patience-practice-overcome-fear-finding-female-orgasm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/patience-practice-overcome-fear-finding-female-orgasm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/patience-practice-overcome-fear-finding-female-orgasm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/patience-practice-overcome-fear-finding-female-orgasm/","id":6438,"author":{"id":539,"name":"Samantha Forcum"},"related":[6437,6436,6435],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leftover Lovers Satisfy the Cunning Gourmet","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Imagine coming home from a night on the town. You’re hungry, drunk and totally out of food.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Imagine coming home from a night on the town. You’re hungry, drunk and totally out of food. Mechanically, you peer in the fridge, hoping to find that the microwavable burrito you ate for dinner magically reappeared during your absence. Instead, you find yourself face to face with your roommate’s leftover pizza. This presents you with a plethora of opportunities: Close the fridge and risk a serious hangover, quickly and appreciatively devour a piece and hope it goes unnoticed, or guzzle the entire thing and offer to replace the pizza when said roommate notices the discarded crusts the next morning. Decisions, decisions. The good thing about this scenario is that pizza is replaceable (unless it’s pineapple, in which case, STEP OFF, BITCH!). Replace pizza with people, however, and the guzzlers get slightly screwed. Trader Joe’s doesn’t carry readymade people in the frozen section, and when you decided to surreptitiously munch on your best friend’s ex-girlfriend, you must decide: Confess or not confess? That is the question.</p>\n<p>There are several ingredients to consider before making your final decision. First, there’s the freshness factor. If you’re trying to mack on your bff’s leftovers right as she’s leaving the table, there’s a chance that she was planning to come back for seconds. Trust me, the last thing you want is to get caught with your hand in the cookie jar… especially when the cookie jar is her ex-flame’s still-unbuttoned pants. As any self-respecting college student knows, the longer leftovers are neglected, the greater the chances you’ll be able to snag a piece. While I certainly wouldn’t dare reduce passionate lovers to stale fast food (although they’re both great for breakfast, lunch or dinner), the similarities are striking. When they don’t belong to you, it’s important to make sure the original owner is thoroughly through feasting — literally and, well, literally.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the owner to consider. If you’re sneaking nookie sessions with your hairdresser’s nephew’s neighbor, I think we can agree that the term “sloppy seconds” isn’t nearly as accurate as “Oh my god! I have that strain of herpes, too!” Just a few weeks ago, my inquiry as to the girthiness of my friend’s latest squeeze could have been answered by a number of females in the car. There was no awkwardness, however, thanks to the girls’ distant relationships at the time of the nudy sessions. If anything, it’s a handy “titbit” to exploit during 10 fingers! However, if you’re trying to mess with someone a little closer to home, say, your homie’s high school sweetheart he dumped last week, that’s a horse of a different color. If you want to stay friends with this homie, you’re going to have to wait for that tempting, long-legged slice to cool down a bit before you get the sauce in and around your mouth.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you <em>must </em>consider the toppings. Let’s say you’re famished, and your roommate orders a pizza. As her confidant and perpetual borrower of her clothes, filching a piece with her favorite flavors is a great way to find yourself cut off from her wardrobe… and discarded sexual conquests. If she enjoys her men hung like horses, try to avoid the piece dripping with sausages. Find an alternative — if she’s less than enthusiastic about the ginger she snubbed last week, but has a soft spot for Latinos, snag the slice with sun-dried tomatoes rather than the one with spicy, tanned, muscle-rippling jalapenos.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista is a small town, and it gets smaller every year. It’s nearly impossible to find a bedroom door that not one of your friends has tapped, but that certainly doesn’t mean you’re doomed to an everlasting dry spell. Remember, sharing is caring — it sure can be fun!</p>\n<p>And if your roommate berates you for feasting on their sloppy seconds without permission, remind them that you only got naked with the cheesy bastard so you wouldn’t get sauce on the shirt you borrowed that night. Now that’s courtesy.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/leftover-lovers-satisfy-cunning-gourmet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/leftover-lovers-satisfy-cunning-gourmet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/leftover-lovers-satisfy-cunning-gourmet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/leftover-lovers-satisfy-cunning-gourmet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/leftover-lovers-satisfy-cunning-gourmet/","id":6439,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6438,6437,6436],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cheaters Never Prosper, Especially in the Bedroom","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In school we are taught that cheating is an extremely severe offense punishable with failure and in some cases expulsion, but how many of you sneaky bastards have gotten away with a little dishonesty ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In school we are taught that cheating is an extremely severe offense punishable with failure and in some cases expulsion, but how many of you sneaky bastards have gotten away with a little dishonesty from time to time? The fact is, students pull fast ones on their teachers all the time, only to yield a passing grade and no consequence. If we allow our morals to relax in one area of our lives, where do we draw the line elsewhere if we do indeed get away with it? Calling all monogamists: today’s class discussion is “Degrees of Cheating.”</p>\n<p>So they didn’t sleep together, but he tells her intimate details he won’t disclose to you. They’ve never kissed, but have been exchanging “sexts” for the past week. She lied to you about letting her ex buy her a drink at a club. Are you in the wrong for feeling angry and betrayed?</p>\n<p>The fact is, jealousy is seriously dangerous territory. It can be healthy in small doses, but poisonous in excess. If your partner’s jealousy is smothering you and removing all stability and trust from the relationship, then it’s time to call it quits. However, the topic of discussion at hand may in some cases justify suspicion and jealousy to a certain degree.

Technological advancements have made casual cheating a part-time hobby. No longer must we stage a secret rendezvous at an out-of-town motel wearing oversized sunglasses and a cheap wig to get our juices flowing with another; we just have to boot up and log on. In this gray area of Facebook invites and picture texts, what does getting caught red-handed even entail?</p>\n<p>I think it’s fair to say that cheating begins with lying — if you feel like you need to lie about your actions or feelings, then you are engaging in deceit. A relationship should be open and honest, period. You should feel like you can have friends of the opposite sex and be trusted by your lover around them. If you’ve compromised that trust, you’re probably cheating.</p>\n<p>Alright, so maybe you do love your boyfriend or girlfriend, but get wasted one night only to wake up the next morning in an unfamiliar bed spooning an unexpected naked body. What should you do about a one-time slipup? Do you blab to get it off your chest or keep your mouth shut to avoid the backlash? I think it’s important that you first ask yourself why you got into this situation. Are you dissatisfied with your relationship, out of love or lacking the attention you need? If so, then you might consider the indiscretion as a wake-up call. If, however, you really do feel like it was a one-time mistake, it is better to zip it and bear the burden yourself than to break the heart of the person you love over something emotionally meaningless to you. Feeling guilty is your punishment, so suck it up.</p>\n<p>And what about a reversed situation? If your beau strays, do you forgive and move forward together or send him/her packing for good? Well, I’m from the school of thought that says sex is something corporeal and instinctive that often doesn’t come with emotional attachment. In other words, not all cheaters are made equal. If your partner had a lusty accident with some fox on the dance floor, that is entirely different than feeling emotionally attached to another person. Sex can be forgiven, love cannot.</p>\n<p>But, if you are very sensitive in this department and believe any form of cheating is betrayal, you may not feel comfortable staying with someone you don’t trust. Just listen to your gut.
