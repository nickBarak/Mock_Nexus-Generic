The junior utility had a game-high four hits in five at-bats and one RBI. He would later score his first of three runs on the day after a UCI error by the third baseman on a freshman utility Armani Smith at bat giving the ’Chos a 1-0 lead after the first inning.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UCI in the top of the fourth got a leadoff double from the Big West’s batting average leader junior utility Keston Hiura. Irvine parlayed the two-base knock into one run, trying the game.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the frame, the Gauchos responded in a big way as sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen homered to right field for a two-run shot, giving his team the 3-1 lead after four innings.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a momentum shifter after that one run Irvine put up,” Cohen said. “Our dugout needed some energy and something to get us going and a two-run homer does that.”</p>\n<p>After a quick inning from Davis, UCSB gave its starting pitcher a very comfortable 7-1 lead after scoring four runs in the bottom of the fifth, all coming from RBI singles by junior infielder Austin Bush, Corey, redshirt junior shortstop JJ Muno and Cohen.</p>\n<p>Irvine would cause trouble at the top of the next inning, scoring two runs, but the game never got any closer than that as the Gauchos kept swinging the bat well and scored one run in the bottom of the sixth and three in the seventh to make the game 11-3 after seven full.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, Davis looked as though he would go the full nine, but he fell just a bit short, pitching 8.1 innings and earning himself the win along with five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen Noah pitch like that, that’s kind of our expectation for him,” Checketts said. “Frankly we are a bit more shocked when it’s not like that.”</p>\n<p>His performance could go a long way in this series as the Gauchos were able to preserve a short-staffed bullpen. Freshman pitcher Conner Roberts stepped in and got the final two outs of the game to secure UCSB’s 11-3 series-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looks like a team that might be on the verge of really turning that corner if it hasn’t done so already. The hitting seems to be there, and as long as the starting pitchers can put together a lengthy, solid start, the Gauchos might be in store for another postseason run.</p>\n<p>That being said, tomorrow is just another game for a team that is under .500, and before UCSB starts thinking about any postseason fantasies, it has to continue its high level of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face the Anteaters for game two at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 14, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) board members, county officials and I.V. residents gathered at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar to celebrate the new Isla Vista Community Center’s soft opening. The hard opening date has yet to be released, but I.V. CSD board members are hoping to hold an  official opening sometime between January and March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the February 1970 I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank burning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here celebrating how far we’ve come because it wasn’t that long ago, this building was about to fall over,” said I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no current activities or initiatives are slated for the community center, Brandt said he was interested in using the space to run a variety of programs. Potential ways in which residents may be able to use the space include English classes, homework help for school children, computer literacy classes, yoga classes and a litany of other similar programs, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD paid the Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) $177,000, using funds obtained by a tax on all I.V. residents’ utilities, to manage the community center for one year, according to Lori Goodman, executive director of IVYP. Goodman added that approximately $150,000 of the money will be used to pay its two full-time staff members, while the rest is for potential programs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The County of Santa Barbara paid for the majority of renovations to the building, spending $1,320,000 to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, build two bathrooms and install a kitchen. About $400,000 of that money came from the county’s general fund, according to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann; the rest came from the federal government through Community Development Block Grants, which Hartmann said made the project possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on community feedback, the I.V. CSD is planning additional renovations to the building, including covering the cement ground of the center with hardwood floor. The district is also looking into grants which could further fund renovations, according to Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space has always been a hub for the community of Isla Vista back when I came here in the 60s,” said I.V. CSD Board Member Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, who used to run his church out of the building.  “One of the reasons our community kind of flailed, is because we didn’t have a community center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soft opening inspired Carmen Lodise, who lived in Isla Vista for 30 years and was one of the original activists fighting for a community center, to come from his home in Mexico to witness what he had been wanting to see for decades. Lodise is also the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wonderful. It brought tears to my eyes,” Lodise said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to open the center began in the 1970s, when the building that now houses the Isla Vista Clinic was sold, prompting activists to seek a new space where everyone in the community could congregate, according to Lodise’s book. The calls for a community center would go unfulfilled until the county bought the community center building, formerly a church and bank, in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2012</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD wants more community input on possible uses for the community center before committing to any specific programming, according to Brandt. Diana Collins Puente floated the idea that UC Santa Barbara professors could use the community center for class space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a litany of historical hiccups and delays, the community center — long awaited by many — marks a milestone in the eyes of a town that is eager to put such a facility to use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been a gleam in people’s eyes for decades, but it really took a lot at the last minute to get this done,” Hartmann said during a speech.</span></p><div

rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020, prohibits landlords from raising rents more than 5% when they renew contracts with ongoing tenants. The law will also increase protections for renters; now, landlords must have “just cause” for evicting a tenant who has lived in the property for more than a year, and no-fault evictions will require the landlord to reimburse their tenant for at least one month’s rent.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AB 1482 will fight rent gouging and unjust evictions to help protect millions of Californians who rent the place they call home,” Assemblymember Rob Bonta(D-Oakland), who helped author the bill, said in a press release. Assemblymembers Bonta, Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and Tim Grayson (D-Concord) also co-authored the bill, while Assemblymember David Chiu (D-San Francisco) is the main author.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) is more skeptical because of the high turnover rate of college renters in Isla Vista compared to long-term tenants in other areas of the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Unander, a lawyer who works with the IVTU, said that due to I.V.’s 94.2% occupancy rate, with 98% of occupants being </span><a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0636868-isla-vista-ca/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she believes landlords will choose not to renew rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have more people looking for housing than we have housing available right now,” Unander said. “So this law is not going to benefit anybody in Isla Vista, probably not anybody in Santa Barbara.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [landlords] have a choice between renewing this tenancy at a lower rent increase or do a new tenancy for more money in a community like ours where there is a low vacancy rate, their better investment is going to be to end that existing tenancy and go with a newer tenancy at the higher rent,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that renters living in housing owned by St. George &amp; Associates, a leasing company with property in I.V., have approached her with concerns regarding their landlord’s reaction to the new law. According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates planned to raise rent 12%, on a unit where five tenants live. Due to AB 1482, the leasing company is considering not renewing the lease and instead looking for new tenants they can legally increase the rent on. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. George &amp; Associates did not immediately respond to request for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite I.V.’s low vacancy rates and consistent supply of tenants, however, it’s expensive for landlords to replace their tenants with new ones, according to Klinton Gibbons, property manager for The Hive IV, a leasing company based in Isla Vista.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If anything it’s going to benefit people who decide to move somewhere and decide to stay there the three or four years of their school. If they move around all four years, then they’re not going to be locked into any sort of rent control,” Gibbons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we were to lose income, we would just make it up from people who don’t renew and raise those rents in order to balance that out,” Gibbons added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gibbons added that it usually costs The Hive IV roughly $1,500 to prepare an apartment for a new tenant, which can be spent on cleaning, painting and replacing broken items in the unit.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many legislators and advocates support rent control, UCSB economist Peter Rupert noted that many economists do not have the same conclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much every economist believes that rent control typically works the opposite than what people hope for,” Rupert said, meaning it decreases the supply of housing rather than adding to it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupert added that California should increase the supply of housing, rather than enact rent control, in order to alleviate the housing crisis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other landlords operating in I.V., such as Sierra Property Management, are considering charging their tenants for utilities, which some currently do not have to pay, as a direct response to AB 1482, according to its President Michelle Roberson.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for evictions, most in I.V. happen due to tenants falling behind on rent, according to Undander, which could fall under the law’s “just cause” requirement in order for a landlord to send an eviction notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was written with the intention of alleviating California’s homelessness crisis, as evictions can send more people to the street with nowhere else to go, according to Chiu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our housing crisis is causing instability for renters across our state,” said Wicks in a press release. “AB 1482 provides some much-needed relief, with stronger protections to keep tenants in their homes — by protecting renters from the most egregious of rent increases and unjust evictions.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
