Office of the President, is intended to inform students about the expected campus-level consequences of California Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed $500 million cut to the UC. A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, Presidential Leadership Fellow Hadar Dor and Commissioner for Budget Resources Armando Guerrero will serve as the event’s coordinators.</p>\n<p>Monge-Rodriguez said the forum aims to clear up confusion about the University’s finances and allow opportunities for student participation.</p>\n<p>“Many students see and feel the effects of budget cuts but often don’t understand the source of these cuts or who the key decision-makers are in administering them,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Beyond providing information, we hope to create a space for dialogue where students have the opportunity to counsel UCSB administrators on how to make budgetary decisions in a way that is sensitive to our wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>Campus administrators and faculty members including Executive Vice Chancellor Gene Lucas, Assistant Chancellor Todd Lee, Dean of Undergraduate Education Mary Nisbet and economics professor Henning Bohn will also be present.</p>\n<p>According to Guerrero, the forum will facilitate discussion between campus decision-makers and the student body.</p>\n<p>“A goal that we have is to make the administrators more accessible to the students,” Guerrero said. “We want to try to get the information that circulates among administrators to students.”</p>\n<p>The event will consist of five-minute presentations on budget updates by administrators followed by a Q&amp;A session. According to Dor, the A.S. Office of the President plans to use student input from the forum to develop future budget policies.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to decide ourselves what is important for the student body,” Dor said. “Our role is to find out what the student body wants and then advocate for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/","id":3132,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3131,3130,3129],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio","biography":"Not available","articles":[3132,3152],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Students Reject Bulk of Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The results of the Spring Elections’ Campus Elections Commission ballot were released Friday, establishing one new fee and upholding five reaffirmations.

Representatives deliberated over the most effective areas to make cuts, focusing on honoraria and ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Most of the debate centered on whether finances for the proposed A.S. Isla Vista Annex would come from unallocated funds or the budgets of various A.S. subcommittees that have already donated about $40,000 collectively. Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said requiring further funding from committees would limit their ability to function.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I don’t like taking most of it from committees,” Mayorga said. “They’ve already invested so much in the space and cutting their budget is going to hurt the work they will be doing in the space. The money should come out of unallocated [funds].”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz said funding from committees is a necessary means of determining whether or not the project is viable.</p>\n<p>“This is really a trial run — a chance for us to see if this is something beneficial so if it doesn’t work we can pull out,” Lantz said. “The committees want this to happen and will do everything in their power to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>However, Lantz said students should ultimately determine the project’s fate via a lock-in fee on next year’s Spring Election ballot.</p>\n<p>To absorb requisite cutbacks, Representative-at-Large Chloe Stryker said committee member’s honoraria should constitute a smaller portion of the association’s budget.</p>\n<p>“If you look at our budget, most of our fees are going towards honoraria,” Stryker said. “I don’t think that’s right. Members should be working out of good heart and because they want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>According to Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht, honoraria currently comprises an excessive portion of A.S. finances.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is the most expensive thing we pay for,” Lieberknecht said. “People give to this association to get something back and not just pay for our salaries.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated Finance Board’s request for $23,075 from next year’s unallocated budget, $19,000 of which would go toward the group’s honoraria. Lieberknecht said she feels such a substantial request is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>“You should cut our honoraria,” Lieberknecht said. “Most of the money requested would be going towards honoraria.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually decided to approve $21,600 for the board.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/","id":3130,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3129,3128,3127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Protest Highlights Concerns Over Oil Policies","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students’ Environmental Affairs Board organized a silent walk through campus yesterday to commemorate last year’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill and protest U.S. dependence on foreign oil....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students’ Environmental Affairs Board organized a silent walk through campus yesterday to commemorate last year’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill and protest U.S. dependence on foreign oil.</p>\n<p>The walk began at Davidson Library and continued through the center of campus and Isla Vista’s most populated areas, concluding at the MultiCultural Center. Protesters carried signs imploring British Petroleum and the U.S. government to take responsibility for the crisis and address ongoing environmental concerns about the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>EAB co-chair Teal Riege, a fourth-year ecology and evolution major, said the April 2010 disaster — which killed 11, injured 17 and released an estimated five million barrels of oil into the Gulf — rocked the nation both culturally and ecologically.</p>\n<p>“We were socially, politically and environmentally destroyed after the spill,” Riege said. “We are still recovering, but this protest is to remind us that the government and BP still have not done enough to restore stability in the Gulf.”</p>\n<p>Riege said the protest was organized to highlight our national dependence on the companies that failed to take responsibility for causing the spill.</p>\n<p>“The oil spill devastated … the ocean and the Gulf still hasn’t recovered,” Riege said. “The spill ruined the lives of animals [and] made people have contempt toward BP and oil companies in general even though we’re dependent on them.”</p>\n<p>Protest organizer and EAB member Ally Gialketsis, a third-year history and environmental studies major, said advocating for a change in energy policy at Washington D.C.’s Power Shift protest earlier this month encouraged her to plan Wednesday’ protest.</p>\n<p>“After attending Power Shift, many of the students were talking about having protests on each of our campuses in commemoration of the BP oil spill,” Gialketsis said. “Most of the schools planned their protests at BP gas stations, but we thought we would reach more students through our walk.”</p>\n<p>While protesters carried posters claiming that over 6,000 animals were killed as a result of the spill, EAB member Sierra Moreno, a third-year environmental studies major, said the estimates may not represent the full extent of the destruction.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of cover-up done after the spill,” Moreno said. “Scientists have been speaking up and revealing that there was much more death and damage done than the numbers originally suggested.”</p>\n<p>Riege said they chose to keep the walk silent to express their mourning — rather than anger — about the incident.</p>\n<p>“We are not protesting out of hatred,” Riege said. “This is a peaceful protest.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37328\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/protest-highlights-concerns-oil-policies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37328\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/protest-highlights-concerns-oil-policies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/protest-highlights-concerns-oil-policies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/protest-highlights-concerns-oil-policies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/protest-highlights-concerns-oil-policies/","id":3131,"author":{"id":210,"name":"Tina Petrosian"},"related":[3130,3129,3128],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
