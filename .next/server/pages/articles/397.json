Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson handled the offensive load in that game, scoring 23 and 20 points, respectively.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a series of unfortunate injuries kept Green out for much of his collegiate career, he was finally able to stay healthy last season, playing in all 33 games. His averages of 11.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game earned him an All-Big West Honorable Mention. He figures to be one of the team’s most critical players in his senior year, especially with the departure of UCSB great Alan Williams.</p>\n<p>Alongside Green as one of the team’s two starting guard/forward combo players is Bryson, the only Gaucho who was named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team. With averages of 13.9 points and 4.8 rebounds a game in 2014-15, Bryson was named First Team All-Big West. Unfortunately for UCSB, he will be unavailable for Friday’s game after he was suspended by the NCAA earlier this week for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>With their most proven, consistent scorer out of the lineup, the Gauchos will need to rely on their other role players to provide a scoring punch. That shouldn’t be a problem for reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent. The sophomore had averages of 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game last season and was second on the team in threes with 57, knocking the long ball down at an efficient rate of 41.6 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have huge shoes to fill in the middle with Williams, the program’s all-time leading rebounder and second all-time leading scorer, now playing in the Chinese Basketball Association. However, if Head Coach Bob Williams continues to stick with the starting lineup he used against San Francisco, which included two point guards in Vincent and junior Eric Childress, the former inside-out approach that utilized “Big Al” in the center position may be replaced with a small ball, guard-heavy offensive style.</p>\n<p>Nebraska-Omaha has not played since August, when it went a perfect 4-0 on a tour through Italy, outscoring its foreign opponents by an average margin of 48.5 points per game. In the Summit League Preseason Poll, the Mavericks were picked to finish seventh out of nine teams in the conference this season, with no players being named to the Preseason All-Conference first or second teams.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game will be the first of 10 non-conference games away from home for UCSB. The Gauchos will play only three non-conference home games this season and two games on a neutral site when they face Akron and Iona in Las Vegas over winter break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not played a season opener without Big Al since 2011. Playing without him in 2014-15, the Gauchos went an impressive 5-2, a mark which gives them confidence that they will be able to succeed this season playing without their focal point from the last three years.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s and Nebraska-Omaha’s seasons tip-off at 5 p.m. this Friday at Ralston Arena in Nebraska.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12,

from San Francisco State in its season-opening exhibition last night in the Thunderdome. Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson both hit the 20-point mark as the Gauchos nearly doubled the Gators’ scoring totals in the final 20 minutes on their way to a 66-45 win.</p>\n<p>Green’s impressive stat line also included 12 rebounds and an efficient 9-14 shooting from the field. He was one of three starters to knock down a pair of three-pointers on the night, along with Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>After a slow start for UCSB, which trailed 4-0 several minutes into the game, a three-pointer from Vincent began a 14-0 run for the Gauchos as they took control of the lead for the remainder of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a layup by Green at the 6:35 mark gave Santa Barbara an 18-10 lead, the Gators responded well, going on an 11-4 run to cut the deficit to just one point.

Bryson meanwhile had a solid overall game, shooting 8-17 from the field and picking up six boards, two assists, a steal and a block.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for San Francisco State was forward Floyd Wormley. The senior shot 4-12 from the field to end the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists, all team-highs. As a team, the Gators finished an inefficient 15-59 (25.4 percent) from the field, compared to 25-57 (43.9 percent) for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard T.J. Taylor didn’t score, but was able to impact the game in other ways as he tied Vincent with five assists for the team-lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its regular season opener this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/","id":394,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[393,392,391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Promising Start for Henrickson & UCSB, Nearly Force OT in 70-67 Exhibition Loss vs CSUDH","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Despite its 70-67 exhibition loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday, the UCSB women's basketball team is headed in a progressive direction with new Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson guiding the team.

We did that too much and were kind of sloppy, we just have to be more discipline and fundamental.”</p>\n<p>The Toros were small in the paint and UCSB made sure it dominated. At six feet two inches, Jones capitalized on CSUDH’s lack of size in the front court, posting-up and backing down defenders for quick turnaround layups.</p>\n<p>In order to improve its interior defense, Dominguez Hills switched between a full-court press and 2-3 zone. While Jones periodically scored some baskets down low, the Toros’ defensive adjustment was beneficial. It forced UCSB to shoot from the perimeter, an unsuccessful aspect of the Gauchos’ shot selection. Santa Barbara shot 25 percent from long distance, going 4-of-16 from behind the three.</p>\n<p>“It pushed us out wide,” Henrickson said. “We needed to be able to go downhill and instead of playing it East-West, our zone offense needed to go North-South. It was a zone, but their [Dominguez Hills] ball pressure felt like man.”</p>\n<p>Eventually the “small ball” lineup of Dominguez Hills prevailed, outscoring UCSB 20-12 in the third quarter. With 2:09 left in the period, CSUDH went on an 8-2 run to take a 56-49 lead to head into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Knocking down one of the two three-point field goals during the Toros’ run was senior guard Breanna Garcia. The score was the stimulus to her four consecutive baskets in the fourth quarter’s opening. Her scoring rally helped CSUDH take a 10-point, 65-55 lead with 06:12 left in regulation. Garcia ended with a game-high 24 points on a 10-of-16 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>With 4:58 remaining in the fourth quarter, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe drained a clutch three-pointer to establish the Gauchos’ comeback surge. She registered six points while finishing with a game-high of nine assists, tying her career-high.</p>\n<p>A jumpshot by freshman guard CoCo Miller continued Santa Barbara’s come-from-behind attempt. Despite picking up three early fouls, limiting her to 19 minutes, Miller shot four-of-five for 12 points. The scores helped spark UCSB’s 10-2 run, trimming CSUDH’s lead to 65-67.</p>\n<p>A missed three-point attempt by Toros’ junior guard Imari Brown set UCSB up with its last attempt at either a win or tie.</p>\n<p>As UCSB looked for Jones in the paint for the game-tying bucket, the Toros’ defense forced senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware to settle for a missed three-pointer with 41 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>The missed attempt led to the Gauchos having to intentionally foul, sending Dominguez Hills to the free throw line. A missed free throw by Dominguez Hills’ redshirt junior guard Femi Hamilton kept UCSB within three, down 65-68.</p>\n<p>A timeout helped give Santa Barbara time to draw up a play that freed up Jones in the paint for an easy layup that cut the Toros’ lead to one at 68-67.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB foul placed senior guard Monay Lee at the free throw line as she made both to give Dominguez Hills a 70-67 lead. She finished with 16 points and two steals. The Toros sunk 69.2 percent of their free throws, making 18-of-26.</p>\n<p>With no timeouts and five seconds remaining, it left UCSB with no other option than to go for the game-tying three. Unable to find Jemerigbe, Ware or Miller for the last shot, junior forward Mi’Chael Wright ended up taking the three-point attempt that bounced off the cylinder of the rim and resulted in the Gauchos’ 70-67 loss.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s bench outscored its starting lineup, Henrickson knows that it is going to take more than scoring for the Gauchos to earn victories.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have favorites,” Henrickson said. “At the end of the day, it’s about production. Be a better screener, weak side help, spread the floor, defensive transition, be a better rebounder on both ends of the floor. Most people think it’s about scoring, it’s not. Think about all the ways you can win a game that require no talent. If we buy into that, it’ll just increase our chances to be successful.”</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short, the exhibition loss does not blemish the Gauchos’ overall record as they prepare for their season opener this Friday, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup> at Washington St. at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/","id":395,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[394,393,392],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Make Season Debut on the Road at Washington State, Face Idaho on Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson prepares for her first regular season game with the UCSB women's basketball team this Friday at Washington State.

Certainly, limiting turnovers and improving at the free throw line were areas of focus in this week’s practices.</p>\n<p>“We shot 43 percent, you can beat a lot of people shooting 43 percent. The problem is we didn’t get enough shots,” Henrickson said. “The free throws are a confidence thing and you have to earn your confidence.We’ll get better there but we’ve got to take care of the ball and not turn it over.”</p>\n<p>While it will be Bonnie Henrickson’s official debut as UCSB’s head coach, it will be a rematch between the Gauchos and Cougars. Last season’s meeting resulted in an 81-55 Washington State victory over UCSB in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Despite the lopsided defeat, UCSB trailed by just seven points, 28-35, at halftime. With the losses of former All-Pac-12 guards Lia Galdeira and Tia Presley, both of whom are pursuing professional playing careers overseas, the Washington St. lineup has lost a significant portion of its scoring.</p>\n<p>When combined, Galdeira and Presley averaged 36.7 points and 9.5 rebounds per game and had a total of 172 steals last season. The two scored 45 of the team’s 81 points against UCSB and Galdeira registered a game-high four steals. Apart from the former backcourt, no other WSU player averaged double-digit points per game.</p>\n<p>The Cougars, however, seem to have a solution for the absence of the guards after a 79-37 exhibition win over Lewis-Clark State College this past Sunday. All 14 of the players on WSU’s roster scored, while freshman forward Borislava Hristova recorded a game-high 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting, two-of-three from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB had the size advantage in its exhibition bout versus Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday, but will be challenged by the height of the Cougars. A total of seven players stand 6 feet and taller for WSU, the tallest being sophomore center Bianca Blanaru at 6 feet 5 inches.</p>\n<p>However, after shooting 11-of-12 from the field for 22 points and grabbing a game-high eight rebounds in her collegiate debut for UCSB, it may take more than size to contain freshman forward Kali Jones.</p>\n<p>Her ability to post-up and use her power in the paint along with her soft release when shooting the short jump hook or finishing at the basket with a layup could be the difference in overcoming the Cougars’ tall frame on defense.</p>\n<p>Jones came off the bench in UCSB’s exhibition loss, playing 29 minutes. Due to an ankle injury, Jones did not start in the Gauchos’ preseason game on Sunday but still managed to play and  will be ready to start for Friday’s season opener.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t know until shootaround that morning that she would even play,” Henrickson said. “She hadn’t practice all week because of the ankle. She would have started had she not had the ankle issue because she has been the most productive big.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her play, UCSB’s ability to convert points off turnovers will be pivotal, as the Cougars had trouble handling the ball in their exhibition victory, recording 22 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Another chance at redemption presents itself in UCSB’s visit to the University of Idaho this Sunday.</p>\n<p>Last year’s contest nearly went into overtime, but ended with a UCSB turnover and two makes at the free throw line by former guard and current member of the Perth Lynx, Stacey Barr, who scored a game-high 20 points for the 47-44 Idaho win.</p>\n<p>The Vandals faced Lewis-Clark State College on Friday, routing the Warriors in a 93-58 exhibition victory. Idaho was spot on from three-point distance, draining 41.7 percent on 15-of-36 shooting from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Connie Ballestero led all players in scoring and assists with 17 points and six helpers. She shot four-of-seven from the field, all of her made field goals being three-pointers in which she attempted five from long distance.</p>\n<p>The three ball proved to be the difference in last season’s meeting between the two teams. While Idaho made just 9-of-25 of its attempts from the perimeter, UCSB recorded a 7.1 three-point percentage on 1-of-14 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made 25 percent of their three-point attempts on Sunday. UCSB’s offense does not revolve around perimeter shots but being able to sink some from long distance would definitely be helpful.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos must find a way to defend the three ball and keep the Vandals off the perimeter. While this will be no easy task, Santa Barbara’s mindset suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>“We know the feeling of last year,” senior guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have good intensity and a competitive mindset, just looking at the scouts and knowing the players. Not giving up points in transition and being able to stay down and guard someone one-on-one, that’s the big thing we’re working on.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season opener at Washington St. this Friday, Nov. 13 will tip off at 8:30 p.m. Its game at Idaho on Sunday, Nov. 15 will begin at 2:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-make-season-debut-on-the-road-at-washington-state-face-idaho-on-sunday/","id":396,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[395,394,393],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
