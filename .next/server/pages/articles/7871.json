It is not a byproduct of achieving fame, fortune or a hand in marriage, nor is it freedom from struggle, at least according to Harvard psychiatrist Dr. George Vaillant.</p>\n<p>Vaillant was so intrigued by the secret behind happiness that he sought to find its answer through monitoring contentment levels among 268 students from the Harvard graduating classes of ’42-’44 for more than seven decades in his comprehensive research titled “The Grant Study.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[We] measured them from every conceivable angle and with every available scientific tool,” Vaillant said.</p>\n<p>To measure happiness, Vaillant categorized all possible responses under four varying levels of efficacy. The unhealthiest of responses he referred to as “psychotic adaptations,” which are found in the mentally ill and are characterized by paranoia and hallucination as the unconscious mind’s attempt to “create a reality tolerable for them,” Vaillant said. The next highest up, “immature adaptations” are responses such as passive aggression, projection and acting out. Socially normal people employed “neurotic defenses,” which, according to Vaillant, include “intellectualization, repression and dissociation.”</p>\n<p>The “healthiest adaptations” turned out not to be defenses but abilities to turn undesirable circumstances into beneficial ones. Such strategies were common in “anticipation, humor and altruism.” It’s these qualities that form the foundation of the most rewarding personalities.</p>\n<p>What separated those who viewed themselves as truly happy from those who did not was not in the events that made up their lives — it was in how they responded to those events. The key difference between the happy person and the unhappy one was that one viewed themselves as a victim to their circumstances, while the other sought ways to use it to their advantage. The degree to which happiness was attained was in the adaptations the participants employed to deal with and shape their reality.</p>\n<p>Vaillant also identified “education, stable marriage, not smoking, not abusing alcohol, healthy weight and exercise” as the six major factors that lead to healthy and happy aging.</p>\n<p>According to Vaillant, exercise plays a major role in regulating contentment as we age, important not only physically but mentally as well.</p>\n<p>“Regular exercise in college predicted late-life mental health better than it did physical health,” Vaillant said. “Of the men diagnosed with depression by age 50, more than 70 percent had died or were chronically ill by 63.”</p>\n<p>Yet of all these factors that influence lasting happiness, there was none quite as indispensable as the “power of relationships.” Underlying the foundation of relationships is perhaps the most valuable and most human adaptation: altruism.</p>\n<p>Our desire to advance those around us without the expectation of anything in return provides us with a happiness rooted in unselfish adaptation. It is through altruism that we are enabled to extend our legacy beyond ourselves and make the outcomes of our efforts limitless. Although it requires vulnerability, it also promotes similar altruistic happiness within those you associate with.</p>\n<p>According to Vaillant, contentment arises from taking risks to form deep relationships with others over superficial ones that prevent us from getting hurt.</p>\n<p>“Positive emotions make us more vulnerable than negative ones. One reason is that they are future-oriented. Fear and sadness have immediate payoffs — protecting us from attack or attracting resources at times of distress,” Vaillant said. “Gratitude and joy, over time, will yield better health and deeper connections, but in the short-term actually put us at risk. That’s because while negative emotions tend to be insulating, positive emotions expose us to the common elements of rejection and heartbreak.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51386\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/harvard-happiness-study-analyzes-keys-to-a-lifetime-of-joy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51386\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/harvard-happiness-study-analyzes-keys-to-a-lifetime-of-joy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/harvard-happiness-study-analyzes-keys-to-a-lifetime-of-joy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/harvard-happiness-study-analyzes-keys-to-a-lifetime-of-joy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/harvard-happiness-study-analyzes-keys-to-a-lifetime-of-joy/","id":7871,"author":{"id":1038,"name":"Brandon Shin"},"related":[7870,7869,7868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":1038,"name":"Brandon Shin","biography":null,"articles":[7871],"portrait":null},"related":[{"title":"Costs and Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids","category":"Science & Tech","subcategory":"Health & Wellness","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the past couple of years, omega-3 fatty acids have received profound media attention due to their wide range of health benefits.

Although they serve as a powerful source of nutrition, excess omega-3 fatty acids can come with a cost to overall health.</p>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids, which we must obtain from our diet through foods such as fish oil or some plants and nut oils. The more potent and important omega-3 fatty acids</p>\n<p>are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is only present structurally in minute quantities and is constantly in need of replenishment. DHA, the main building block for brain and retinal development, is more abundant in the body and aids in the formation of neural transmitters.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to Amy Jamieson, MS, PES, AASDN, a nutrition lecturer and faculty of the Department of Exercise and Sport Studies at UCSB, DHA has many other benefits for our bodies also.</p>\n<p>“Health benefits include an increase in HDL — the good cholesterol — and a decrease in LDL — the bad cholesterol — which results in improved blood cholesterol levels and reduced risk of heart disease,” Jamieson said.</p>\n<p>However, David Valentine, a professor of Earth Science and Biology at UCSB, and Raymond Valentine, professor emeritus of Plant Sciences at UC Davis, have discovered that taking omega-3 fatty acids may come with a price. David Valentine focuses largely on the role of omega-3s in cellular membranes, ranging from within human neurons to plants and bacteria, while Raymond Valentine researches how to engineer genes from ocean plants to harvest crop plants for a more accessible source of omega-3. They published a book outlining their findings titled, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and the DHA Principle.</p>\n<p>According to their journal article in Progress in Lipid Research, “omega-3 fatty acids in cellular membranes: a unified concept,” DHA and EPA comprise a large portion of the cellular membrane of bacteria and human cells. DHA and EPA are oxidatively unstable in nature and can be easily broken down into harmful byproducts. In bacteria, oxidation is less likely because most bacteria live in an anaerobic environment. But in humans, this is the opposite. The combination of unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids and oxygen present in our brains causes inevitable oxidation, which could lead to brain aging and disease.</p>\n<p>Jamieson said that these causes and effects of DHA oxidation could pose a risk when deciding whether or not to take a fish oil supplement.</p>\n<p>“Supplements are always controversial — studies show that fish oil supplements can improve cholesterol health and help in reducing risk of heart disease, but high doses can be harmful. Natural sources — food sources — are always a better choice,” Jamieson said.</p>\n<p>It is not advised to completely denounce omega-3 fatty acids, however, excess dosage could cause adverse effects. These fats are very important in increasing our neural development; despite the downside of their oxidation, they have a myriad of health benefits which outweigh the disadvantages.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/costs-and-benefits-of-omega-3-fatty-acids/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/costs-and-benefits-of-omega-3-fatty-acids/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/costs-and-benefits-of-omega-3-fatty-acids/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/costs-and-benefits-of-omega-3-fatty-acids/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/costs-and-benefits-of-omega-3-fatty-acids/","id":7868,"author":{"id":1037,"name":"Sayeh Akhavan"},"related":[7867,7866,7865],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Commonly Abused Drugs – Cocaine","category":"Science & Tech","subcategory":"Health & Wellness","publish_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cocaine.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cocaine.jpg?resize=640%2C317&ssl=1","description":"Although not a new trend, cocaine use has been portrayed in media — from soap operas to trap music — as an increasingly glamorized lifestyle.

Cocaine has had a tumultuous history and continues to be one of the most consumed and demanded drugs to cross U.S. borders. But what is it and why is it so controversial?</p>\n<p>Cocaine is a substance that comes from the <em>erythroxylum coca </em>plant that grows in South America. The leaves have been used since the 17th century for medicinal purposes and many workers still chew it today to alleviate hunger pains and elevation sickness. To turn the coca leaf into the powdery substance most of us recognize, the leaves undergo a multistep chemical process. The coca leaves are soaked in gasoline and other chemicals including ammonia and sulfuric acid, filtered and heated to produce the powder or crystal form of cocaine hydrochloride. The cocaine is then distributed, most often via drug cartels, to countries all over the world. According to Business Insider, almost all of the world’s cocaine supply is made in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia. Obtaining pure cocaine, however, is not guaranteed. Some of these chemicals include caffeine, designer drugs and meth.</p>\n<p>“It is very, very, very, <em>very</em> rare that you get cocaine pure, so students are unaware often what they’re taking and that’s what causes a lot of risk and problems, because cocaine is often cut with many, many harmful chemicals,” Lacey Johnson, counselor and educator for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program, said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the consumer level, how does cocaine affect the brain once in the body? Cocaine can be administered in several ways: absorption through nasal tissue (snorted), diluted into water and injected or — if the crystal substance is obtained — smoked. Once in the body, cocaine takes over the part of the central nervous system that is responsible for rewarding us with the feel good chemical, dopamine, released when we do things such as eat, drink or have sex. Normally, dopamine crosses gaps between nerves and receptors at regulated levels and then returns to the original nerve cell to be reused later. Cocaine increases dopamine levels by 400 to 800 percent above normal levels. It also blocks the dopamine from returning to the nerve cells that released it, so dopamine builds up very quickly, giving users a feeling of euphoria, happiness and alertness.</p>\n<p>While the high of cocaine feels really good, it does not last very long. Cynthia Kuhn, author of <em>Buzzed: The Straight Facts About the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy,</em> writes, “liver and blood enzymes degrade about half of a cocaine dose in about an hour. This means that a user is usually ready for another dose in about forty minutes or less.”</p>\n<p>“After people do coke, usually people felt so, so good that now that the [reward-pleasure pathway] factory has depleted what it has so people will feel depressed and irritable because there’s nothing there to help you,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>On its own, cocaine has many risks, including damage to brain cells, seizures, constricted arteries, vascular disease, damage to the nose and risk of addiction. Heavy users are susceptible to strokes, brain bleeds and memory and thought deficits. When alcohol is added to the mix, as it often is, a whole new compound is created that has more adverse effects. Alcohol and cocaine create a highly toxic chemical in the liver called cocaethylene that increases the likelihood of an early heart attack or sudden death. In addition, cocaine masks the effect of alcohol, which leads to higher BACs.</p>\n<p>“People will be drinking and feel really drunk, and then they’ll do a line and think ‘Oh, I don’t feel as drunk anymore, I can have another beer,’” Johnson said. “Really, they’re just as drunk — nothing has changed in their blood, but they don’t feel as drunk so they tend to drink more and their BACs climb. Also, mixing alcohol and cocaine speeds up the metabolism, so alcohol reaches the brain faster.”</p>\n<p>The drug is often part of the “work hard, play hard” mentality that is popular among many college campuses. According to a study done at School of Public Health in Maryland, 13 percent of students had used cocaine by their fourth year in college. Programs like UCSB’s Drug and Alcohol Program aim to decrease harm and increase safety.</p>\n<p>“We want to help students make healthy and safe choices,” Johnson said. “We help students weigh out their risks with the understanding that students are adults and they have to make their own decisions. We want to make sure students know every risk that is involved.”</p>\n<p>For more information on drug or alcohol use and services offered by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, visit their website: <em>alcohol.sa.ucsb.edu</em> or call (805) 893 – 5013.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 23 of the Thursday, Oct. 29 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/commonly-abused-drugs-cocaine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/commonly-abused-drugs-cocaine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/commonly-abused-drugs-cocaine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/commonly-abused-drugs-cocaine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/commonly-abused-drugs-cocaine/","id":7869,"author":{"id":1036,"name":"Erendira Garcia"},"related":[7868,7867,7866],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yoga: More Than a Trend","category":"Science & Tech","subcategory":"Health & Wellness","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"You are in your biweekly evening yoga class.

Some traditionally recognized benefits of yoga are that it improves concentration and creates self-awareness.”</p>\n<p>Yoga heavily impacts the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which are part of the autonomic nervous system. ANS regulates daily bodily processes, such as urination, digestion, salivation and sexual arousal. The ANS controls the fight-or-flight response, an automatic reaction to a harmful effect on the body and maintains homeostasis.</p>\n<p>Manoj Joshi, Founder and Director of Wellness By All Means, said that yoga uses body channels as sources of energy. Ida Nadi is associated with left nostril breathing, while Pingala Nadi is associated with the right.</p>\n<p>“Yoga mentions Nadis, subtle channels of prana or life force or vitality. The Ida Nadi and Pingala Nadis are associated with the left side and right side of our sympathetic nervous system [respectively],” Joshi said. “With the balanced breathing techniques it is possible to bring balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and activate the central nervous system. This creates a state of homeostasis or state of equanimity and a balanced state of mind.”</p>\n<p>When you activate the PSNS and SNS, your brain and body feel the effects. Slow, deep movements, holding poses and deep breaths benefit the PSNS to overall reduce stress in the body. During PSNS activation, the mind and body are relaxed; you become aware of stress-inducing thoughts and respond to them better. On the other hand, vigorous exercises, such as sun salutations or deeper stretches, activate the SNS. Yoga that incorporates stretches and breathing techniques to first activate the SNS and then the PSNS is the best for a more well-rounded and balanced practice.</p>\n<p>Yoga increases blood flow to the organs essential for survival and helps to remove toxins. When the body is cleansed the neurons and other cells function better.</p>\n<p>The American Heart Association and Mayo Clinic say that practicing yoga can reduce or even treat the effects of cardiovascular disease. The American Medical Association suggests that it could help with carpal tunnel syndrome, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine are investigating its affects on lower back pain, multiple sclerosis, insomnia and other chronic diseases.</p>\n<p>So, next time you are in savasana and practicing your mindul breathing, think about peace replacing the stress and hectic years that have injured your body. Live the yoga lifestyle to achieve utmost health and well-being.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Wednesday, January 29, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/yoga-more-than-a-trend/","id":7870,"author":{"id":1035,"name":"Priyanka Shindgikar"},"related":[7869,7868,7867],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
