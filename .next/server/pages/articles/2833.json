This is the first time he dedicated a full lecture time slot to the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Within the nationwide college undergraduate student body, approximately “23.1 percent of females and 5.4 percent of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a>.</p>\n<p>Before Spickard began Thursday’s lecture, he told students they were permitted to leave if they were uncomfortable with the sensitive material. About a dozen women and six men left.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Spickard included examples of perpetrators of sexual violence throughout history, a study of the degree of repentance within rapists’ language and a testimony by a victim.</p>\n<p>Spickard discussed historical sexual assault perpetrators such as the Roman Army in Rome, Kitty Schmidt’s brothel in Germany and Boko Haram in Nigeria. Each presentation slide showed an image of the victims.</p>\n<p>Before he read a victim’s testimony, Spickard warned the class about the subject matter. As he read, some students left in tears.</p>\n<p>“This lecture was hard because I knew I was saying something that would make some people in class uncomfortable because they had a terrible experience,” Spickard said. “I wanted to be as careful as I could be not to add to that.”</p>\n<p>He said he had a conversation with a student who expressed that men are not the only perpetrators of sexual violence. Spickard explained that he focused on men because it is more common for men to be perpetrators.</p>\n<p>According to a 2010 survey on sexual violence by the Center for Disease Control, female rape victims reported that 98 percent of perpetrators of sexual violence were male.</p>\n<p>Approximately 93 percent of male rape victims reported only male perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Spickard said he wanted to educate his students about sexual assault and how it is a part of many people’s lives, but also to confront possible perpetrators with a message they have been ignoring.</p>\n<p>“When I look out the doors of I.V. Theatre, I am reminded of where I am and what happens outside those doors,” he said. “If I’m in this community and a hurtful thing like this keeps happening, then I need to stand on the side of doing something about it.”</p>\n<p>“It is just not okay,” he said repeatedly. “It has to stop.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the May 3, 2018 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She was very strong and would stand up for her opinions about things and so that was something I hugely appreciated from writers.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s friend and fourth-year economics and accounting major Vivian Hu, who met Stone as a freshman Chi Delta Theta pledge, described Stone as frequently being “very positive” and as someone who was friends with students across the entire Greek community.</p>\n<p>“She loved everyone so fiercely. She would go above and beyond for anyone. She would do you any favor, do anything to make you feel better,” Hu said. “She’s probably the only person I can say never had a bad thing to say about anyone else.”</p>\n<p>According to Hu, Stone was selfless in her friendships with others.</p>\n<p>“She would make sure everyone else is okay before she would think of herself,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Lalita’s former roommate and global studies alumna Elaine Yoo said Stone had a passion for music and had a rich, eclectic musical taste.</p>\n<p>“Every morning when we would wake up we’d listen to a lot of The Strokes,” Yoo said. “She also liked playing the accordion and listening to classical music … [junior year] she was really into Calvin Harris and that’s kind of how it started where she wanted to attend more EDM shows and write about it.”</p>\n<p>Yoo said Stone was planning out her first novel before she passed away.</p>\n<p>“She was actually in the process of trying to write a novel … she had a list that she was making like a plan for herself,” Yoo said. “That was something she was aspiring to do.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s parents will hold a memorial service for her Tuesday, March 10, beginning at 4 p.m. in Loma Pelona Center, Room 1108, near San Rafael Residence Hall and Manzanita Village.

Over time, fans of baseball have come to expect a certain something when the fall classic hits. I am talking about each team’s Mr. October. Sometimes he varies per series, sometimes he is consistent throughout the entire playoffs, but he is always there. Often a come-from-nowhere type guy, each team’s Mr. October seems to hit his stride just in time to lift his team, his fans, and his city to championship fervor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cody Ross is that such player for the Giants. Dismissed with the wave of a hand by the lowly Florida Marlins, the Giants are his fifth major league team in seven years. However, he seems to like where he landed, as his stats in the 2010 postseason show that he’ll be an honorary NorCal bro until the end. In seven games, he has four homeruns, seven RBI, eight hits, a .350 hitting percentage, and a .435 on base percentage. Whenever Ross steps up to the plate, he is as sure to get on or around the basesas Lindsay Lohan is to wind up in jail again.</p>\n<p>And Ross isn’t hitting off Grandma Jo over there. No, sir. He is hitting home runs off of such pitching legends as the Phillies’ two Roy’s, Halladay and Oswalt. Just a mere four hours ago, he drove in a run off of pitching ace Cole Hamels, the one-time boy wonder. Ross has not only outperformed both his competition and teammates, but he is straight up trumping the usual heavy-hitters. Ryan Howard, the Philly bomber, has registered zero HR’s in the playoffs. Jimmy Rollins, always a consistent hitter, has  four RBI’s and three hits, but only a .286 on base percentage. Ross’ teammate, Aubrey Huff, known for his RBI prowess over the past season, has only one RBI thus far, with a .217 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Who knows how long Ross will be boss of the Bay? Maybe he’s simply best kept secret in this perfect bubble of the playoffs, separate from any other time in the long, enduring baseball season. Or maybe he’ll ignite into a late-blooming Hall of Famer. Whichever it is, for this moment, in this postseason, Ross rules.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/speace-mind-ross-giants-october/","id":2831,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2830,2829,2828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Party Upsets Campus United’s Stronghold on A.S.","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7149.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7149.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Campus United remains dominant in the A.S.

Across the previous two years, Campus United (CU) had won seven of the eight available partisan executive seats.</p>\n<p>Campus United remains dominant in the A.S. Senate, after students elected 14 Campus United candidates and 10 from IVP.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Election Board, 8,233 undergraduate students, or 39.7 percent, voted in the election. This is the highest voter turnout since 2014.</p>\n<p>Students voted against the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NewCen renovation project</a> with an 81.69 percent no vote. The project had drawn widespread controversy across A.S. and on social media, largely due to the project’s costs.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited and thrilled that the students had the opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue,” said Hieu Le, current A.S. president and one of the project’s primary supporters. “We need to listen to what the students have to say in terms of supporting a different funding model for it, and that’s something that I stand by.”</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel was elected as the next A.S president and is the lone executive candidate elected from CU.</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, the Isla Vista Party’s candidate for president, said he is undeterred by the loss.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as tough a loss as I think a lot of people think it was,” he said. “People really showed up for us. We had a lot of votes in every category; I’m super proud of all the effort everyone’s put in. It was never about me, and it never will be about me.”</p>\n<p>Dumlao also said he will continue to make change on campus and said he believes the election has encouraged more students from all backgrounds to get involved at the university.</p>\n<p>“For all the unrepresented students out there, for all the queer students, for all the brown students, for all the Pacific Islanders, there’s a spot for you out there,” he said. “Last quarter, the quarter before that, every quarter I’ve been here, I always think I don’t belong here at UCSB. And this race has really shown me that we do belong here.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho with IVP won the internal vice president position against CU’s Anthony Pimentel by 636 raw votes. Ho is currently an on-campus senator in A.S. senate. Ho and Pimentel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico of CU and off-campus senator lost to IVP’s Jeike Meijer by nearly 600 raw votes for external vice president of local affairs. Meijer has said she will be the first Native American to serve as a UCSB A.S. executive. Dycaico and Meijer declined to comment.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Mayela Morales won the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) position against Madeline Loudon of CU. Both candidates declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson lost the vote for student advocate general (S.A.G.) against Grecia Martinez. Ettleson told the Nexus she was not “afraid of any candidate winning” because she believes everyone is competent and qualified.</p>\n<p>“I’m ecstatic about the whole executive slate because every single one is going to do such amazing things. I’m obviously disappointed; I think Grecia will be a great student advocate general,” Ettleson said.</p>\n<p>“I am relieved, ecstatic — it’s been a very long two weeks,” Martinez said after the win. She said she was excited to work with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum, to analyze statistics behind the election results to see where the students fall on campus issues.</p>\n<p>At a somber post-election meeting, CU party leaders urged those who fell short of elected seats to remain hopeful and active.</p>\n<p>“When I look at all of you here, as a fourth-year exec, you know what I see? I see the future of this fucking campus!” Kristin Hsu, the current EVPSA, told the party. “This is not Associated Students United, this is Campus United!”</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in there — fuck that!” she added.</p>\n<p>Kopel thanked the CU staffers for their help in her victory and echoed Hsu in telling the party to not give up their fight.</p>\n<p>“Campus United needs to stay united,” she said. “No matter what happens in there, we are the people who are best for this campus … We will come back again, and we will sweep again and again and again, no matter how long it takes.”</p>\n<p>A photo story from the night can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/in-photos-a-s-elections-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence, Sanya Kamidi and Jose Ochoa contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Hsu said “Associated Students United,” not “Soviet Students Union” as previously reported.
