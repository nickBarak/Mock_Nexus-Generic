The woman replied that she lived in the Santa Rosa Residence Hall, then corrected herself, saying she lived at the Pi Beta Phi sorority house.</p>\n<p>The officer noticed that the woman reeked of alcohol and could not maintain her balance, so he arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the deputy placed the woman under arrest, she whispered, “If you un-arrest me, I will give you $10,000.”</p>\n<p>Because bribery is frowned upon by the police force, the woman’s offer was rejected, and she was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Age-Blinded By Love<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:15 a.m. – Deputies walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to a group of five people standing in a parking lot drinking beer.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as a man, who was holding a can of Steel Reserve 211, hand the drink to a woman, who knocked the beer back.</p>\n<p>A deputy approached the woman, removed her from the crowd, and began questioning her. The woman said she was 17, but later admitted that she was only 16. The officer issued her a minor in possession citation, and let her go.</p>\n<p>The officer then turned his attention to the man and asked him how old he was. The man said he was 23 years old.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man why he gave the woman alcohol, to which the man replied, “Because this is I.V.”</p>\n<p>After the subject admitted that the woman did not look 21 years old, the officer asked him why he would provide her with alcohol outside, in front of patrolling deputies.</p>\n<p>The man eloquently replied, “She asked me for a drink, and I was like, OK.”</p>\n<p>When the officer informed the man that the woman was 16, he stupidly responded, “That’s bad.”</p>\n<p>It got worse when the police officer cited the man for furnishing alcohol to a minor, which incurs a minimum fine of $250.</p>\n<p>Who Got Pinocchio Drunk?<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:34 a.m. – While patrolling at the corner of Camino del Sur and Trigo Road, Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers observed a woman walking northbound down the street.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old woman was staggering all over the road, unable to keep her balance, when she saw the group of deputies. She then turned around and stumbled back the way she came.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the woman and asked her if she was all right because she showed signs of intoxication, including the strong smell of a fruity alcohol.</p>\n<p>The subject told the officer that she was “OK” and said she was just walking with her boyfriend. The deputy, who knew the woman was lying, said he had just witnessed the woman walking alone, and reminded her that lying to a peace officer is against the law.</p>\n<p>The officer began collecting the woman’s information, and asked for her age. She told him she was 19 years old, but said her birthday was September 12, 1986, making her 20.</p>\n<p>The deputy dutifully corrected the woman on her age as he arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Squared Plus B Squared Equals More Than Drunk<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:21 a.m. – Officers were called to a university-affiliated housing complex on the 6500 block of El Colegio Road, where one of the building’s resident assistants was detaining a 20-year-old man for harassment.</p>\n<p>The subject was allegedly yelling derogatory comments at a woman when the RA called 911.</p>\n<p>A deputy attempted to question the subject, but the man was so incoherent he could only manage to call the officer “Dude,” repeatedly.</p>\n<p>The man did not know where he was and denied the reports of harassment, but admitted to having “more than five beers but less than 10.” He also confessed to smoking marijuana for the first time.</p>\n<p>Honest Abe said no more, and the deputy arrested him for public intoxication. The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The 6’4” forward picked up 2 fouls in the first quarter, and was forced to sit the entirety of the second quarter to avoid picking up her third foul. Lane actually finished the half scoreless, and without production from Lane, the UCSB offense sputtered to a measly 18 points in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into the game, much was made of the ‘Chos’ potential advantage on the glass against an Irvine team that struggles to rebound. Despite being outrebounded by almost 6 boards per game this season, UCI actually grabbed 2 more rebounds in the first half than UCSB. Unsurprisingly, the Gauchos trailed Irvine by 5 at the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSB’s starters struggling for much of the night, the Gauchos needed some sort of spark off the bench to come back against the upstart Anteaters. That spark actually came in the form of two players: junior forward Mira Shulman and senior guard Tal Sahar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third quarter, with UCSB down by 12 points, Shulman hit 2 key 3-pointers off the bench en-route to an 8-point quarter for the walk-on. In total, Shulman would finish with 10 crucial points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> her first double-digit performance of the season. At the end of the third quarter, the Gauchos were able to pull the deficit to only 5 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fourth quarter, Sahar showed off her range, hitting both of her 3-pointer attempts. Sahar would finish the game with 14 points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the second highest output on the team. The UCSB bench scored 28 points, accounting for nearly half of the team’s total score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After not playing in the second quarter and not scoring in the first half, Lane provided UCSB with one of the most dominant fourth quarters in recent memory. Lane would finish the quarter with a resounding 17 points and 6 rebounds, absolutely bullying the Anteater interior defense and showing off why she averages a double-double. Perhaps most impressively, Lane accomplished the feat on only 7 field goals in the quarter, and only turned the ball over once despite her high usage in the post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind Lane’s theatrics, UCSB went from a 5-point deficit to a 6-point lead with 3:27 left in the quarter. In addition, UCSB dominated on the boards in the second half; after being outrebounded in the first half, the Gauchos outrebounded the Anteaters by 20 in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the impressive fourth quarter comeback, the Gauchos now move to 2-1in the conference </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good for fourth place in the Big West.

Junior outfielder Kristen Clark will be sure to come out strong in this weekend’s tournament, as she has a .459 batting average with eight runs scored thus far.</p>\n<p>Alongside her will be freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer, who has already made a name for herself leading the Gauchos in virtually all offensive categories. Hitting at an incredible clip of .467, she has knocked in 10 RBIs and has scored six runs so far in this season. Although only a freshman, Altmeyer has a pretty good feel for her team.</p>\n<p>“If everyone’s on the same page and connecting on the field or in the dugout, then our day rolls pretty well,” Altmeyer said.</p>\n<p>The pitching staff, who as a team is sporting a 5.47 ERA, will need to use the remainder of the week to prepare. Especially starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow, who is carrying a solid ERA of 2.23, as she will have to face South Carolina first with a lineup featuring four players batting at least .400.</p>\n<p>“Obviously when playing a top team you get a little excited to prove yourself, but I prepare myself the same way against any team,” Ludlow said. “Pitching is mostly mental for me, so it’s all about being in the right mind set.”</p>\n<p>When facing the 9-1 Gamecocks, Ludlow will have to pay special attention to their biggest threat: senior outfielder Alaynie Page. Page set five South Carolina single-season records in the last year, including 15 home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gamecocks’ junior pitcher Jessica Elliott will have an intimidating presence on the mound as she carries a stellar 0.98 ERA into the Classic. Gaucho top hitters Clark and Altmeyer will surely be tested when facing Elliott’s efficient pitching.</p>\n<p>Georgia Tech may pose an easier game for the Gauchos as it enters this tournament not having won a single game. Despite the Yellow Jackets’ six-game losing streak, an upset victory could be the startingpoint to a possible turnaround. Although the Gauchos are favored to win, they cannot take any game lightly.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Jackets’ biggest threat to the Gauchos will be junior outfielder Samantha Pierannunzi. She leads Georgia Tech in a majority of the team’s offensive categories, batting .278 with five runs scored this year.</p>\n<p>The Southern Utah Thunderbirds come into the tournament with a 3-9 overall record. They have lost their last three games and are struggling through the early stages of the season. They are led by junior catcher Morgan Leonard, who is hitting .387 on the season with three home runs and 10 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Jordan Theurer also is a key contributor for Southern Utah at the plate, with a .455 batting average and six runs scored. However, the primary problem for the Thunderbirds is their pitching, as they have a team ERA of 8.96.</p>\n<p>The tournament’s opening game will take place this Friday, Feb. 26 at 8:30 a.m. as the Gauchos take on the South Carolina Gamecocks, then face Georgia Tech at 10:30 a.m. The two-game series with both teams will continue on Saturday, Feb. 27 with UCSB taking on South Carolina again at 8:30 a.m. and the Yellow Jackets in the afternoon at 1 p.m. The Gaucho Classic I will conclude Sunday, Feb. 28 with UCSB’s matchup versus Southern Utah set to take place at 11:15 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-hosting-gaucho-classic-i/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-hosting-gaucho-classic-i/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-hosting-gaucho-classic-i/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-hosting-gaucho-classic-i/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-hosting-gaucho-classic-i/","id":59,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[58,57,56],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Impresses in Gaucho Classic I, Possess Current Two-Game Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsSouthCarolina-20160227-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsSouthCarolina-20160227-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite entering the Gaucho Classic I with an overall record of 4-6, the UCSB softball team performed great at home in its home opening series  with a 4-1 finish to the weekend.

With 2 outs and 2 runners on-base, senior second baseman Arianna Palomares lined a single to right field knocking in two runs.</p>\n<p>After a walk of sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston loaded the bases, freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer was also walked to bring in the Gauchos’ third run of the inning. Third baseman Emily Brucelas then singled up the middle to knock in Palomares for the game winner.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Palomares went 2-4 with two RBI’s and a run scored in the game. Left fielder Kristen Clark contributed with two hits and a run scored. Gaucho starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched 5.2 innings, giving up six hits and three earned runs. Reliever Claudia Puente picked up the win with 1.1 innings of solid relief.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s matchup against the Gamecocks, the Gauchos suffered a tough defeat, losing 6-1.  In the game, South Carolina scored early and often, recording five runs in the first two innings.</p>\n<p>Gamecock freshman outfielder Kennedy Clark led the way with a home run, three RBI’s and a run scored. Junior starting pitcher Jessica Elliot pitched a complete game to earn her seventh win of the season against no defeats. The Gauchos had eight hits in the game but were unable to string them together for runs.</p>\n<p>In its second game on Saturday against Georgia Tech, Gaucho starter Ashley Ludlow threw a complete game no-hitter to lead the Gauchos to a 4-0 victory, striking out 11 and walking 2 to pick up her second win of the season. It was the first no-hitter in Ludlow’s stellar collegiate career, and came at a time when her team needed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s not always about whether you’re physically prepared, but whether you’re mentally prepared. You have to treat each game the same and just focus on your job and what you have to do. That’s how I came out today” said Ludlow.</p>\n<p>Trying to recover from the tough loss against South Carolina earlier in the day, the Gauchos started fast with a quick run in the first inning. Clark led off with a single.</p>\n<p>After Yellow Jacket starting pitcher Jenna Goodrich loaded the bases with a pair of walks, UCSB junior outfielder Jaqueline Hinojosa brought home Clark with a solid single The Gauchos went on to score another run in the second and two more in the fourth.</p>\n<p>The first game against Georgia Tech on Friday was another comeback win for UCSB. The Gauchos found themselves down early partly due to two self-inflicted errors. Down 3-0 in the third, the Gauchos abruptly turned things around by scoring two runs on four straight singles to trim their deficit to 3-2.</p>\n<p>It remained a one run game until the sixth inning when the Gauchos pulled ahead for the victory. UCSB scored two more runs in the inning, sparked by a Jessica Johnston RBI single into center field scoring freshman infielder Melanie Menor.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished its weekend with a solid 10-2 win over Southern Utah on Sunday afternoon led by rightfielder Jessica Johnston’s outstanding day at the plate going 4-4 with three RBI’s and three runs scored.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the Thunderbird’s weak pitching, the Gauchos scored 4 in the first inning highlighted by Johnston’s clutch single which sent home Clark and Palomares for the first 2 runs. The Gauchos ended the game in the 6th under the mercy-rule when Jessica Tetzlaff singled in Hinojosain to score the final run .</p>\n<p>The powerful arm of freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin proved too much for the Thunderbirds on Sunday, as she took the win with a six inning complete game effort. Gulvin allowed just two runs on five hits, while tying her season best with six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of better hitters at the college level, so I need to focus more and work harder towards hitting those right spots. But altogether, our offense as a whole is looking like we are off to a good start,” said Gulvin.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played well at home this weekend, having a successful tournament picking up four wins against just one loss, highlighted by Ashley Ludlow’s first career no-hitter on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to keep its momentum going into next week as the Gauchos will travel to Northridge to play in the Stacy Winseberg Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/ucsb-impresses-in-gaucho-classic-i-possess-current-two-game-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/ucsb-impresses-in-gaucho-classic-i-possess-current-two-game-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/ucsb-impresses-in-gaucho-classic-i-possess-current-two-game-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/ucsb-impresses-in-gaucho-classic-i-possess-current-two-game-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/ucsb-impresses-in-gaucho-classic-i-possess-current-two-game-streak/","id":60,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[59,58,57],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
