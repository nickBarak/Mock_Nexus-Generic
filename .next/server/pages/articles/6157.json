This was the latest in a series of meetings held over the past few years between University of California, Santa Barbara administration and various campus constituencies concerning the UC budget cuts. During that meeting, Lucas effectively said, “It is not ‘us’ (the UC system, or UCSB, for that matter), it is ‘them’ (the California State Legislature).” While this may have some validity — indeed, there have been massive cuts from the state to the UC system for years, or really decades now — in all likelihood, the state legislature will turn around and claim, “Well, it is not our fault, it is the federal government’s fault.” In turn, the feds will assert, “It is not our fault either, it is the global economic system’s fault,” or, better yet, “It is China’s fault.”</p>\n<p>In April 1970, on the very first Earth Day — held partially in response to the infamous oil spill that occurred one year earlier, right here in Santa Barbara — the late comic strip artist Walt Kelly declared in Pogo, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Lucas would have us believe that the “enemy” is the California State Legislature, which it is, but this narrative absolves the UC system and UCSB from any culpability regarding this current mess that we’re in. It is not just their fault, it is the UC’s fault too. But let’s take a step back here, for a moment. Is it only the state legislature’s responsibility? Don’t they have less money because the federal government has cut back funding too? I would say yes, but why don’t they have sufficient funds and resources anymore? Why are the feds so “poor?”</p>\n<p>On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City, one year before he was assassinated, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered one of his most impassioned, militant and, sadly, often-overlooked speeches, titled, “A Time to Break Silence.” In that talk, King sharply and eloquently observed that one of the primary reasons why people of color in first and third world countries were rising up and demanding change was that their basic needs were not being met. He boldly stated that the United States is “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,” and people’s needs were not being met because the U.S. was engaged in a “senseless, unjust war,” as he said in his “Drum Major Instinct” sermon, delivered on February 4, 1968.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With our “peace-loving” country currently in three wars that we know about, don’t these words ring true today more than ever? With a Pentagon budget that surpasses the military budgets of all countries in the world combined, don’t these words ring true today? With the United States having more prisoners in the world than any other nation, don’t these words ring true?</p>\n<p>To quote Marcellus from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “There is something rotten in the state of Denmark,” but what smells isn’t just UCSB, the UC system or the California State Legislature (or our good old friend Jerry Brown, who the seminal punk band the Dead Kennedys mocked in the late 1970s) — it is militarism, imperialism and, dare I say, the capitalist system we all live in. Every day we passively participate in this system. I do too. I buy into consumerism and turn a blind eye while suffering takes place; this passivity makes me the enemy, too.</p>\n<p>I thus agree with Pogo — we have met the enemy and he is us, but in saying this, let’s not forget that a larger enemy is out there. In the ’60s, they called it the “system.” In the ’90s, people raged against the machine in Chiapas, in Los Angeles and in South Korea. Even here, at UCSB, nine students staged a nine-day water-only hunger strike in April 1994 to push for lower student fees, a community center for low-income families in Isla Vista, and more outreach programs to recruit and retain Latina and Latino students from the surrounding three counties (Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo). They also pushed to ban table grapes from campus, maintain El Centro and strengthen and expand the Chicana and Chicano Studies Dept.</p>\n<p>That effort was not entirely successful, but it did bring about change — without it, this campus would look much different than it does today, meaning the campus did increase its efforts to recruit students of color. Without it, the Chicana and Chicano Studies Dept. would have no Ph.D. program. Without it, teens in Isla Vista would not have a space to “kick back and relax,” which they can do at the I.V. Teen Center. Change took place. Many years ago, Frederick Douglass said, “Power never concedes nothing without a demand, it never did and it never will.”</p>\n<p>We know who the enemies are and how we can defeat or challenge them. In his Riverside speech against the Vietnam War, King called for a revolution in values and, most provocatively, “love.” King believed in the power of love; not sentimental, romantic love, but love in action — that is, organizing a multi-racial coalition of poor people, as he hoped to do before he was killed, to ameliorate poverty and suffering in the United States. Love in action can mean many different things; for folk-singer Woody Guthrie it meant displaying the words “this machine kills fascists” on the side of his guitar. For the Good Samaritan — based on the biblical story from Luke in the New Testament — it meant not fleeing in haste as the priest and Levite did, but getting his hands dirty, helping the “man” who had been beaten and left for dead, tending to his wounds and then taking him to an inn where he returned and paid for his room and board. What did love in action look like recently?</p>\n<p>It looked like 20 people marching through campus demanding that the abstract thing we call “budget cuts” stop because they are hurting people — workers are overworked and stressed out and some have become literally sick as a result of changes such as “clustering,” which is a fancy term for increasing one’s job responsibilities without any pay increase or eliminating one’s job altogether.</p>\n<p>These cuts are literally “cutting” people up — they are barely hanging on and that is really no way to live, is it? Most of us are hanging on by a thread and we are happy to be working and living in our own homes (which many people do not, as witnessed by the foreclosure mess and staggeringly high levels of homelessness), but we all have our breaking points. How much longer can this go on until we see a massive uprising — a progressive or radical one, at that — here in the United States?</p>\n<p>In his Riverside speech, King quoted former President John F. Kennedy, who famously stated, “Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible, make violent revolutions inevitable.” I hope and, yes, pray, that this doesn’t come to pass. I abhor violence, but something must change and change soon. In 1964, Sam Cooke sang about a “long change that is gonna come.” Well, it has come, but so much more needs to be done. When will it happen? When will we stand up? When will we “rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful struggle for a new world,” as King said? When will it be?</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval is a professor in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

After turning my first assignment in late and still being hired for some reason, the first thing I did was go up to my then-editor, Audrey Bachelder, and ask her for dibs on reviewing “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Go ahead, she said. I did it twice: one fake review for April Fools — thus technically making me the first person on the planet to write a review for “The Force Awakens” — and a real one that nobody read because they were too busy watching the actual thing.</p>\n<p>I spent a year and two months in fervent anticipation of seeing that movie and getting to write my review of it, hot off the heels of a one-year-stint as the Entertainment Editor of the <em>Pony Express </em>at Pioneer High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>“But Alex,” you might say, “I don’t give a flying fuck about your nostalgic pre-graduation reminiscing. Is the movie any good or not?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And, faithful reader with the colorful sentence-enhancers, I would say no sir. No, it is not. It looks good. It sounds good. It’s not a train wreck by any means.</p>\n<p>The thing is, these kinds of train wrecks are actually fun to watch.</p>\n<p>I am actually surprised by how much I didn’t care about what was going in “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” With prequel movies — especially those bearing the burden of the “Star Wars” brand — that’s to be expected, especially when you know where certain characters are going to end up at some point. But even with the new characters, played by actors of great repute like Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelson, I was disappointed by how this movie spectacularly failed in making me care about them.</p>\n<p>In case you’re one of the unfortunate plentitude who had no idea this was even out, “Solo” is how Han got his start in the criminal underworld, although it’s not quite as focused on revealing how he became the roguish Harrison Ford-figure than it is on showing us how he got his gear. Alden Ehrenreich plays Han with enough charm to keep me from falling asleep. Same goes for rest of the cast — yes, even Donald Glover. They all do well enough to get by without leaving that much of an impression.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the only standout character I found myself getting invested in was L3, Lando’s co-pilot and further proof that Lucasfilm is better at creating more captivating droid characters than human ones. She’s a first in the new Star Wars canon, a droid who aspires to see her kind self-actualize and stop serving the whims of organic beings. That idea could carry a whole movie by itself, but here it’s little more than a character quirk that serves to the benefit of someone else’s story.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s a story that I could not give less of a crap about if I tried. Writers Kasdan and Kasdan take events already explained in the old canon — like Han’s time in the Imperial army, his meeting Chewbacca, the Kessel Run, obtaining the Millenium Falcon — and compress it all into a heist film about nabbing valuable fuel. The major problem here is that since this is yet another prequel, we know where Han, Chewie and Lando end up, so not only are there pretty much no stakes to be had, it’s also very difficult to get invested in their development.</p>\n<p>But there’s hardly any of that, either. For a long time via interviews, I’ve heard about how this movie explains how Han Solo became such a cynical smuggler, but we don’t see that. Instead, we’re treated to a movie that essentially serves as a shopping list: blaster? Check. Falcon? Check. Dice that were apparently in ”A New Hope” and were important for some reason in ”The Last Jedi?” Checkmate.</p>\n<p>There aren’t any decent villains for Han to play off of, either. Dryden Vos (played by Paul Bettany, Vision from the “Avengers” movies) looks cool, but he’s barely around. Enfys Nest — no, there’s no apostrophe in there — looks cool, sounds cool, fights like a badass, and then all that mystique and danger that surrounds the character evaporates in a second when the film reveals that they’re actually supposed to be a good guy. Dammit, “Solo!” Quit disappointing me!</p>\n<p>And then comes the part that baffles me. The film’s best scene, which doesn’t happen until after the climax and was the only part that got me genuinely excited, will probably confuse you unless you’ve watched “Clone Wars” or “Rebels<em>.</em>” As much as I appreciate the fan-service/sequel-bait, what’s the karking point if every entertainment outlet on the Internet has to write articles explaining it to the general moviegoer?</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve seen worse. And as per usual, I’m probably making it sound a lot worse than it probably is. But at the end of the day, outside of two fun scenes, abhorrent pacing, dull new characters and just-serviceable old ones and a distinct lack of anything new or fun bog “Solo” down and send it plummeting into a black hole of mediocrity to join the likes of Episodes I-III.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung’s still going to see the rest of them, though.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-01/solo-stalls-mid-hyperspace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-01/solo-stalls-mid-hyperspace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-01/solo-stalls-mid-hyperspace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-01/solo-stalls-mid-hyperspace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-01/solo-stalls-mid-hyperspace/","id":6154,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6153,6152,6151],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Candidate Contests Election Endorsement Art","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My name is Nicole Leopardo and I am African American, Swedish, Italian, French, Native American and Chinese.

First, the image did not look like me. Second, this image is not representative of my multiracial identity, and actually distorts my image in such a way that delegitimizes it. By depicting me as this darker image, it denies my multiraciality, and instead, emphasizes a monoracial identity that simply seeks to construct me as black. These notions reflect racist notions, such as the “one-drop rule,” in which a person is designated as black if they have any amount of African ancestry. Third, this image shows complete disrespect for how I identify as an individual.</p>\n<p>I am tired of society at large telling me and other multiracial individuals how to identify.

A portion of a student’s courses are predetermined due to his or her specific major or general education requirements, but what about the remainder, which must be hand-picked from an orchard of options? There are a number of elements that might influence students during this decision process, such as friends, counselors, advisors, intriguing one-sentence course summaries in the class catalog, websites or booklets with professor reviews, a weakness for dinosaurs, etc. The matter to ponder is whether those resources are consistently helping students select classes that will benefit them in a significant and enduring way, because it’d be nice if our young scholars were getting constant value from their college enrollment outside of their Rec Cen membership.</p>\n<p>There is, however, one source of valuable data that isn’t readily available to students when they’re deciding between classes for an upcoming quarter: the data from the course and teacher evaluations that students fill out at the end of a course. At present it’s unclear what impact these evaluations have on the teaching strategies of college professors. What is clear is that this source of collective student wisdom is not made directly available to students by the university, and that if the aggregate scores of course evaluations were published for every class in the online course catalog, professors would pay a lot more attention to them than they presently do.</p>\n<p>Regarding the usefulness of the evaluations themselves, there seems to be an opportunity to improve their ability to generate information that will be of use to students and faculty alike. For example, current evaluations contain questions such as, “To what extent were course goals clearly presented?” and “To what extent were course goals achieved?” While it’s important for professors to state the course goals and achieve them, these questions don’t address whether those goals actually benefited the students. Using the above questions as a standard of evaluation, a professor could state and achieve the goal of putting half the class to sleep in every lecture and still receive top marks from student reviewers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So is there a way to improve the course evaluation system? Yes, there is. Here are my proposed new categories by which to judge the merits of a college course:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inspirational Potency – Does the class motivate you to improve your behavior, or spark a new interest in something, or reveal exciting opportunities that you weren’t previously aware of?</p>\n<p>Engagement of Attention– Are you genuinely interested and intrigued by what is taking place in class to the point that you’re actually compelled to ask questions and contribute to discussions?</p>\n<p>Intellectual Stimulation – Does the class put you in challenging situations where you’re forced to display work ethic and ingenuity as well as expand your capabilities?</p>\n<p>Skill Development – Did you develop specific abilities you didn’t have before the class that you’ll be able to make use of once the class is over?</p>\n<p>Joy Level – Did you have fun in the class, and were you happy while you were there?</p>\n<p>Memorability – Can you truly see yourself remembering this course four years from now?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There it is: a new course evaluation metric. Rate each category on a scale from 1-10, put comments on the back of the paper and that’s that. Then school administrators can publish the average scores for each category for every course-professor combination on GOLD, and, suddenly, students can find classes worth more than just four extra units.</p>\n<p>Connor Hastings is a graduate student of environmental studies and management.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41202\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/system-abolish-blind-selection/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41202\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/system-abolish-blind-selection/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/system-abolish-blind-selection/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/system-abolish-blind-selection/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/system-abolish-blind-selection/","id":6156,"author":{"id":538,"name":"Connor Hastings"},"related":[6155,6154,6153],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
