Of the 68 departments, 65 are positive or at budget.</p>\n<p>The county executive office (CEO) and auditor-controller presented a report of the third quarter of the fiscal year at Tuesday’s board of supervisors meeting, revealing that the Sheriff’s Office is projected to reach a deficit of $1.4 million by the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Despite what might seem to be a daunting figure, the county is projected to end the fiscal year with a net increase of $750,000 in their general fund.</p>\n<p>SBSO’s deficit is an example of some of the fiscal challenges the county is facing this year. The county is expected to reach an approximate $35 million deficit if it continues to operate at this level of expenditure and has been re-balancing its budget for the next fiscal year to prevent funding issues.</p>\n<p>Following budget workshops with the county Board of Supervisors in April, the CEO is expected to release its proposed budget for the next fiscal year next Thursday. The Board of Supervisors will then hold its budget hearings on June 12, during which the public is welcome to comment on the final budget. If necessary, the hearings will continue on June 14 and 16.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate any potential budget issues, county officials have proposed 5 percent budget cuts across all departments.</p>\n<p>SBSO is facing a possible reduction of nine full-time positions in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), though Undersheriff Bernard Melekian has spoken to the board in favor of keeping the positions during last month’s budget workshop meetings.</p>\n<p>According to documents outlining the proposed cuts’ fiscal impact, reductions to the IVFP alone would bring approximately $1.9 million to the county’s general fund. These reductions would include removing three sergeants, two special duty deputies and four deputies, as well as reducing overtime pay.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, Isla Vista is the only station in the county that is not operating “at minimum staffing,” meaning there will likely be cuts in this area to balance the department’s finances.</p>\n<p>“As a result, we proposed a significant reduction in our staffing levels at the IVFP. We are in discussions with the CEO’s Office and University representatives, and at this point nothing has been decided as of yet,” Hoover said in an email.</p>\n<p>IVFP is not the only section of SBSO that would see cuts. The proposed cuts for SBSO in the next fiscal year total approximately $7.6 million.</p>\n<p>While these cuts were proposed at the budget workshops in April, none of the reductions have been finalized. They will go through public hearings before they are adopted.</p>\n<p>Each county department’s presentation during last month’s budget workshops included a section for departments to request a restoration or expansion of programs slated to be cut.</p>\n<p>In Melekian’s presentation, he said IVFP is a “critical” part of SBSO’s budget priorities but acknowledged that the department is facing issues when it comes to staffing, updating technology and funding.</p>\n<p>Melekian said the department’s equipment is outdated. The department is working on updating their computerized dispatch system as well as their jail management system — which will be operational in November — but he said the records management system remains out of date.</p>\n<p>According to Melekian, SBSO also needs new portable radios and car systems. The department does not proactively replace equipment but rather rushes to gather funding when old equipment fails to function.</p>\n<p>In addition to outdated technology, SBSO currently has 49 total vacancies in its stations, causing employees to work overtime. As a result, SBSO has had massive overtime expenses totaling $6.4 million for this fiscal year, offset partially by $5.4 million in salaries and benefits savings, according to a board letter from Tuesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the letter from the board of supervisors, “Further exacerbating the vacancy issue, an additional 17 patrol deputies and 12 custody deputies were on worker’s compensation leave, who not only continue to draw salary, but also create vacancies that are often covered with overtime.”</p>\n<p>The board anticipates that if the department ends the year with negative net financial impact, it will need to use the general fund to balance its deficit.</p>\n<p>“This assumption has already been factored into the projected year-end net positive variance of $750 thousand in the general fund,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The county will make their final decisions regarding the budget in June.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77957\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77957\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/","id":4406,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4405,4404,4403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[2286,2364,2385,2391,2392,2400,2404,2416,2419,2421,2424,2425,2429,2430,2443,3574,3584,3601,3737,3749,3756,3757,3763,3786,3801,3806,3908,3910,3920,3925,3926,3952,4280,4291,4313,4352,4357,4386,4387,4388,4389,4392,4393,4394,4395,4403,4404,4406,4408,4409,4423,4426,4435,4442,4449,4465,4489,7780],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Unfazed by the Haze: Greek Life Confronts its Reputation","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Greek-Life-Nexus-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Greek-Life-Nexus-file-photo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara has seen three fraternities lose their charter or colony status since 2014 for hazing-related offenses.

New fraternities are now dealing with the repercussions. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The last three closures paint an unfavorable portrait of Greek life at UCSB, but three new fraternities have sprouted up in Isla Vista with an emphasis on preventing sexual harassment, hazing and alcohol hospitalizations.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma attained charter status in Spring 2015, as did Sigma Chi in Jan. 2017. Phi Delta Theta received colony status in 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the three fraternities’ presidents, none have violated policies from the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Office of Student Life (OSL) or their national headquarters.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi president and third-year environmental science major Ryan Kelly said his organization has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault and hazing.</p>\n<p>“As sexual assault and stuff like that is very prominent today, you hear a lot about that, not only in general, but with Greek communities,” Kelly said. “So that’s something we definitely were aware of and wanted to change specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Kelly said his organization will kick brothers out of parties if the women attending feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>\n<p>“What it comes down to is how the girl sees it. If she feels uncomfortable; if she thinks something is happening … We really ultimately have to trust the girl’s word, because we don’t want that to be perceived as us making this acceptable,” Kelly said.</p>\n<p>Kelly said there would be consequences for brothers if this occurred, beginning with being removed from a party. In extreme circumstances, the brother could be removed from the fraternity and sent to the university to face additional punishment.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma president Adam Elomari and Phi Delta Theta president Christian Munson said their organizations have similar policies and do not tolerate sexual harassment or hazing in any way.</p>\n<p>Though several fraternities have aimed to improve safety policies, the Office of Student Life has issued IFC three warnings, three probations, one suspension and one closure for violation of OSL policies since 2015, according to an email from Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the OSL.</p>\n<p>These numbers do not include informal conversations about fraternities’ behavior between OSL and the fraternities’ officers.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said in the email multiple organizations have been charged with hazing since 2015, including campus organizations, fraternities, sororities and athletic teams. More than one organization is currently under investigation for hazing, he said in the email.</p>\n<p>According to the associate dean, the university’s current policies on hazing have changed but their central meaning has not.</p>\n<p>“Hazing simply should not be tolerated in any organization,” Ashlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Hazing is defined by OSL as any method of initiation likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm or “personal degradation or disgrace” that may lead to physical or mental harm.</p>\n<p>Hazing is currently considered a policy violation even if it does not actually cause harm. Any behavior that is likely to cause harm can qualify as hazing.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said his office is currently working with officers of several organizations to inform them of university policies.</p>\n<p>OSL currently requires fraternities to attend five workshops every year educating them on multiple subjects ranging from sexual violence, hazing, drug use, mental health and diversity awareness.</p>\n<p>Kelly said he has found these workshops useful, and his fraternity’s members gather to see how they can apply the workshops to their organization after they attend the meetings.</p>\n<p>Munson said the workshops do a good job of discussing the subjects, but he would prefer if they wore more interactive.</p>\n<p>“Maybe make it more interactive in a way so there’s not as many people who are not paying attention,” Munson said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/","id":4403,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4402,4401,4400],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVRPD Accepts $13,000 Donation from UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD voted 4-0, with Director Charles Lopez absent, in favor of a resolution to accept the funds on Thursday.
