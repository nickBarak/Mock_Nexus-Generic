On Saturday night, the Gauchos flipped the script with a comeback victory of their own over Cal State Northridge in five sets.</p>\n<p>It was an intense weekend of road volleyball for the Santa Barbara side, who snapped a three-game losing streak with the win over the Matadors. The Gauchos are now 12-9 overall and tied for fourth place at 5-5 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB had the Beach on their back foot to start things off on Friday night. Star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was her usual dynamic self with 13 kills in those two sets, providing the closing three points in the Gauchos’ 25-20 opening-set win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The attack was humming for UCSB early, particularly in that first set. The Gauchos hit at a .300 clip with an efficient 14 kills on only 30 attacks, before dropping to a .179 in the second set.</p>\n<p>That decline didn’t keep the Gauchos from securing the first two sets, but the Beach turned things around in the third set with a fairly commanding 25-20 victory. Playing with their backs against the wall, Long Beach State jumped out to a big lead early and never let up.</p>\n<p>The last two sets, on the other hand, were much more contested affairs.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit .389 as a team in the fourth set, but that wasn’t enough to best Long Beach State’s .424 clip as the hosts won the last three points to snag a 26-24 win. The fifth set was much lighter on offensive firepower but still packed plenty of drama, with the Beach pulling out another extra point victory 19-17 to secure the match.</p>\n<p>Ruddins led all attackers with 31 kills and was one dig shy of a double-double. She had help on the attack from Rowan Ennis (14 kills, .294 hitting percentage) and Torre Glasker (13 kills, 14 digs), both of whom have developed into consistent secondary options on the attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Olivia Lovenberg, as always, kept the UCSB attack flowing with 58 assists, and just missed out on her own double-double with nine digs. The freshman added two service aces as well for a respectable three-and-a-half total points.</p>\n<p>Friday’s loss pushed the UCSB losing streak to three games, the longest such slide the team has had all year. Another road game on Saturday night presented a tough turnaround for the Gauchos, even if the Matadors, now at 6-15 and 2-7 in the conference, are one of the Big West’s weaker teams.</p>\n<p>Even still, UCSB came close to losing their fourth straight on Saturday. CSUN secured a 25-19 win in the first and then outbattled the Gauchos to pick up the third set, which put themselves on the brink of their third victory in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came storming right back, however, hitting .270 in the fourth set en route to a 25-19 victory of their own. Just like on Friday night, set five went to extra points, but this time UCSB managed to pull it out with a 20-18 win.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, Glasker, and Ennis once again paced the Gaucho offense, with Ruddins and Glasker both posting double-doubles as well. Emilia Petrarchi led all players with 22 digs, but it was Nicole Omwanghe and her 7 total blocks that really stood out on the defensive end for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>It was a solid UCSB team performance on defense, as the Matadors were able to muster a hitting percentage of just .172. That was enough for the attack to win a very back-and-forth match to snap the slide and keep the Gauchos in a tie for fourth place in the Big West with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to avenge a painful loss a couple of weeks ago to Hawaii when the Gauchos fly halfway across the Pacific Ocean to take on the Rainbow Warriors next Saturday night at 10:00 PT.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/","id":5560,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5559,5558,5557],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault","biography":"Not available","articles":[11,39,40,146,167,173,205,236,306,308,309,317,765,767,825,947,951,973,1000,1187,1188,1189,1190,1192,1194,1224,1226,1364,1897,1906,3349,3358,3418,3419,3421,3422,4835,4838,4839,4851,4859,4863,4865,4867,4871,4886,4935,4953,4955,4956,4957,4958,4959,4960,4961,4962,4966,4967,4972,4973,4974,4975,4976,4977,4979,4980,4983,4985,4986,4990,4992,5004,5005,5006,5008,5009,5560,5565,5569,5572,5573,5577,5578],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 12 Gauchos Swim The Distance But Fall Short Against No. 15 LBSU on Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It took six thrilling overtime periods to decide a winner.

LBSU improves to 16-10 overall (3-1 conference) with their seventh win in their last nine games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the first period, Long Beach State was ahead 2-0 after netting two open counter attack goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos continued their attacking struggles in the second quarter as senior utility Taylor Shore’s goal was the only goal for the home side at the break. The 49ers had a 4-1 lead at the end of the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB found their groove in the action-packed second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third quarter, freshman utility Abbey Grosse’s goal started a three-goal run for the hosts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A minute and a half after Grosse’s goal, senior utility Jenna Solberg got past her defender on the wing with a strong move before rifling the ball to the near post past the 49er goalkeeper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forty-five seconds later, Shore stole the ball near mid-pool and took it all the way for a breakaway goal to tie the game at 4-4 heading into the fourth quarter.This gave Shore her second goal of the game and number 42 for the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into this game, UCSB was 11-1 in games in which the team captain scored more than one goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter as Santa Barbara was running out of time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until the 2:41 mark when sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser scored on the well-executed power play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still needing one goal to tie it with 50 seconds remaining, freshman utility Sarah Snyder couldn’t capitalize on an open one-on-one with the Long Beach goalie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, it looked like the Gauchos would only have one more chance to tie it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Kay, the reigning Big West Coach of the Year, called a timeout with under 15 seconds left to put something together to try to extend the game to overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ensuing play, the ball came to sophomore utility Kate Pipkin who was being pressured by a 49er defender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the time winding down, Pipkin lobbed the ball to the far top corner, hitting the post and just crossing the line for the goal with only three seconds remaining in regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The jam-packed fan section let out a thunderous roar as the game was heading into overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really nice sized crowd with good fans, friends and family support,” Kay said. “That got our energy rolling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos kept the momentum going as they were first to score in overtime. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two Long Beach exclusions, UCSB was granted with a 6-on-4 opportunity. After a patient attacking sequence, freshman utility Kate Coski found an opening and scored to give the Gauchos their first lead of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second overtime period, freshman goalie Kenzi Snyder came through with one of her 13 huge saves in this game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the period with 19 seconds remaining and the shot clock turned off, UCSB could have held the ball for the victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pipkin attempted a shot on goal for what looked like a mental lapse from the sophomore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State returned the favor with a last-second goal of their own after the shot deflected off a Gaucho’s fingertips and redirected into the back of the net to bring the game to sudden death overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early in the first sudden death overtime, the 49ers were on the counter attack for what appeared to be a sure goal from a one-on-one with the keeper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A magnificent save from goalie Snyder in goal kept the game alive for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Kenzi Snyder’s] definitely the backbone of our defense,” Kay said. “I’m fired up about how she played, communicated to the team and kept her composure.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar moment in the second sudden death overtime period, goalie Snyder saved the game once again with a huge save for the Gauchos in another one-on-one situation with the odds against her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third period of sudden death overtime went by, and there was still no winner. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into the fourth sudden death overtime period and 10th total period of the game, the intensity was still there from both sides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suddenly, at the 1:58 mark of the period, Long Beach scored with a powerful shot to give them the victory by a final tally of 8-7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large home crowd was stunned as the seniors were defeated in their final game at Campus Pool. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with these tough losses, the Gauchos continue to battle and put up a fight in each game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the game, Coach Kay’s message to the team was about taking advantage of the opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s anybody’s game on any day,” Kay said. “Going into the next two weeks, I think that’s important for everybody to remember.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will wrap up the regular season at Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Following an Anteater service error, the Gauchos put up three back to back kills and managed to bring it within two before falling just short.</p>\n<p>The following set then featured a victorious performance by Santa Barbara as the tables had turned and Irvine was in catch up mode for most of it. Ultimately, another closely battled set resulted in the 1-1 tie on the night.</p>\n<p>Concerning the first half of play, head coach Rick McLaughlin was very happy with the teams’ effort.</p>\n<p>“It was a battle; the first four games were all 23-25,” McLaughlin said. “Either way, when we were down, our guys just played hard in the end and just did a good job.”</p>\n<p>The third set of the night was perhaps the closest of the entire match as either side’s advantage was never greater than 3 throughout it all. Regardless, UCSB fell late once more and the visitors were up again.</p>\n<p>At this point, things were looking bleak for the good guys. However, the service errors and defensive mistakes started to accumulate for the visitors. Naturally, the Gauchos took advantage of this and another 25-23 performance win was just enough to complete the comeback and earn a fifth set.</p>\n<p>The fifth set truly was a nail bitter as plenty was on the line for the hosts. The fans were chanting, momentum seemed to boom from the Gauchos, and it seemed almost like the perfect way to end the home closer: on a high note.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the final set had the Gauchos leading, but always by only a couple scores. The score was soon 10-9, advantage UCI, and no one was certain exactly what way it would go.</p>\n<p>Then came another three back to back scores for the home side and UCSB now looked fully in control. A pair of timeouts and two visiting service errors later, and the Gauchos had done it: an impressive finish against all odds.</p>\n<p>“[Assistant Coach] Cullen Irons had a pretty good read on what he thought they were going to set, and he was on the mark every time,” McLaughlin said. “So we were able to make a plan for blocking, and our servers put great pressure on them. We’ll see what we can improve for the next game…and it’s sure to be another battle.”</p>\n<p>After such an intense match, not only is the coach on edge but also the players.</p>\n<p>“We have a team where pretty much any guy can come in and put up points…There was a lot of momentum, especially in those last three sets,” sophomore middle blocker Brandon Hopper said. “It was really nice to have the crowd, always great to have that…it gets everybody fired up, and we’re starting to get an energy going for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will now head down south the UCI for their final matchup of the regular season. It all starts this Saturday, April 14<sup>th</sup>, on the road at 7 PM.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/no-12-ucsb-completes-5-set-comeback-upsets-no-3-uci-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/no-12-ucsb-completes-5-set-comeback-upsets-no-3-uci-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/no-12-ucsb-completes-5-set-comeback-upsets-no-3-uci-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/no-12-ucsb-completes-5-set-comeback-upsets-no-3-uci-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/no-12-ucsb-completes-5-set-comeback-upsets-no-3-uci-at-home/","id":5558,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[5557,5556,5555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women’s Volleyball Aims To Defy Expectations","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-08-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff Writer Jake Ciccone analyzes the improvements that the Women's Volleyball team has made over the off-season, and how they could lead to a change of fortune for the Gauchos this year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_83893\" style=\"width: 932px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"42925173\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83890\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83893\" data-attachment-id=\"83893\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/charlie-robinson-swings-at-a-quick-set-sicheng-wang-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charlie Robinson swings at a quick set.

UCSB’s five leaders in kills from last season were all underclassmen, and thus they are all returning as veterans in 2018.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of these five is star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who led the NCAA with 5.84 kills per set in 2017 and plans on returning to form again this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Also returning are the Gauchos’ leaders in assists from last year, senior setters Annie Hasselmann and Lexi Rottman, who will benefit from another year of growth with a similar team. For a team that struggled at times last season to put everything together and compete, the return of most of the main contributors is important to having a comeback season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many key players will be returning to the floor again in 2018, Head Coach Lantagne Welch has also added more depth to the Gaucho roster by way of six freshman recruits and one transfer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These Gaucho newcomers will certainly benefit from playing alongside the experience of the eight upperclassmen on the team, but they will also be asked to contribute a significant amount in their first year due to the upside and talent of these accomplished freshmen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the Gauchos’ weaknesses in years past has been their overall depth, and opposing teams were able to exploit that over the course of a match. However, with so many experienced veterans and new pieces, the previous lack of depth should no longer be a weakness, but rather a strength that will benefit Lantagne Welch’s squad this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Last season was difficult for the Gauchos, as they got off to a rough start and were only able to win one non-conference game in the early stages of the season. They managed to pick things up during conference play and put together a solid 7-9 record against Big West opponents.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The team will certainly expect more consistent play throughout the season with a more experienced and talented team this time around.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There is a lot of optimism going into this season with many interesting new pieces and returning stars; however, this does mean that expectations will be higher for the Gauchos and Coach Lantagne Welch.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB women’s volleyball has not had a winning record in the Big West since the 2013 season, during which they went 13-3, won a share of the conference title and secured an NCAA tournament berth.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the expectations might not be that high for this year, improvement is expected, and the team knows this, so they will definitely come out of the gate motivated to show that this year is different.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Gauchos begin their season on Friday, Aug. 24, with a match against the Cincinnati Bearcats, during which they hope to get their season started off on the right note.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/","id":5559,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[5558,5557,5556],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
