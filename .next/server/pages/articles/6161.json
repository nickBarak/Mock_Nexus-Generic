It means “suffering,” according to the Blue Scholars of Seattle. And yes, I am suffering, to be perfectly honest. I feel like many among me are too, so I have the will to describe it.</p>\n<p>Living in Isla Vista, CA shouldn’t be so hard, right? Correct. Men, you should be getting laid every single weekend with any single girl of your choosing. You should be going to parties pre-gamed and pumped, you should be ready to swoop on any bitch that is dancing in her daze. Right? Of course. Pussy is pussy. And good-looking pussy is good-looking. That is Santa Barbara; that is our culture.</p>\n<p>You’re right. You’re absolutely right. Here we are, swimming. But it’s funny, I often find myself swimming against the current — like salmon, yo. Fortunately, this isn’t a fish thing. This is just a person; not rehearsing. And when I’m not rehearsing or putting on a mask to go out, I’m real. If it means I’m mean, irritable, rude or unpleasant, then so be it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let me be real for a minute. Look, I hate I.V. Being the strong word that it is — “hate” — I use it with caution. But I’m using it. Yes, I do hate Isla Vista and everything it usually stands for and represents. Drunk, arrogant fools walk the streets in hordes, groups and masses to do the same thing: clone each other. It’s the truth, what can I say? Every single time I go out to pick up some single girl with another full, single beer in my hand, I think, “What am I doing right now?”</p>\n<p>Well, obviously I’m trying to satisfy my body — my dick, to be more exact. Then, I think, “How important is my dick to me?”</p>\n<p>Well, it’s pretty fucking important, frankly. There’s no denying that. But then I think, “Is your mind stronger than that? Are you more than just a clone?”</p>\n<p>I respond, “Yes.” Yes, it is. My mind is stronger, and I proceed to go practically flaccid. More than a clone? Yup, I’m a bit more than that too, to tell you the truth. Then I become insecure, out of place and outnumbered. Where am I?</p>\n<p>You’re at a party, kid. And this is college, where men stand around a keg and spit the same lines and stories on weekends. You’re in college, where the easiest picking is on the dance floor; capitalize. You’re in a place where “bros” come before “hoes,” where you must say the stupidest shit to make a girl giggle enough until she feels comfortable to kiss you. Then you’re home free.</p>\n<p>These are the motions, and we all go through them regularly. Women buy this, take it home to cook, clean and fuck — more “fuck” than “cook” and “clean” — and then move on to the next weekend, the next party and the next man.</p>\n<p>“Yeeeah, buddy.” That’s where I am. Take a number and get in line.</p>\n<p>“Get me out!” I consider. “Show me someone real!” Yet, there actually isn’t an out, and there is no real. Not until you’re faded, angry and browned-out enough to walk home on your own do you realize, “I hate myself and everyone around me for this. They’re fakes and phonies that don’t deserve my attention or time. This façade I’m living isn’t living at all.”</p>\n<p>Then you realize you sound like Holden Caulfield; you realize the year is 2011.</p>\n<p>You think, “Shit, maybe I think too much. Maybe I overanalyze and criticize behavior too much,” so you chill out. You become cold and indifferent to the people and world around you. Whether at work, school or parties, you’re frosty and apathetic.</p>\n<p>“When this place has something worth showing me, I’ll pay attention,” you think. Maybe an angel will come along one day and grace you with their presence; that’s what you’ll hope for at least — an angel.</p>\n<p>But in the world of Isla Vista you’re unlikely to find her. I suppose there are plenty of angels, sure, but they’re almost all afraid and insecure like you. So much so that you’re likely to never know her.</p>\n<p>So, now what?</p>\n<p>You continue being sagaba: cold and indifferent to the world. You stay jaded and faded in the hopes that you’ll find her; in the hopes that you can find love among chaos.</p>\n<p>You might, but you might not. That’s sagaba, baby. That’s the life.</p>\n<p>Fabian Garcia is a second-year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/","id":6161,"author":{"id":552,"name":"Fabian Garcia"},"related":[6160,6159,6158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":552,"name":"Fabian Garcia","biography":"Not available","articles":[6161],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Thank You, UCSB, for the Beach, the Parties and … the Classes?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Of course, I’m not going on exchange to go to class,” I would nonchalantly announce to anyone who would ask me what I was hoping to do on exchange at UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Of course, I’m not going on exchange to go to class,” I would nonchalantly announce to anyone who would ask me what I was hoping to do on exchange at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Before I came here on exchange, I remember listening in awe to a student from my home university in Australia.

And not just softcore porn. We watched porn involving people with sex changes (it involves a manual pump — that’s all I’m saying); amputee porn, obese porn, geriatric porn, you-name-it-we-saw-it porn.</p>\n<p>Not only did Film Studies 150PG expose me to a whole world that would have otherwise, most likely, remained undiscovered for the rest of my life, but it also challenged my underlying assumptions more than any class I’ve ever taken. I guess that’s what happens when porn stars are guest lecturers in your class every other week.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I would meet UCSB students who were taking classes where topping a group project meant you got an immediate ‘A’ and didn’t have to take the final. Or a hands-on film studies class where filling up the whole theatre would bump you up one whole grade. Or classes where your weekly requirement was to consume delicious Middle Eastern food or grow your own small-scale garden. Don’t even get me started on sailing, water aerobics and racquetball!</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I would take classes that would touch me so personally. As an Australian of Chinese descent, I am so grateful that I stumbled across ethnic studies classes and I am so envious that some people create whole majors out of them!</p>\n<p>As far as I know, ethnic studies doesn’t exist in Australian universities, which is bizarre considering almost 50 percent of Australians were either born overseas or had one or both parents born overseas. For the first time in my life, I was provided with safe spaces to explore deeply vulnerable and important parts of who I am.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I would be delighted even by the classes my home university required me to take here. My teachers for both my compulsory and optional classes were refreshingly generous. They truly engaged with us in class, during office hours and even out of class. I had professors and teaching assistants who took me to coffee and lunch and even hosted end of quarter parties at their homes.</p>\n<p>In a few weeks, when school in Australia starts up again, I’ll be sharing all sorts of exchange anecdotes and tips to the uninitiated at my university — students about to go on exchange at UCSB. I’ll tell them about the fun they’ll have living in Isla Vista (maybe even at one of the extraordinary housing cooperatives), the beauty of the beach and mountains, the spectacle of DP, the terror of the bike paths, the possibilities of travel and the amazing friends they’ll make.</p>\n<p>And I’ll also be sure to tell them to go to class. It might just be an unexpected highlight of their exchange.</p>\n<p>Sue-Lin Wong is an Asian studies major and former UCSB exchange student from Australia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40647\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-07-12/ucsb-beach-parties-classes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40647\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-07-12/ucsb-beach-parties-classes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-07-12/ucsb-beach-parties-classes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-07-12/ucsb-beach-parties-classes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-07-12/ucsb-beach-parties-classes/","id":6158,"author":{"id":550,"name":"Sue-Lin Wong"},"related":[6157,6156,6155],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Governmental Taxation Undermines Its Own Aims","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Massachusetts senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren made big waves this week with a statement she gave regarding government services, taxation and the social contract.

But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”</p>\n<p>Warren correctly points out that people who operate businesses rely on the government to provide certain services, but I believe her assertion about an individual’s obligation to pay more in taxes is based on a narrow worldview that makes too many incorrect assumptions about the disposition and abilities of our government.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first thing we need to do when we talk about paying our fair share of taxes is to take off  Warren’s rose-tinted glasses and examine both the positive and negative things the government does with our tax money. Yes, Warren loves to tell us about how the government uses our income to fund education and infrastructure, but she conveniently forgets to mention that last year the government spent $663.7 billion (18.74 percent of the 2010 federal budget) of our taxes on the Department of Defense so we could operate 737 military installations across the globe and continue funding the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan for the seventh and ninth respective years. Similarly, the government continues to spend our tax dollars on the war on drugs, which it has been losing since 1971. Currently, the government spends billions of our tax dollars on the Environmental Protection Agency in an attempt to curb pollution, and then spends billions more to subsidize the oil industry that causes so much pollution in the first place.<br>\nThe message to take away from all this is that for every nice thing the government does with our tax dollars, it also does quite a few not-so-nice things. Yes, the government builds classrooms for kids, but it also builds holding cells in Guantanamo Bay. Yes, the government spends our tax dollars to police the streets and keep us safe, but the government also spends our tax dollars on the TSA so we can be groped for the sake of security while waiting in line at the airport. Yes, the federal government built the interstate highway system in the middle of the last century, but it also sent thousands of Japanese-Americans to internment camps. The next time Warren tells you it’s your societal obligation to pay your taxes forward, think long and hard about where your money will actually end up.</p>\n<p>But for the sake of argument, let’s pretend the government only spends our tax money on nice things like schools, roads and firefighters. All too often, we forget to ask ourselves if the government is actually any good at doing these things, and, if so, at what cost?</p>\n<p>Let’s talk education. It’s no secret that America’s public school system is not up to speed. It’s also no secret that America’s private schools largely outperform our public schools run by the government. Many say that this is because the public schools are under-funded and would perform much better if only they had deeper pockets, but a quick thought experiment quickly clears up this misconception. Imagine you had the choice of sending your hypothetical child to either a public school or a private school, on the condition that each school had the same amount of money to spend educating your child. Dollar for dollar, the private school always wins because the people who run the private school have a vested interest in doing their job well. In the private school, providing a top-notch education means more profits, whereas in the public school — where revenue is not dependent on the quality of the services rendered — it just means more work.</p>\n<p>Just as private schools outperform public schools, privately owned toll roads outperform pothole-ridden public roads because of the profit motive. Similarly, government operated police and fire units are easily replaced by volunteer organizations. In fact, volunteer fire departments have a special place in American history: Benjamin Franklin himself helped organize one of America’s first volunteer fire departments in Philadelphia. Volunteer police also exist in America in the form of neighborhood watch groups, the only cost of which is the time donated by their participants. (Yes, there are many important details as to how a volunteer police force would function, but that is in itself an article for another day.)</p>\n<p>As Warren’s words continue to reverberate in the media, we must remember that, at the end of the day, her goal is to get elected to the senate. And if that goal requires her to paint a fanciful picture of a competent, well-meaning government, it’s simply one more reason not to trust her — or anyone involved with the government, for that matter — with our hard-earned tax dollars.</p>\n<p><em>Dennis Wassem is a third-year economics major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41356\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41356\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/","id":6159,"author":{"id":553,"name":"Dennis Wassem"},"related":[6158,6157,6156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor’s Logic Concludes With Contradictions","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While watching my laundry make endless revolutions through the front glass window of the washing machine and having nothing more important to do, I picked up the Wednesday, June 22, 2011, edition of t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While watching my laundry make endless revolutions through the front glass window of the washing machine and having nothing more important to do, I picked up the Wednesday, June 22, 2011, edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Rather quickly, I reached the last page.

With the United States having more prisoners in the world than any other nation, don’t these words ring true?”</p>\n<p>Just as an aside, it has been my understanding for a number of years now that the reason people are in prison is because they have broken the law.

Yes, a professor at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Then back to the article. And again, the theme of students marching — this protest, that protest — relying on Woody Guthrie’s comments and the Good Samaritan’s actions to explain it all.</p>\n<p>Then, in wrapping up, came a stirring call for student protesters to go to the barricades. “When will this happen? When will we stand up? When will we ‘rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful struggle for a new world?’”</p>\n<p>Since I was now at the end of the article, I wondered about the logic of condemning war that defends Americans, because it is bad, and calling for war at the barricades, because it is good.
