It shows in the patriarchal culture the department embodies and perpetuates. It shows in the bankrupt values and ideologies the department institutionalizes and advocates. It shows in the department’s silencing and absencing of anything and anyone who questions or challenges its faulty and racist foundations and structure. It shows in the department’s legacy and habit of narrow white ways of knowing, thinking, acting and being. This is so apparent to us, because we have lived it. We have been laughed at for raising questions of difference. We have been told by you we do not belong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It thus is not so surprising to us that your hollow letter of concern to the geography community glosses over the death of George Floyd in such passing as to be completely tone deaf, at best, and purposely dog-whistling at worst. Floyd’s murder is not even the intention or attention of your sentence or concern. You say, “We realize these are indeed troubling times on many fronts,” and you associate what is troubling with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">events that</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his killing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be amusing to note, if not for the direness of this reality you contribute to, that your reference to the vile and unjust public execution of Floyd is myopically entangled within your seemingly indelible white privilege: how faculty must “grapple” with having to work from home. Is that really the reach of your concern? Is that really the best that you can do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, it is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">event of Floyd’s murder</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> deserves explicit recognition, direct condemnation and corrective actions. As do the murders of Breonna Taylor, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Stephon Clark and so many other Black people at the hands of those who are supposedly there to serve and protect. Does this trouble you? Or, do the “many fronts” of concern you mention express the vocal and visible challenges now being presented to the white hegemony the department has for so long promulgated and promoted? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. You and every chair of the department before you have, on several occasions, presided over a faculty that has turned down exceptional Black and Brown hires, including an African-American woman, a woman of African origin and a Nepalese woman, only to hire more white faculty. You and every chair before you have embodied a department that has done nothing to level the playing field with your privilege. The word “diversity” is spoken at faculty meetings as a token nod to progressive values, but you do nothing to make the department more welcoming to and inclusive of non-white students and potential Black, Brown and Indigenous faculty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what we DON’T need: more diversity seminars, webinars, colloquiums and forums that you can check off your to-do list. We DON’T need Black and Brown students and faculty to shoulder the burden of changing a system that claims “freedom of thought” but ends up keeping that platform for white voices, values and modes of geographical thought, methodologies, scholarship and activism.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a discipline that literally has the world as its focus, your myopic views and behaviors are an embarrassment and a failure. You uphold the racist and colonial legacy of geography by not confronting this very real history of the discipline, and you advocate and perpetuate these racist and colonial tendencies today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this truly brings you discomfort, if there is a modicum of sincerity in your message, you may then be asking: what CAN I do? The answer is: begin to change the entire structure of your department from within to work for corrective justice inside and outside your halls of privilege. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start teaching about the racist and colonial history of the very discipline you purport to represent. Step outside your comfort zones of white privilege and incorporate into all classes geographical issues of race and racism, privilege and marginalization, gender and identity, and resource destruction and exploitation. Actively recruit Black scholars and other scholars of color. Actively work with, take direction from, and cite and publish with Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. Actively examine the biases in your own work, in your own choices, and in your own institutions and power structures. And explicitly recognize and vocalize that electing a faculty of color as chair is far overdue. Actively work to change and correct this. And for the sake of all and any gods, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educate yourself</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And if there is any grain of sincerity in the department’s message, all of these steps must begin to be taken </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOW</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Recalling the words of Dr. King:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that       over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yes, these are indeed troubling times. Especially when your thoughts, given in abstract sympathy and for dubious ends, only serve to re-traumatize and build dams against a student body that has faced discrimination from your department since day one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your brief, ambiguous message presents and represents the full extent that this department is willing to go to in order to acknowledge what is happening outside the ivory tower, and we mean </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivory</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the only purpose it serves is to give comfort and satisfaction to those already enjoying the white privilege and power that tower provides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your next actions are as a chair and as a department — and make no mistake, silence and upholding the white status quo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is action </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— will be revealing of the sincerity or insincerity of your message to us, marginalized members of the UCSB geography community. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G</span><span style=\"font-weight:

We can hardly remember what it was like before the debut of the iPhone in 2007 — just 13 years ago. Twitter was founded 14 years ago, and now one of the most influential people on the planet, the President of the United States, sometimes sends out “information” over 100 times a day through the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of these technological advances, university life hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years — we still go to a lecture hall with over 200 people, professors still use chalkboards with chalk dust everywhere, and while we may have GauchoSpace and Umail, most students still prefer hand-written homework. There’s something irreplaceable about this aspect of learning. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, everything changed due to COVID-19. I have spent 95% of my time during the past two and a half months indoors in my apartment in Isla Vista. COVID-19 has forced an evolution to remote learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote learning is efficient, or at least it was intended to be. The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time. It is meant to be a direct connection to knowledge and professors. Yet my experience is that there are a lot more factors to take into account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, not going to school breaks the psychological state of studying. Rolling out of bed and opening my 32-inch display screen, which I also use to watch YouTube and play games, doesn’t make me feel like studying. I try my best to avoid using my laptop for leisure during the day, but it’s unavoidable. It requires much persistence to stay focused. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare this to sitting in a classroom, which is quiet and has hundreds of people around you studying. Even if you drift away for a bit, you usually come right back to focus because it “feels” like the right thing to do. As far as efficiency is concerned, while cutting back some inefficient activities, remote learning also introduces new ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, because it is more or less a forced change, a lot of details have not been figured out. For example, many lecturers are not used to writing on a tablet and screen recording, so now, they make videos talking over prepared slides. As a result, students can no longer see the steps of derivation, and they lose their natural signs and annotation in graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is with homework grading. The process usually involves students handing homework into a collection box before a deadline; then, the TA would collect them and distribute them to graders. Now, many classes use the GauchoSpace built-in function, which is, to put it mildly, bad for anything that requires stepped grading and commentary. Luckily, some commercial solutions exist, and many classes in S.T.E.M. subjects are utilizing them. It is impressive to see classes quickly learning to use these new tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think COVID-19 has forced innovation and exploration on the individual level, and remote learning will be a good thing in the long run. We are prepared to find a new way of living and learning with more resilience.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Jerry Ling</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitherto, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has already</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surpassed 2 million in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which represents </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over a quarter of the known cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. As the most powerful country with access to some of the best medical care and most advanced technologies, it is worth considering why there are a rising number of cases in the U.S. because this pandemic affects not only the overall economy of the nation, but also every one of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate that UCSB had changed its teaching mode to online before the coronavirus was widely spread. With this opportunity, I have returned to my home country, where the situation is mostly under control. Thanks to my professors, I do not have to stay up late to participate in live meetings because of my current time zone. In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been successful in keeping our classes up and running by leveraging our technology. Besides some of the negative experiences that remote learning may bring us, I think that it can also benefit us in many ways. For example, students save time they would normally spend commuting, therefore freeing up more time for focusing on their studies. They are also able to watch the recorded lectures repeatedly to strengthen any points in their classes they do not understand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we have had to abandon face-to-face conversations, I think this is an acceptable change. Nothing is more important than our collective safety. Turning to the discussion on online examinations, I do want to stress that teachers should be more flexible and considerate with students. We are all uneasy because of the current circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From my point of view, remote lecturing has been quite successful at UCSB. However, I am suspicious about the assertion that students can return to the campus in September. Although I have complete faith in UCSB’s resilience, I believe it is too early to make decisions. The situation seems to be persistent and since this type of lecturing is working, I think we should continue to learn online in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Robert Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid problems like Internet connectivity and time zone differences, I chose to remain in Santa Barbara during this period of remote learning. I was pretty optimistic about the epidemic at the time, and I thought that the situation would surely improve before summer vacation. So, I rented a house with my friend in Goleta and was ready to get used to this new learning method. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, spring quarter did not proceed as successfully as I anticipated. As a pre-chem student, I had to take two labs this quarter. It was very inconvenient to conduct both of the lab courses in an online format. Students had no access to manipulate data and make measurements by ourselves. Although TAs would record experiment videos for us, the experiments were not conducted by our own hands, and there were always some problems that we could not understand. We had to repeatedly stop and ask questions when finishing our lab reports, which was time-consuming. In addition, the lab manuals were partly revised because of the online learning. In one class, we needed to spend an extra two to three hours to complete each lab report. It seemed we did not truly grasp the knowledge we needed to learn in labs, and we wasted a lot of time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see some positive results from online learning. Many of my courses were recorded. This meant that I could choose when to study according to my habits. I did not have to get up early to catch the bus to campus and have to feel tired. I obtained a lot more sleep than I usually have and was more energetic when studying. In this way, online learning was helpful; however, I found I was not disciplined at home without a structured campus schedule. It was hard to be persistent with online learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 virus outbreak turned out to be much worse than I expected. I hope that our in-person interactions will return as soon as possible. My roommate got a flight to return home two weeks ago, so I am the only one left in the house. The air tickets are very expensive and difficult to purchase now. I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p>\n<p>– <em>Candace Chen</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-95010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-95010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/","id":5709,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5708,5707,5706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ask AJ: We’re Still in Quarantine Edition","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Ask AJ","publish_date":"2020-06-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ask-aj.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ask-aj.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Local advice guru AJ is back with more socially distanced tips.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_86187\" style=\"width: 444px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86187\" data-attachment-id=\"86187\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/ask-aj-love-on-the-brain/image_6483441-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ask aj\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86187\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?resize=434%2C326\" alt=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"326\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86187\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><b>I am moved by the protests that are happening right now across the country in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Thankfully, FaceTime and Zoom can help us stay in touch even when we cannot be physically together. Having game nights, cooking sessions or movie nights over Zoom can make you feel like she never left. When my best friend moved away for college, one idea we had was to send monthly friendship boxes. During finals week, we would ship each other self-care items and snacks to help cheer the other up. This helped us to always keep each other in our thoughts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to communicate is by sending letters. When my other friend was sent to the army, we would send long letters and photos regarding updates in our life. This made our conversations feel more meaningful. No matter how far the distance, a simple message showing you care helps keep a friendship bond strong. It’s also important to focus on the memories you made with her, and how in the future there will always be time to make more. As my friends and I were all moving off to different places in life for college and careers, I kept saying to them, this is not goodbye, but a to be continued</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Should I be rethinking my addiction to Puff Bars because of Corona?

Nicotine is linked to cancer and heart and lung diseases. These issues alone can shorten your lifespan significantly. Now with COVID-19 spreading through the world, our bodies need to be at their strongest to fight off this disease. The coronavirus is a respiratory disease that targets the lungs, and with weaker lung capacities from vaping, you are at risk to have more severe symptoms that can turn fatal.

Within 20 minutes of quitting, one’s elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop. After just a few weeks of not smoking, circulation improves and lung capacity increases. I understand how addicting nicotine can be, but I urge you to seek nicotine replacement therapies and the support of loved ones for quitting tobacco use.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Frosted tips: hot or not?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I can’t speak for everyone else, I know that whenever I see anyone with frosted tips, I assume they are going through a life crisis. Frosted tips to me are like cutting your own bangs, a last resort for excitement and change in one’s life. Now if you were Justin Timberlake in the 1990s, that would be a whole different story, but I don’t think this trend is coming back any time soon. If you want to dye your hair, I’d recommend something more natural and subtle like highlights. However, before you get in that salon chair, think long and hard about your decision. Speaking as someone who dyed their hair red in high school during a rebellious stage, it takes a lot of time and money to reverse. </span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

After speaking with other journalists of color and from my familiarity with work in other newsrooms, these are a few recommendations that I’m leaving behind. They are by no means the fullest extent of what the Nexus should be doing, but a few places to start. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish yearly or quarterly data on the diversity of the editorial staff.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a formal Diversity and Inclusion Board made up of members of the editorial staff as well as outside representatives. (The Daily Texan has a good reference for a Diversity and Inclusion board </span><a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2019/02/03/introducing-the-texans-raising-voices-initiatives-same-paper-new-commitment-to-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The goal of this board should be to serve as an internal resource for staffers and to oversee diversity initiatives. These should be paid positions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Nexus version of this </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uk0LrP2iM22rY39quqJZBZOstFNAGirJd5KH9hjRAKo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidelines for Inclusive Journalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document from the Seattle Times Diversity &amp; Inclusion Task Force and hold a mandatory staff-wide meeting to distribute it to all current and future editorial staff members and go over the content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate time and resources to doing intentional outreach to students of color and the many student-led organizations on campus that create spaces for students of color. Reach out to student leaders, ask to speak at meetings and open yourself up to feedback and criticism. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertise the opinion section, specifically the op-ed and letter to the editor columns, more broadly and more proactively so that the section reflects a diverse set of voices beyond just its consistent writers. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not enough for the Nexus to just undertake these initiatives to bring more staffers and editors of color into the newsroom. The Nexus, and its white leadership in particular, needs to be more conscientious about how to support these staffers and editors once they join the newsroom, and to listen to what they’re saying, even if it makes them uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus’ white leadership also needs to spend time educating themselves about race, and fostering conversations within the newsroom at large about how students of color are being covered. The newsroom cannot make progress if the Nexus tokenizes the editors of color that are on staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, I really naively thought that the Nexus was immune to the problems that plagued this industry. I know better now, and I ask that the Nexus takes these steps and more to do better for the students of color on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an outgoing editor at the Daily Nexus.

due to the stay-at-home orders following the spread of COVID-19, many of us suddenly have much more time on our hands. If you’re like me, you’ve been spending the vast majority of this time watching more Netflix than you’ve ever watched in your life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you view a movie every other night or five episodes of Grey’s Anatomy per day, binge watching streamable content has been a great source of comfort during these trying times. Indeed, research shows that </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix usage has risen at least 16%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since the first COVID-19 case in the US, revealing an increasing reliance on film and television media to help us through the dark reality of a global pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some, spending so much precious time consuming mindless content may seem like a waste of energy.

Fiction evokes strong emotions that help us process our tumultuous reality in a physically and emotionally safe environment, as well as offers an escape from our anxiety-ridden reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As psychology professors Raymond A. Mar and Keith Oatley </span><a href=\"http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2010_01.dir/pdfc8vBXO7Maa.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write in their study on “the function of fiction,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> narrative fiction “[offers] models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simplification, and compression…[creating] a deep immersive simulative experience of social interactions for [the audience].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is slightly depressing to consider, absorbing Netflix’s character-driven teen dramedies like “Never Have I Ever” and “The Half of It” may help us to subconsciously practice social interaction in a time when our in-person conversations are entirely limited to mealtime chats with family members or housemates. In its own way, Netflix’s original content is preparing us for a post-isolation world, when we will have to relearn how to interact with people other than the members of our household in order to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/4/16/21213635/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-legacy-quarantine-state-of-mind-frugality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break out of the “quarantine state of mind.”</span></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn down the lights, brew some tea and grab your favorite snack, because if there’s one curve we don’t need to worry about flattening in these trying times, it’s Netflix usage.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this “immersive simulative experience” to the extreme, Dan Olson of the YouTube channel Folding Ideas revealed in </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsSzrVhdVuw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his March 31 video “I Can’t Stop Watching Contagion”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has watched the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contagion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “over fifteen times in the last few weeks.” He is not alone in this grim fascination, for he reports that “according to Netflix, at the time of writing, it is the second most-watched thing in Canada.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem like a self-destructive plot to amplify anxiety, but as Olson puts it, “watching a disaster film in a disaster [exposes us] to what we’re already experiencing. Amplifying existing emotional states, it works as a form of emotional inoculation. I am scared and anxious and uncertain, and so I will make myself more scared and more anxious and more uncertain, because it’s still fiction. It’s still safe. It still has an end. It is bounded.”  There is a certain comfort in witnessing the resolution of a large-scale pandemic, the real-world equivalent of which still has no end in sight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps to explain the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan/status/1249803779794296832?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sudden attention in the Twitter meme-iverse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the oblivious beachgoers and irresponsible mayor of 1975’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaws.” While the parallels to our current reality are amusing at best and disturbingly uncanny at worst, we have something to learn from movies like “Jaws”: how to deal with a disaster or, perhaps more informatively, how local institutions, federal governments and even individual citizens can mishandle their response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond fiction’s practically and emotionally instructive qualities, it also provides the core psychological necessity for a society seemingly in freefall: escapism.

But Animal Crossing has reached </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/tech/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-quarantine/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its special kind of monumental success</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a two-fold reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that it’s creators have mastered the </span><a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/kawaii-art-japanese-culture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawaii aesthetic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Animal Crossing’s  endearing graphics and overall satisfying gameplay. Nintendo has long been a revolutionary titan in the video game industry, and Animal Crossing is just one of its exceptional successes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is timing. Quarantine has the world flipped upside down. Nothing makes sense, and nearly everyone and their mothers are coping with the newfound anxiety of doing simple tasks (like going to the grocery store and spending sleepless nights wondering if they have enough Lysol wipes). This is an unprecedented time. Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The melody of a wind chime plays. Your friends are fishing, catching butterflies and hunting for fossils. There’s not a single care in the world. There are bonfires on the beach, coconuts in the trees and the sunsets are colored in dreamy pastels. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Crossing today is what Bob Ross paintings were to the 80’s. Or maybe what Mr. Rogers was to the 70’s: singularly calming, serene and carefree. It’s the nonmedical treatment to the chaos that is our current cultural moment: a global pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first downloaded Pocket Camp, Animal Crossing’s smartphone app equivalent to the real game, I hoped it would cure my addiction to Solitaire and prove to be more interesting than Sudoku. Now, at Level 101 with a pimped-out campsite and tons of smartly dressed anthropomorphic friends, I think I can confidently say that I get the hype </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it’s real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve logged a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of time on this app. When I say scary, I mean it’s too embarrassing to admit aloud. Let’s just say I’ve set alarms in the middle of the night to make sure my </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animal friends have enough lychee fruits and horned dynastids. I don’t even know what a dynastid is, but you can bet I’ll be tapping my phone like a psychopath at three in the morning to catch them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stigma around “gamers” is real, though. But the judgment that used to plague the idea of spending hours staring at a screen seems to be temporarily lifted thanks to the quarantine. There’s only so many Alexis Ren ab workouts I can attempt and whipped coffee one can make in a day. I’m on TikTok, applying to summer jobs on Handshake and becoming a real Martha Stewart in the kitchen, but nothing feels more satisfying or relaxing than playing Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Camp is a judgement-free, Zoom-free, CNN-free zone. I don’t have to listen to the daily litany of lies our president rants about, I don’t have to read about the rise of death tolls without an end in sight, and I don’t feel guilty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarantine is a uniquely strange time to begin new things, like learn a hobby, level up on Duolingo, save your GPA, go on virtual Bumble dates and an endless amount of self-care. But, most importantly, it’s a time to stop thinking that the things that give you pleasure are indulgent and unproductive. No one that’s alive has ever lived through anything like this. So use this time the way you want to, do the things that make you genuinely happy and add me on Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson wants you to remember to have compassion for yourself.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As unions representing low-wage workers at the University of California, many of our members faced housing vulnerability before the global pandemic. Now, with COVID-19, housing insecurity is an even scarier reality. The shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders will not keep us safe if we cannot stay housed. And to put it simply, the UC is as unreliable an employer as they are a landlord.

Similarly, Philadelphia is seeing a </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-gun-violence-double-public-health-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% increase in homicide shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to last year. Many city leaders fear that, with increased possession of firearms and ammunition, the number of shootings may only increase further once lockdowns are lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidental shootings due to new possession of firearms are also on the rise. In Albuquerque, a man was arrested for </span><a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1434623/man-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-13-yr-old-cousin.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accidentally shooting and killing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his 13-year-old cousin. He told detectives that he was arming himself for protection amidst the coronavirus scare and hadn’t realized that his shotgun was loaded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, this influx in gun sales may be contributing to a decline in home safety. In Houston, </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-domestic-violence-victims-stay-at-home-orders-do-not-offer-safety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">domestic violence calls have increased by 6%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the month of March and were up by 21% percent in Phoenix. This trend is reverberating throughout the nation, as </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay-at-home orders are proving to be a danger for domestic violence victims, which is only exacerbated by the presence of a gun in the home. In Pennsylvania, a man reportedly </span><a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-latest-roderick-bliss-shoots-longtime-girlfriend-kills-self-after-being-extremely-upset-about-pandemic-losing-job-wilson-police-say/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot his girlfriend and then himself</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after losing his job due to the pandemic. Incidents like these, in which family members are the target of gun violence, are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, firearms have become a symbol of apocalyptic panic in this pandemic. Gun-toting protesters have flocked to state legislatures, in clear defiance of stay-at-home orders. It didn’t take long for </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michigan-capitol-protests-lockdown-stay-at-home-vote-armed-bulletproof-vest-a9493306.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pictures of these angry demonstrators</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> armed with assault rifles and screaming at politicians in bulletproof vests to circulate through social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing firearm businesses to remain open during this already high-strung period has ultimately produced more panic and fueled more violence than what previously existed. The fact that Americans believe that buying guns is a logical form of protection from this pandemic clearly indicates the growth of this mass hysteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increase in violence, if anything, should highlight the importance of gun control legislation. Now, exactly six years since the Isla Vista tragedy sparked activism in our own Santa Barbara community, gun violence remains as prevalent an issue as ever. For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Kocis rejects the labeling of firearms businesses as essential and pushes for greater gun control legislation.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

Unlike most kids running carefree through toy stores, panic paralyzed me as dinnertime, my cue to leave the store, inched closer. Sitting beside me, my dad put his hand on my back as I sat between stuffed animals. Each one had their own backstory, name and future adventure brimming on the horizon, but I could only take one home. For 30 whole minutes, my brain rattled with indecision. My fear of making the wrong choice ignited my anxiety, giving it a life force off of which to feed. Now, in a world flipped upside down by a pandemic, I continue to face tough choices as if I had never left that toy store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, instead of having to choose between two equally cute stuffed animals, now I find myself having to choose between an apartment and my parents’ house. Locked in contracts after what turned out to be a brief flirtation with independence, many college students are continuing to pay their leases while regressing on their parents’ couches. When faced with today’s housing conundrum, having to choose between remaining here or going “home,” I was confronted by the seemingly easy question of how to live. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running through my daydreams, both while I’m in Isla Vista and away, I wonder what really is the right decision. Is it right or selfish to stay in I.V.? At home, my body sinks when I picture the money I’m wasting, but at school, I imagine myself craving family. In truth, neither answer is what’s “right.” After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone all too familiar with indecision, I came up with this list of factors to help me figure out where it’s healthiest for me to live. And most importantly, a way to remember that there is no generic answer for knowing how to live happily and well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is first paramount to prioritize your own mental and physical safety. Families can stick together in a crisis, but that’s not necessarily true for everyone. There are many people who can’t go home because their loved ones are on the front lines, home is unwelcoming or because they have already settled in Santa Barbara. If you have an unstable relationship with your former guardians, going home can hurt more than it can help. In these already difficult times, think about yourself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it’s not selfish to live out your lease if leaving is better for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not for you. In times of trouble, there’s an expectation to gravitate homeward, but deciding to stay in your Isla Vista home, with your Isla Vista family, can be the best choice. Everyone should be with their preferred support system. Your priority should be to get through your assignments without compromising your mental health. Conversely, if staying in Isla Vista would do you more harm than good, then don’t think of leaving as “wasting money.” If your family home is where it’s safest, then don’t hesitate to go. While it’s difficult, carrying guilt over seemingly wasted money shouldn’t be your responsibility right now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also important to remember that money isn’t everything. None of us could have seen this coming. So while it’s easier said than done, don’t beat yourself up about whatever decision you make. The impact of COVID-19 will reshape how all future rent contracts work, but today, we’re already locked into pre-virus clauses. If that money is lost, remember that if the world wasn’t upside down, your I.V. home would be housing you. If the only reason you’re in I.V. is to justify your rent, please know that going home isn’t a defeat. Money will always matter, especially to those without much of it, but you matter as well. It’s better to prioritize your comfort, safety and sanity over saving on rent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing in that vein, trust yourself, no matter what your decision is. Amid this chaos, our lives remain our own. I compare myself to others all of the time. I look at people working more, in different fields or who are learning new skills, and wonder if my differences and lack of success make me less than. Have I made the wrong decisions? Where did I go wrong? Hearing about other people’s living choices during this pandemic has also left me in a state of fear. What do they know that I don’t? I haven’t shut down these thoughts, but I’ve learned to push them to the side, allowing them only to linger softly in the background of my mind like elevator music. We coexist, and in searching for my own confidence, I’ve learned to accept that I’ll never know if what I’m doing is right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being told what to do feels horrible, as if I’ve been deemed incapable. In the end, we are the only people who know, or can guess, what’s best for ourselves. And as such, no one should judge others for whatever living situation they choose.

Although there are many advantages and disadvantages of the digital switch, I found about three of each category that encapsulate the polarity of short-term effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new system allows for maximum flexibility; a student can study anytime and anywhere, such as inside their home obviously, and review recorded lectures as many times as they want. Another advantage is more individual attention and confidence. Have you ever felt like your question might be too dumb to blurt out in front of your peers? Well, since all interactions are now conducted through screens, that fear is much less of a deterrent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, online classes help you meet interesting people. The number of personalities that a single Zoom meeting projects is staggering. I have seen backgrounds that show a favorite Nickelodeon show setting, I have seen pets of all shapes and sizes (one student had a pet parasitic flatworm named Gary), but most importantly, I see you. I see individuals who probably shared a class with me in Phelps or Campbell Hall, and yet I never knew they existed. What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, online learning also presents certain challenges. At first, I thought, “How could there be any disadvantage to staying at home and learning when I want to?” Well, believe it or not, online classes require more time than on-campus courses. Since typing can be much slower than speaking, typing out questions for your professor and/or TA might take up more of your time. Also, many students are now reading significantly more than they were during standard class instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disadvantage is the sense of isolation. I know a handful of people who need to be in a social setting to study, who cannot focus without the subtle whispers in the library or giggles in a study room. Also, there isn’t much external support in an online environment. In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the most significant disadvantage of online education from home is procrastination. Procrastination has become a practical skill in the minds of many college students. Despite many working on fixing this bad habit of waiting to start assignments until the final hour, the new online environment makes it doubly challenging to overcome this habit and get stuff done without a set schedule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are mixed reviews related to the change from in-person lectures to online classes. However, the short-term effects are manageable and as time progresses students become more accustomed to the new norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what will happen as lectures linger in the online realm, and students begin to realize that in-person conferences weren’t as necessary as they seemed to be?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could potentially cause an increase in dropout rates. A 2011 </span><a href=\"https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study from Columbia University’s Community College Research Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CCRC) showed that community college students from Washington were more likely to drop from online courses than traditional ones. In fact, the completion rate of conventional classes was 90%, while online classes saw a rate of 82%. Furthermore, the study also showed that students who took online courses were less likely to transfer to another college or complete a degree altogether. By just taking one online class during the fall, the students from the CCRC study were 34% more likely to drop out after a single year, compared to 26% taking traditional courses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just one online class, the chances of dropping out increased by 8%. Can you imagine how an entirely online curriculum will affect the higher educational system?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering all of this, I believe that the greatest effect of the switch to online education will be adjustments to student tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The realization that I can learn the same amount of information from my bed as in a lecture hall makes me wonder if I really need to be paying so much to earn my degree from a prestigious university, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/16/college-students-are-rebelling-against-full-tuition-after-classes-move-online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I’m not the only one</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students across the world have the same concerns about the lack of a tuition adjustment in the wake of the complete change in curriculum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On its own, the price to attend a UC is gobsmacking compared to a community college. Of course, the large price tag assumes you are receiving an estimable education at one of the top research institutions in the nation. However, nobody is on campus anymore! And we won’t be there anytime soon, as </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2020-04-13-covid-19-update-summer-sessions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Yang has already informed students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that summer courses beginning in June and July will be online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quite frankly, I feel bad for those paying out-of-state tuition; non-residents who are paying over 15 grand to have online classes. No amount of Zoom is worth that much. Something has to be done with the current state of tuition. </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A petition was formed in response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to adjusting the spring 2020 tuition here at UCSB with the hope that Chancellor Yang would take notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving over 6,000 signatures on the petition, and despite having to lock myself indoors, watch Zoom lectures throughout the week and learn from a laptop, the tuition I pay is precisely the same.

We also love how attendees are able to annotate directly on the shared screen for everyone to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not know how to use our resources, don’t worry! Spend an hour or two with friends, exploring our platform. Play with virtual backgrounds. A quick search on our website can answer your queries. You can also reach out to your instructors for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your instructors will arrive a second before class starts, so don’t worry about leaving your place to arrive on time. Our instructors have excellent interpersonal skills. They like to wait a few minutes before officially starting a lecture: greeting students, oversharing or sitting in charming silence. I also certainly respect how our instructors have transitioned their lectures to be Zoom-friendly. No more iClicker questions. No more class readers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe in freedom of expression, allowing our students to demonstrate their individuality through their nicknames and chat room conversations. However, if a neighbor’s lawn mower roars, if your sister decides to blast reggae music or if your dog demonstrates their yearn for your attention through intense barking in the middle of a lecture, we expect you to mute yourself. Effective communication is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to turn on your camera, so the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawthorne effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensures that you are not goofing off. But make sure to tilt the camera away a little if you want to play chess or take a shower while on your phone. We support well-rounded students who participate in extracurriculars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also understand that everyone has different personalities. If you are a little bit shy or you have just woken up from a fat nap, or are in the process of diving back into a fat nap, nobody will be offended if you turn off your camera. But imagine your professor speaking to named black screens. Think of how lonely and awkward they must feel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We trust that you are capable of taking care of your own wellness. If you are hungry, bring a snack to your back-to-back Zoom meetings or bring your device to the kitchen. Meditate in between classes. Thanks to COVID-19, we have at-home exercise classes like yoga available if you know where to look.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for choosing Zoom University.

I wasn’t vehemently against it, but I couldn’t help but reflect on my past terrible relationships and wonder humorously what the future would hold if I had married one of my exes. Marriage in college would be highly distracting and an obstacle I could not balance with the pressure of school. I similarly thought about my indecisiveness in college so far and some of my friends who have changed their major at least a dozen times. How can someone be that sure about committing to someone in college when so many aspects of a college student’s life are constantly up in the air? I’ve changed so much from one year to another, and I couldn’t imagine how much I would adapt to marriage during these formative years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not just my reservations. It’s hard to think about the prospect of marriage in college when girls at universities are constantly tweeting about how they </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=text%20back&amp;src=typed_query\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“can’t get a text back.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are there college students out there who are truly mature enough to be in a seriously committed — not to mention legally binding — relationship and are willing to be tied down for the rest of their lives at age 20? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, there have been various stories about couples who have gotten married in college — some heartwarming and others disheartening. Reading through a </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2v810z/guys_who_got_married_in_college_what_happened_how/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit thread</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of couples who married in college, I was amazed by how many couples got married in their first or second year of college and who have been together for 10, maybe even 20 years since then, living together happily with kids. Of course, some weren’t as lucky and ended up divorcing because their life paths inevitably moved in very different directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have a few friends who have gotten married right when they hit college — all married to guys enlisted in the military. It is not unexpected that military marriages occur right before deployment because of </span><a href=\"https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2014/12/11/married-military-look-inside-young-military-marriages/20263373/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term separation, among other factors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My best friend from middle school and the better half of high school ended up getting married at the end of high school, which I could have never imagined happening. One moment, I could remember us running around in her neighborhood (quite literally) chasing after a boy we both liked, and the next, she had a serious boyfriend for four years whom she married in a small ceremony. It was a shock to my system, especially since she ultimately ended up giving up a lot of her dreams for him, like dropping out of college and forgoing her veterinary aspirations to live with him in California where he is stationed. But ultimately, I did know one thing: She loved being with him, no matter the cost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in young adulthood are so dynamic and clouded by uncertainty. One day, you could be celebrating your birthday with your best friend, and the next year, she’s gone from your life without so much as a “happy birthday” text. If you can find a built-in best friend in a marital partner during the craziness that is college, that is definitely something to cherish. Having someone who is a constant in your life, with whom you can share the exciting and devastating moments is comforting, to say the least. It’s nice to have someone who won’t outgrow you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think part of the problem people have with college students getting married is that we have become a largely judgemental society. We adhere to an unrealistic timeline of when major life events should “ideally” occur that defines what is and is not socially acceptable. Not only is this timeline plastered </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-age-to-get-married-is-26-2017-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all over the internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it is also ingrained in familial expectations: Graduate college, get a job, get married somewhere between the ages of 24-28 and have kids before 35. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to reflect on our predisposed notions of how others should live their lives. Because at the end of the day, who should really care if you’re breaking the norm? If you found the right person that brings you immense happiness — why wait?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, college students are constantly evolving and maturing, often for the first time on their own. I definitely have experienced personal growth from high school to college when it comes to seeing the red flags in my relationships. I’ve witnessed the dissolution of some of my friends’ romantic relationships as a consequence of misunderstanding each other or having stark contrasting visions for their futures. I believe that at the end of the day, if someone is in your life who accepts you fundamentally and wants to grow with you, they’re worth holding onto. Marriage at a young age can ultimately contribute to a unique perspective that can yield purpose and focus that others won’t experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will not deny that my personality trait of being a hopeless romantic has contributed to my altered stance on marriage in college. While I haven’t been involved in the healthiest romantic relationships and have yet to date a guy who has truly cherished and accepted me for the person I am, I’ve seen deep respect in a relationship form almost effortlessly in couples around me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve seen the spark blow out in a relationship of mine and reignite with someone new just as fast as the next week. People enter our lives at very fateful moments, and when we individually decide to get married should ultimately depend on individual circumstances — not outside influences or societal expectations.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai encourages you to make individualized decisions independent of socially constructed ideals. </span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94091\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94091\" data-attachment-id=\"94091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-01/argument-in-the-office-married-during-college/college-marriage-opinion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"college marriage opinion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94091\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melody Wang / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Say No To the Dress</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Sara Rubin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picture this. You are standing in an aisle, staring at the love of your life while your friends and family watch you take a vow that will last for eternity. During my childhood, I was ingrained with the idea of a magical fairytale wedding. Disney Princess movies gave me a conventional and outdated model. They filled me with hopes that my prince charming would one day rescue me with a kiss. Later in life, romantic movies taught me that at the end of the day, love always wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I am nearing almost 20 years old, and the fantasy wedding I used to dress my Barbie dolls up for is the furthest thing from my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that I have stopped believing in love. I still hold on to the notion that one day I will find my knight in shining armor. But while taking marriage vows and having a family are important to me, I could never imagine committing myself to someone for the rest of my life in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s begin by assuming that one has already met the love of their life this early. The first point I would like to emphasize is how young and inexperienced we all are. Most of us have never owned our own apartment or house, have never had a full time job and don’t know what it is like to be 100% independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newfound freedom we experience in college is an important stepping stone towards becoming full-fledged adults. However, if one decides to get married at this young age, they are skipping past the growth and change you experience when you are forced to stand on your own two feet. Life is full of uncertainties, and while having someone by your side is a constant that can bring comfort, you are also hindering your capability to rely on yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strength and new skills one acquires when living on their own can help prepare a person for the uncertainties that can be thrown at them in the future. This dependence on another can lead one to forgo taking responsibility for their own actions, as they will always expect someone else to help them with their mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, one never learns how to accept being alone. My grandmother always told me that “we must be the center of our own universe, because the one constant in our lives is ourselves.” As college students, we are experiencing a pivotal and impressionable time in our lives, and if we don’t learn how to not only accept but enjoy being alone, then we will never have the strength to get through life with just ourselves. Self-love and self-confidence are what drive us to reach for our dreams, and to be happy with who we are. That is a rather difficult goal to achieve when someone else provides emotional security for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to point out how important exposing oneself to different relationships is. While I have dated a few people already, I would not feel ready to commit the rest of my life to another person without going through at least a few more heartbreaks. Relationships teach us important lessons regarding life, and help us find out who we truly are. Marriage is a huge step, and I know I will need more practice being in  relationships before taking it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating also shows us what qualities we want in a partner, and what qualities we don’t. These lessons are a gift that help reveal more of who we are. Not many other circumstances in life can better demonstrate one’s strength than having to overcome a breakup. To have that history is imperative. When we finally find the person we want to be with, we will have learned from our past and understood what it takes to really make a relationship work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time in our lives we are undergoing massive changes. Grad schools or job offers can be across the country from one another, and it’s difficult to pick up your whole life and move when another person is involved. If your partner keeps you from pursuing your full potential, you may begin to resent one another. Sacrifice is often needed for a marriage to work; however, to forgo such big opportunities is unfair for everyone involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes occur in ourselves as well. I often hear adults say that the person they were in college is nothing like the person they are today. We mature and learn an abundance of lessons during this period and sometimes the individual you marry will not be the same person years later. This “metamorphosis” can change how two people work together, and turn a once-perfect marriage sour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, this argument is not to deter people from marrying altogether.

When Sanders ended his campaign, it was unlikely that he could have taken the nomination, being that he was so far behind Biden in the vote count. Sanders has maintained similar stances through both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, which many considered far too “radical.” Undoubtedly, many Democrats were fearful that in the general election, voters would be hesitant to embrace his ideas. On the other hand, Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is a far more moderate candidate, making him an appealing choice for a wider range of voters and the Democratic National Committee itself. Consequently, some Sanders supporters are reluctant to grant their vote to Biden. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders’ demographic is primarily young people, many of whom have taken to the internet to express their frustration in the wake of his decision. They have coined the phrase “Bernie or Bust” to express their refusal to vote for Biden in the general presidential election. Some of these supporters have stated that they will not be voting in the election at all, or that they will be writing Sanders on the ballot instead.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I stand for Sanders’ positions, this is an irresponsible use of one’s right to vote. Once again, we find ourselves set to watch a battle between two nonoptimal old white men. The position we have been put in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> forced to choose the lesser of two evils </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far from ideal.

This is not a swing state, and because of the electoral college, it can be assumed that California will go to whoever the Democratic nominee is. However, your vote is still needed. Safe states haven’t always been safe states: The position of the state either changes or stays the same through the votes of individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2016 election, we saw a battle between the popular vote and the electoral college. The people chose Clinton, and the system chose Donald Trump. This is definitely a testament to the corruption inherent in our system. Without the quantity of individual voters, this corruption wouldn’t have been exposed. More so, if you don’t go to the polls in November, your vote for local positions and propositions will also go unconsidered. If anything, you should feel a stronger desire to vote in local elections, as the outcome of these elections will impact you more directly. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Sanders’ announcement, Biden took to the stage and addressed Sanders supporters. </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He assured us,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.” This may seem unconvincing to many of us, but Sanders himself has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-endorsement.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his former competitor. In a joint livestream appearance, he said to Biden, “We need you in the White House. And I will do all that I can to see that that happens.” Following Sanders’ endorsement came the endorsements of former President Barack Obama and previous candidate Elizabeth Warren. The fact that these figures have turned their support toward Biden enhances the importance of our support to Biden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, I find a “blue no matter who” mindset to be an ignorant one. There is much more to consider about a candidate than simply the political party they identify with. It is important to research candidates and be clear about their stance on different issues. Just because someone identifies with a certain party doesn’t mean that their views or voting record align with said party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what I</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want to stress is the importance of your vote. A vote for Biden is not only that, but it is also a vote against Trump. Many of us believe that Trump’s position in the White House has been a major step in the wrong direction for our country. Sanders’ proposals of Medicare for All, cancellation of college debt and the Green New Deal gave us hope for the future. We must continue to fight for these progressive causes. While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biden’s campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prioritizes healthcare, environmental issues and the economy. He proposes to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower the age of eligibility for Medicare. As for the environmental crisis, Biden promises that he will lead our country toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Biden favors an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and an overall strengthening of support for the middle working class. Comparatively, </span><a href=\"https://www.promiseskept.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been working to repeal Obamacare, leading to an increasing number of uninsured Americans. He has pulled our country out of the Paris Climate Agreement, with the intent to continue drilling and rescind the Clean Power Plan. Trump has decreased unemployment, which still stands high, but tax cuts for the upper class have affected the country elsewhere </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example, bringing about the increase in uninsured Americans. Trump has prioritized the 1%. Biden’s policies are not as progressive as Sanders’. They are, however, monumentally better than Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We needn’t give up on the things that Sanders promised us; we can continue to strive for the implementation of those policies. Biden gives us the best possible chance for these desired changes to come to fruition. As we move closer to the November election, I ask you to take this into consideration. Your right to vote is one of the privileges of living in a democratic society. Use it wisely.

Gone are the days of being bombarded in the Arbor, struggling to find a seat in the crowded lib or trying to make it out of a rush-hour bike lane. Quarantining makes it difficult to feel connected to others and even easier to feel alone. Being cut off from people and resources for such extended periods of time can be hard on your mental health. The constant influx of news updates surrounding the pandemic is overwhelming and anxiety producing, and there is a plethora of false information being spread across online platforms. Despite this, social media is more necessary now than ever before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is often portrayed as useless and a killer of productivity, amounting to nothing but mindless scrolling through feeds. It’s been criticized for causing </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/is-social-media-contributing-to-the-stigma-around-depression-and-anxiety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feelings of social isolation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fear of missing out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Now, in a time of physical isolation, there’s nothing to miss out on. Social media has become invaluable as a tool that can help us feel a more intimate connection to others and restore a sense of normalcy to the chaos uprooting our lives. Without the physical markers of everyday life that we have come to depend on, many of us may be losing track of time, our responsibilities and our lives in general. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I witness my Twitter timeline collectively descend into insanity every few hours, I am consoled by the knowledge that I am not alone in these feelings. We might all be scared, but at least we can know that we’re all in this together. Being able to make fun of our nervousness and unease with others who share these sentiments is an immense source of comfort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sudden shift to online courses, taken in isolation, has proven itself to be a difficult adjustment. Seeing memes shared on Facebook about other students’ complete lack of a sleep schedule or motivation to do any assignments is reassuring in that the experiences we are struggling with are shared. We can’t share these experiences in person, but this makes it all the more essential that we can share them online. That is, for those of us fortunate enough to be able to be bored and concerned by these challenges alone, social media has taken on an even more critical role in our lives.</span></p>\n<p>With the possibility for spontaneous social interaction removed from our daily lives, social media is now the only way we can stay in touch with others on a large scale. Many of us have started feeling the need to communicate with and be perceived by our peers in a way reminiscent of in-person interaction. This is evident on social media in the surge of viral challenges: from posting unflattering pictures just to take them down the next day, doing push-ups in a video chain, filling out oddly specific bingos or just finding excuses to tag 10 friends.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us have started feeling the need to communicate with and be perceived by our peers in a way reminiscent of in-person interaction.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, there might not be anybody listening to each and every song from your 30-day song challenge, but what matters is that you feel like you’re staying connected. Illusory or not, this sense of connectivity and community is so important in preserving our sanity and preventing us from feeling isolated. Social media has also supported the rise of quarantine hobbies, and every Dalgona coffee made or TikTok dance learned brings us one step closer together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending too much time online is usually never a good thing, but the digital world is quickly becoming the social reality for us for a substantial part of the near future. The pandemic has brought with it a social crisis, and social media is helping us ease this loneliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the days spent alone blur together, videoconferencing sites like Zoom are helping us redefine and reconstruct our social lives. The past feels a lifetime away, the future is scarily uncertain, so we’re left trying to share as much of the present as possible. Social media allows us to feel connected to those whose presence we miss, creating a virtual community from wherever we are. Even though we think of what life was like before we were thrust into isolation, this time spent apart from loved ones will make the days together more valuable. We may feel lonely, but social media reminds us that we are far from alone. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo hopes this article finds you well in these strange and uncertain times.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Veronica Vo</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Veronica Vo is an opinion staff writer and a second year psychology major.
