III.” “These days, these days, I can’t win/These days, I can’t see no visions/I’m breaking, losing faith,” Danielle sings on the chorus of “Los Angeles” while surrounded by bright and sunshiny production.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The themes on this album are darker than normal, owing to a string of recent trauma in the sisters’ lives. Danielle’s boyfriend and album producer Ariel Rechtshaid had a bout of cancer, Este has dealt with diabetes and Alana has been grieving for a best friend’s death. All of these struggles are felt in “Hallelujah,” the most poignant and straightforward song of the bunch, which is about gratitude toward sisterhood. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My verse is about our relationship as sisters </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This song is a big thank you to the people in your life that love and support you every day,” </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/haimtheband/posts/10156270402481841?comment_id=10156270578396841\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danielle wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a Facebook post upon the song’s release last November. The stripped-back production and gorgeous harmonies make it sound like a 2020 version of </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and when Alana sings, “I had a best friend but she has come to pass/One I wish I could see now,” the emotions running through the song feel similar as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not written for quarantine but perfect for it, “I Know Alone” perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being stuck in a rut with no one to come help. “Nights turn into days/That turn to grey/Keep turning over/Some things never grow/I know alone/Like no one else does,” Danielle murmurs on the chorus across a bouncy, dark instrumental, one of Haim’s pop-friendly beats. “I’ve Been Down” also perfectly matches quarantine life: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to get myself through this/And I’ve been watching too much TV/Looking up at the ceiling/It’s been making me feel creepy.” Despite a clunky chorus with the “Come on, come on, come on, baby” repetition, this song overall features some of the most down-to-earth lyrics on the record.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I’m In It,” which is about catching yourself the moment you start to enter into a depressive episode, sounds brighter on the surface but is equally as dark lyrically. The opening lines, “Looking in the mirror again and again/Wishing the reflection would tell me something/I, I can’t get a hold of myself/I can’t get outta this situation,” spoken fast over a pulsating instrumental gives an example of the kind of racing thoughts in the narrator’s head. While “Cause now I’m in it/But I’ve been trying to find my way back for a minute/Damn, I’m in it” shows the moment of recognition and acceptance, “Something in the way that I felt when I woke up/Told me that I shouldn’t give in, give up hope” demonstrates resilience and the hopeful attitude necessary for those kinds of days. The vocal layering, production and lyrics all combine to produce a fantastic song, one which we could all relate to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sisters also write about relationship problems, but they do it in a way that always feels lighthearted, like they know they’ll be okay. “Don’t Wanna” describes being in a loose, early relationship but one that feels like it’ll be the right path. “Well, we both have nights/Waking up in strangers’ beds/But I don’t wanna, don’t wanna/I don’t wanna give up yet,” they sing on the chorus that explodes when it gets to the outro, combining layers of instrumentation and background vocals that work so well together. Although it’s basically the same song, “Another Try” also mentions relationship problems, this time over a tropical, breezy beat that’s close to, but not crossing, the line of cliché.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guitar-driven and featuring shining vocals, “The Steps” deals with a partner not realizing one’s self-worth and individuality. “And every day I wake up and I make money for myself/And though we share a bed, you know that I don’t need your help/Do you understand?/You don’t understand me, baby,” they assert on the chorus. Though it’s a less engaging track, “Man from the Magazine” deals with feminism as well, recounting an invasive experience with journalists. “‘Do you make the same faces in bed?’/Hey, man, what kind of question is that?” alone shows how much the Haim sisters have had to deal with being three women in music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of HAIM’s best work shows up in this tracklist, though differing in style. “Up From A Dream” has a foggy atmosphere and heavy baseline that makes way for an amazing guitar solo. It features dazed lyrics, as if the narrator has literally just woken up (“Something you see wakes you up from the dream/Wanna go back to sleep but now you’re up from the dream.”) “3AM” is an irresistibly catchy throwback to ’90s R&amp;B, complete with a voicemail intro </span><a href=\"https://genius.com/Haim-3-am-lyrics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that had to be auditioned for by the sisters’ friends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you can hear the amount of joy and laughs we had making this song,” </span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/women-in-music-pt-iii/1500020581\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alana told Apple Music</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On the album closer, “Summer Girl,” Danielle writes about Rechtshaid’s diagnosis but with a reaffirming and positive tone: “I see it in your face, I’m relief/I’m your summer girl.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Haim sisters had to travel through darkness to create this record, but on the other side was a tunnel of light you can hear through the quality production. Their writing is real, unforced and instantly relatable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 8/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-94951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of IMDb</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the footsteps of other prominent directors, Spike Lee has now released his first film on a streaming platform: Netflix. His newest film “Da 5 Bloods” is extremely political, and like his other films, focuses on Black struggles and oppression. Any history buff would enjoy it, but I recommend the film to everyone because the issues examined in it are unfortunately still prevalent today; especially right now with the new wave of the Black Lives Matter movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 5 Bloods are a group of five black men who were sent to fight for America during the Vietnam War. The film focuses on Paul (Delroy Lindo), Paul’s son David (Jonathan Majors), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Witlock Jr.), and Norman (Chadwick Boseman). The film opens with a clip of Muhammad Ali, who famously condemned the killings of people abroad because unlike the United States, those countries “never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality.” This starts a montage overlapped with Marvin Gaye’s voice, which is the first time of many he is heard in the film. There are clips of Black soldiers, war scenes and historical moments that happened around the time of the war, which was fought from 1955 to 1975. Then, there are photo inserts of Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis and Malcolm X, whose speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie, along with references to Black riots in response to injustices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Netflix preview I got the impression that the film was going to be primarily set during the Vietnam War, but instead it focused on the Bloods during modern-day America, and their time in the war was only briefly shown through flashbacks. Norman was killed during the war, so the other four Bloods return to Vietnam to find his body and the gold they buried about 40 years prior. One of Spike Lee’s most interesting cinematographic choices was to film the flashbacks with the same older actors that portray the four Bloods as in the present-day plot, instead of using younger ones in their place. In my opinion, this was a better choice because the four men were recalling their time in Vietnam and all were able to see themselves as the age they are, but they only remember Norman as young. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire journey in Vietnam brings back memories of the torture that the Bloods went through when they were young soldiers. They show symptoms of the PTSD they still experience, and though they seem proud to call themselves Americans, they also express the disgusting oppression they’ve been subjected to their entire lives. The war is also constantly referred to as the “American War” by the Vietnamese people, who still hold resentment towards the U.S. Yet, both sides show bitterness to each other still to this day; and as the Bloods’ tour guide discloses, “After you’ve been in a war, you understand it never really ends,” which the audience sees through the Blood’s own nervous breakdowns and in tense moments between them and Vietnamese locals who claim the men killed their families. Paul specifically becomes livid at the locals’ statements, and it is only at the end through his visions of Norman that he is able to own up to the truth of his corrupt time in the military. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Norman wasn’t only one of the 5 Bloods but also their leader, teacher and preacher. Otis explained he gave the bloods “Something to believe in. A direction, a purpose. He taught us about Black history when it wasn’t really popular back then… Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.” Norman emphasized peace and justice but wasn’t afraid to show his frustration with the treatment of Black people in America, and who better to have as the heroic idol of the group than the Black Panther himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one of his many teachings, Norman stressed that “War is about money. Money is about war. Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it’s some police state. I can feel just how much I ain’t worth.” Black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a country that was not fighting for them. They were fighting for the rights that they weren’t yet granted, and they were sent to die. Black and brown men disproportionately died during the war, because they were disproportionately sent. As Otis explains to Paul’s young son David, “White boys who stayed in college, they’d dodge that shit. They put our poor Black asses on the front lines, killing us off like flies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Da 5 Bloods” deals with emotional trauma caused because of the war, trust issues, complex relationships with fathers and the many and seemingly never-ending injustices experienced by Black people in America. While not my favorite Spike Lee movie, it was still an enjoyable and beneficial watch. The film takes a different approach to Vietnam War films, most of which focus on the hardships of white soldiers and may portray one token Black actor. They too often ignore and erase the Black men who were thrown into an unjust war and died for a country that didn’t care about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film reflects on how little change has happened since the Vietnam War, and how Black people in America still have to worry about losing their lives and lack of full rights every single day. Justice is slow, and because of that many of us get burnt out and discouraged, but we must continue to fight for our rights. Part of Netflix’s new Black Lives Matter category, the release date of “Da 5 Bloods” couldn’t have been at a more fitting time, and watching films that address systemic racism still prevalent in American society is a great way of educating yourself about Black issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3.5/5 </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

(The special can be accessed on Netflix’s YouTube channel, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4&amp;t=6s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special comes in the wake of nationwide and worldwide protests denouncing the murder of George Floyd and police brutality and systemic racism against Black Americans as a whole, with renewed calls for justice for Black Americans who have lost their lives to police officers that engaged in excessive behavior. It also comes in the middle of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the first few shots showing temperature checks being conducted at the door and socially distanced seating at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special begins with Chappelle recounting his experience with the Northridge Earthquake, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the San Fernando Valley region back in 1994. He recalls the tremors lasting about 35 seconds, and even for such a seemingly short time, he thought he might die, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of his life. It becomes harrowing, then, to try to imagine what George Floyd went through in the eight minutes and forty-six seconds that preceded his death. More so, Chappelle uses the moment to raise questions about what an incident like this — an almost nine-minute long murder in broad daylight with multiple bystanders — says about a society in which a man could do that do another man and “not feel like he was going to get the wrath of God.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Chappelle, the riots and protests engulfing the nation and world right now have been a long time coming. He responds to criticism from Don Lemon, a commentator for CNN, who asked why more celebrities haven’t been speaking out, to which Chappelle questions the very need to look to (often </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/celebrities-racism-i-take-responsibility-video.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clueless</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) celebrities for leadership, observing that “the streets are speaking for themselves right now.” He also responds to Black conservative firebrand Candace Owens, who released a video refusing to embrace George Floyd, a convicted criminal, as a martyr or hero for Black America. Chappelle angrily counters, stating that he does not care what George Floyd did. George Floyd was simply the man that this grave injustice was committed against, and that is why his name is in the papers. He remarks, in one of the more poignant moments of the show, “we aren’t desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n***a that makes it through this nightmare is my goddamned hero.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worth noting here is that this is far from the typical material in Chappelle’s standup, yet does perhaps the best job of all his material at communicating how Dave Chappelle, a Black American, feels about the world he has to face every day. With over 24 million views at the time of writing, it’s also a clear symbol of how much people trust and respect his voice. As someone used to seeing aggressive polarization at every turn of the world, it was genuinely astonishing for me to see neither Don Lemon nor Candace Owens get very defensive over the jokes, and actually independently express their honor and joy at being memorialized in a Dave Chappelle special and to reiterate their belief that he is one of the greatest comedians of all time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of trust is rare, to say the least, and doesn’t seem to be something Chappelle takes for granted. He explores this in the special, recognizing that people seem to trust him because the realness of his jokes make people feel like he’s not lying to them. Yet, he points out, every institution that the people are supposed to trust, from the police to the government, lies to them on almost every level. He ponders the idea that maybe it’s time we figured out better voices to listen to and found better ways to get people to listen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty incredible to see Chappelle pack in this many emotions, jokes and meaningful moments of social commentary into a comedy special that clocks in at a little under 30 minutes. If you’ve seen Chappelle’s old specials tackling the material of police brutality (his 2000 special “Killin’ Them Softly” is hilarious and outstanding), it’s really interesting to view “8:46” as a mature conclusion to those same ideas. Rather than adding to his arsenal of jokes on the topic, this special more somberly lays out his grief at the repeated injustices that Black Americans have to live their entire lives in fear of being victims of. Approaching the topic with a unique combination of sensitivity, moments of light-heartedness and hurt resignation, “8:46” makes for some of Chappelle’s most profound social commentary yet. In today’s cascade of conflicting and angry voices, I think his views are, at the very least, a perspective to deeply consider, regardless of your political views.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 9.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/","id":6262,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6261,6260,6259],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“The King of Staten Island” Is Exactly What You Think It Is","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2020-06-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/king-of-staten-island-e1591991724837.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/king-of-staten-island-e1591991724837.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In true Davidson fashion, “The King of Staten Island” tackles serious issues with abrasive sarcasm and laugh-out-loud one-liners.

Spoilers ahead. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judd Apatow has long found his niche in Hollywood with films that drive their lovable yet woefully aimless protagonists to take a hard look in the mirror, with a dramatic transformation often materializing right before they hit rock bottom. With his latest comedic venture, “The King of Staten Island,” the director trades in his signature smutty jokes and raunchy shticks (think “Knocked Up” or “The 40-Year-Old Virgin”) for a more down-to-earth approach to themes of grief, ambition and self-worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is a clear departure from what audiences have come to associate with Apatow, as he taps Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson for a loosely based retelling of the stand-up comedian’s upbringing in the New York City borough of Staten Island. If you’re watching the movie as an invested fan of Davidson’s or are committed to watching any and all Apatow films, the 137-minute runtime may not be a big deal. When the dust settles, however, “The King of Staten Island” amounts to more or less what you would expect from an Apatow-Davidson collaboration: a subliminally funny yet at-times sluggish plot that milks Davidson’s life story for all it is worth. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson stars as Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old high school dropout who lives at home in Staten Island with his widowed mother Margie (Marisa Tomei), and his younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow), who is about to leave for college. Scott, who has never fully recovered from the sudden death of his father when he was seven, openly embraces his miserable existence and tendency to inflict pain on himself as he proceeds to wreck every personal relationship in his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott’s unresolved sense of loss surrounding his father’s passing, a fireman who was killed in a hotel fire, draws from Davidson’s own experience losing his father, a fireman who perished in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. For the past 17 years, Scott’s life has effectively been paralyzed, which he is acutely aware of yet comfortable ignoring. He passes the time  — perpetually high — by lazing around with his friends and hooking up with a girl named Kelsey (Bel Powley), who desperately wants to take their relationship to the next level while Scott is determined to keep things the same. His one and only aspiration is to open a restaurant which doubles as a tattoo parlor, to be named “Ruby Tattoos-days.” (With ink covering pretty much every inch of his body from the neck down, Scott claims that the pain of the needle relaxes him.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his mother starts to date another fireman named Ray Bishop (Bill Burr), who is incidentally the father of a little boy who Scott tries to tattoo in a park, Scott sees this as the ultimate act of betrayal against his deceased father and does everything in his power to break up the two. His mother, who finally wakes up to the fact that her son is a grown man who has been coddled for far too long, kicks Scott out of the house until he is better equipped to deal with his problems. Scott finds refuge in an unlikely place: the firehouse where Ray works, where Scott learns more about his father and about sustaining the relationships that matter to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In true Davidson fashion, “The King of Staten Island” tackles Scott’s serious underlying issues with abrasive sarcasm and laugh-out-loud one-liners, and it is his charming knack for self-deprecation that makes the largely forced writing bearable. Not forced, however, is Davidson’s acting — a pleasant surprise considering the number of comedians-turned-actors who have delivered lackluster performances over the years. Scott’s awkwardly dark humor and goofy facial expressions are so reminiscent of Davidson’s real-life persona that it is easy to forget that a camera is not just following him around as he meanders through Staten Island. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the storyline is simply not gripping enough to justify its lengthy runtime, the film genuinely translates as an inside look into Scott’s muddled, THC-infused mind, as well as into the forgotten borough which shaped Davidson/Scott into the man he is today. The casting seems a little uninspired — Marisa Tomei in yet another mom role and Steve Buscemi makes a gratuitous appearance — but they serve their purpose as prop characters while Davidson takes center stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you stick it out to the end, you may be wondering why this film came to fruition at all, since there is nothing that Davidson hasn’t addressed in his stand-up a million times already. Apatow, who has struck comedic gold with films that our generation will talk about for years to come, undoubtedly fell flat with this one. Some may find Scott’s childlike temperament to be too much, in which case there is nothing here for them. If, however, you find Scott to be incomprehensibly endearing, like me, you just can’t help but root for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 6.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

“Chromatica.” After the country and folk-influenced “Joanne,” fans were hungry for Gaga’s return to culture-defining electro-pop songs. She delivers with this record, producing a collection of 13 songs with three interludes that are pure pop, all with clean instrumentals and some of Gaga’s finest songwriting to date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the album’s strengths, the road to release was one of the clunkiest I’ve ever seen for an A-list artist. After the lead single “Stupid Love” leaked, it was released in late February with no additional changes. The release date for “Chromatica” was initially set for April 10, but it was pushed back to May 29 due to coronavirus concerns, which she addressed in an </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-H1QjNlwyx/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emotional Instagram note</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Soon after, </span><a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2079270/lady-gaga-chromatica-album-cover-leak/news/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the cover art leaked in full</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, forcing her to reveal it earlier. When all the destruction seemed to be done, </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-chromatica-tracklist-target-leaked.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target accidentally released the tracklist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when it stocked the album for pre-release on its website. Snippets for songs like “Babylon,” “Rain On Me,” and “Free Woman” all leaked and, instead of capitalizing on this momentum, Gaga’s team did not release a second single until a week before the album. Even the setbacks couldn’t stop one of pop’s most influential faces, and the album was released last week to </span><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/chromatica/lady-gaga?ref=hp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critical praise</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead single “Stupid Love” is pure guilty-pleasure music, and is an </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/lady-gaga-stupid-love-review-glorious-pop-yearning/607207/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">immediate return to the pop that she’s known and loved for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With an ‘80s flair and a thumping beat, the track left fans needing more of the same from the rest of the album. Interestingly, “Stupid Love” is probably the most unique of the album; the song’s light and airy backdrop is a standout against the dark, instrumental-heavy tracks.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second single, “Rain On Me,” features pop superstar Ariana Grande and is altogether a dynamo of a song, one that gets more fun every time I listen to it. The song is about persevering through hard moments, and despite wishing for them to be over, remaining strong in the face of adversity. “I’d rather be dry, but at least I’m alive/Rain on me, rain rain,” she sings. The video is an instant classic, featuring Gaga and Grande drenched in rain, dancing through it all with various wardrobe changes and futuristic sets. Whereas “Stupid Love” seemed campy and costume-like, “Rain On Me” is professional and, while still silly and fun, very well produced for artists of such high caliber.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that “Sour Candy,” a collaboration with South Korea’s most recognizable girl group BLACKPINK, would be a good song if you listened to it with your brain turned off. The catchy house instrumental borrows the same sample that Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish” did, but some of the lyrics fall apart. Admittedly, “I’m sour candy/So sweet then I get a little angry” is a clever line, but there aren’t enough good ideas on the song to back it up. The BLACKPINK members deliver as good of a job as they can on a five-person 2-and-a-half-minute song, especially when delivering lines as cutting as “Ask me to be nice, and then I’ll do it extra mean.” No matter your opinion on K-pop or </span><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/kpop-twitter-fancam-reply-trend/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how its fans act on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this genre has leaped into the Western cultural sphere, and a feature on a Lady Gaga song solidifies its relevance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The previously mentioned “Babylon,” with an </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCM2lWePOnw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">irresistible punchy instrumental from a “Haus Labs” promotional video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, had leaked, but the album version is different. This rendition includes pianos, saxophones and a full-blown choir in the chorus, joining Gaga in chanting “Strut it out, walk a mile/Serve it, ancient city style,” reminiscent of the command-like lyrics and beat from Madonna’s “Vogue.” As one enlightened YouTube comment once told me, “You know a Gaga song is good when Madonna fans start to compare the two.” I’ll be honest, I had a hard time subscribing to the idea of the semi-forced wordplay “Gossip, babble on/Battle for your life, Babylon,” but after hearing how good the whole song is, I’ve accepted that it only adds to Gaga’s path of not taking herself or her music too seriously.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94797\" style=\"width: 691px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1569868359\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94795\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94797\" data-attachment-id=\"94797\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/welcome-to-chromatica-lady-gaga-returns-to-her-pop-homeland/lady-gaga-beats1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"681,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"lady-gaga-beats1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94797\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?resize=681%2C383\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?w=681&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94797\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Variety</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three interludes on the album do little more than to shorten the length of it, which is already small (43 minutes for a 16-track album), even though the transition from “Chromatica” to “911” is, in a word, excellent. They do provide a nicely produced sonic palate cleanser between all of the pop explosiveness and separate some of the lyrical ideas from each other. However, my general rule regarding interludes is that if you are not </span><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14271-the-archandroid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janelle Monáe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and able to execute them flawlessly, you should not do them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particularly heavy hitter is “Free Woman,” which is about how Gaga was sexually assaulted by a music producer early in her career. She felt free after she let go of the pain and was able to celebrate, and she sings, “I’m not nothing without a steady hand/I’m not nothing unless I know I can/I’m still something if I don’t got a man/I’m a free woman, oh-oh.” This song is a triumphant return to Gaga’s dance roots, which is most clearly shown through the upbeat dance production and stand-out lyric, “This is my dance floor I fought for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another standout is “Plastic Doll,” a song about conforming to the music industry and being what everyone looks for in a pop star. It’s not a particularly new idea, but Gaga sells it with the strained and pleading lines, “Don’t play with me/It just hurts me.” The over-enunciated (to the point where it’s funny) bridge “Tell me, who dressed you? Where’d you get that hat? Why is she crying? What’s the price tag?/Who’s that girl, Malibu Gaga?/Looks so sad, what is this saga?” takes away from the tension in the song, but cements that Dramatic Gaga is probably the best Gaga.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the album is so pop heavy, something it suffers from is homogeneity, with each song following a pretty similar structure: an instrumental chorus and a reboot of it with added vocals at the end. It can make for a pretty disorienting listen, and some sufferers include “Alice” and “911.” At least on the latter, Gaga tackles some issues regarding the self and fame, leading to interesting lines like “Holdin’ on so tight to this status/It’s not real but I’ll try to grab it/Keep myself in beautiful places/Paradise is in my hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a show-stopping album, but it’s a handful of pop songs with interesting writing about Gaga’s career, personal life, substance use and relationships, along with strong, dynamic instrumental production to back it up. This dance-central album might just provide enough refuge with a bedroom dance party to make us forget we can’t listen to this music at a real party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Album rating: 7/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

From the start, the chat was going wild, first arguing about which of his two films is best and later arguing about whether submitted or live questions should be prioritized. Either way, Aster answered many compelling questions during the event. He is quirky, extremely intelligent and an obviously creative artist, though he looks like more of a Wes Anderson type of guy — not the type to create such personal, dark and twisted films. The enthusiastic hosts first began with some small talk about life in quarantine, and everyone was grateful to hear that Aster has spent it diligently working on new projects. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94755\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2039268341\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94754\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94755\" data-attachment-id=\"94755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-01/a-s-program-board-presents-ask-ari-aster/screen-shot-2020-05-27-at-7-21-13-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=1440%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 7.21.13 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94755\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With introductions out of the way, hosts Esteban Alvarado and Kiyomi Morrison began to ask students’ pre-submitted questions. One of mine was asked in the first 10 minutes: “What inspired you to begin filmmaking in the first place?” to which Aster simply responded, “Movies.” He chuckled and then elaborated, “Loving movies … I’ve always been obsessed with movies and then at a certain point I just wanted to make them. I guess the urge on some level is to have a dialogue with your heroes. You grow up, you love so many films, you love so many filmmakers that you kinda want to engage as deep of a level as you can.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As expected, most of the audience members were film majors, so Aster was asked about his experience at film school. At the American Film Institute, he was able to make “all the mistakes you were eventually going to make anyway” and admitted that he “ripped off everybody … I mean, I’m still ripping off everybody.” The conversation then shifted to his breakout film “Hereditary” from 2018 and “Midsommar,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which was released only one year later in 2019. Aster is regarded as a horror director but instead calls himself a “genre filmmaker.” Although he sees “Hereditary” as a horror film, he doesn’t “even know what ‘Midsommar’ is” and claims that, as the films’ creator, “It’s not even my job to categorize them.” This is true because film genres are made to satisfy viewers, to help marketing teams and to be judged by critics. So even if Aster isn’t strictly a horror movie maker, fans agree that his first two films are creating an exciting and new category of horror, much better than other cheesy contemporary scary movies that Aster perceives as “archaic” and annoying. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to another question about using light instead of relying on darkness to scare viewers in “Midsommar,” Aster expressed that he had “a very specific aesthetic in mind,” and he was never concerned about the movie being scary. He knew the production company, A24, would promote it as a horror movie, which worried him because he anticipated that marketing would “create expectations that the film had no interest in meeting.” His thinking was to make it an “anthropological travelogue” in Sweden, and if anything, he would call it an “existential horror film.” It is a film that is about “codependency,” so when a student asked if the film had a happy ending for its main character Dani, Aster explained that although she escaped a toxic codependent relationship with her boyfriend Christian, she then “found herself in another codependent relationship with the village.” So although the Swedish group or cult was “racist, homicidal” and obsessed with “eugenics,” Dani’s new relationship was “very well functioning” as opposed to the one with Christian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the last half of the interview, the hosts moved on to Aster’s first full-length film “Hereditary,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which like its successor film is about trauma and grief. Many students, both through pre-submitted questions and live chat questions, wanted to dive into Aster’s mind and learn the inspiration behind his complicated family story in “Hereditary.” He explained that the film depicts the “corrosive effects that grief can have on a family dynamic,” and the end can be seen as a metaphor for “trauma completely changing somebody, utterly, and not necessarily for the better.” Toni Collette’s performance was undeniably stunning and chilling, and yet she wasn’t nominated for an Academy Award; one student wondered if Aster believed she was “robbed” of that nomination or if he even cares about the Oscars. After a bit of scoffing at the idea, Aster said he didn’t care; however, he immediately admitted that “when that time of year rolls around, you care, ya know,” especially since his team believed Collette had “a chance,” though he wasn’t expecting anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, both of his films were shut out of any Academy Awards nominations, but one can hope he receives the recognition he deserves for future projects. Aster revealed that he is working on a “nightmare comedy,” having just finished a new draft, and said, “ All I know is that it’s gonna be four hours long, over 17 [years of age].” His production company, Square Peg, is also working on a remake of “Save the Green Planet,” which Aster is excited about because he wanted to know what it means to be a producer, and as a fan of the original film, he knew he wanted to take on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This event was any movie lover’s dream as students were able to pick Aster’s brilliant mind and learn more about the film industry. In the last few minutes of the interview, Aster was asked another one of my questions and gave his advice to aspiring filmmakers: “It’s all very obvious but, I mean, if you want to write, write and finish something,” and if you want to direct, you have to find people and “film it with your phone if you have to.” As an end to the compelling event, Aster gave a shout out to the class of 2020, saying, “This is no way to graduate, but you did it … you don’t go to me for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspiration words, but this is going to be over.” And, since he assumed most attendees were film students, he highlighted the importance of filmmaking, saying, “I don’t know what I would do without movies and TV while I rot in this apartment.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

The dance department does not rely on GauchoSpace the way other departments do, so instructors are figuring out how to use the platform at the same time as their students. “They don’t know what we can see and what they can see, so that’s been rough,” Lousen admits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the unforeseeable global pandemic, all Spring Quarter 2020 productions have had to be canceled or rescheduled, which is disappointing for dancers who have devoted hours of their time each week to rehearsing and perfecting their performances. Even though these shows will not take place as planned, Stewart does not view the past year’s work as wasted time because of relationships she formed with her fellow dancers. “The community, the collaboration, it’s been so inspiring to work with them whether or not we got to perform it.” She also mentions that there is a chance that these performances will see the stage in the future, but everything is still up in the air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year dance major Colson Lynn says that he is making the best of the situation by taking advantage of the abundance of resources found online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so much out in the dance world right now that’s being offered for free. I’m taking classes with a bunch of different choreographers that I never would have had the experience otherwise because they’re all based in New York. Their classes are online and free, so I’ve been motivated to keep practicing by taking something new,” Lynn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between academic classes, rehearsals and performances, dance majors are used to having highly structured schedules, and for third-year dance major Amity Beardsley, the lack of structure to her day has been the most difficult aspect of online classes. “I personally need structure but I prefer when it’s laid out already. It’s been hard to get everything done on my own terms. Honestly, I don’t think I have as much work, but because I have a hard time getting motivated it takes me probably double the amount of time.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to many other majors, where classes are generally rather sedentary, the life of a dance major is defined by physical movement. With the stay-at-home restrictions, the hours spent in front of her laptop are less than ideal, says Lousen. Given the extra time, she makes it a point to explore other classes and activities in order to recalibrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of the obstacles that dance majors have had to navigate, many of them take comfort in knowing that they are a part of a close-knit community where everyone looks out for one another. Second-year dance and psychological &amp; brain sciences major Isabel Meena noted that several dancers formed a group chat called “Movers and Zoomers” once they realized that classes were going to be online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially during this when we’re all kind of struggling at home, it’s been really nice to at least know we can get in class with each other. The first Zoom meeting that we had, where I got to see all my friends’ faces on a computer screen, that’s better than nothing,” says Meena. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s administration has still not decided on how it will approach Fall Quarter 2020 instruction, but Stewart says that the dance department is pushing to get its students back on campus as soon as possible. “Our faculty is incredibly creative, obviously, and they have all these very creative solutions and ways that they could go about keeping us safe but still allowing us to dance.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If classes do not return to in-person instruction for the upcoming school year, however, many students are re-evaluating the decision to pay full tuition for remote instruction and are considering taking fall quarter off. Meena admits that she is not sure if virtual instruction is worth the challenges. “It makes me wonder, if classes end up being online in the fall, if I want to keep doing that to myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of COVID-19, students and faculty have been inspired to come up with creative solutions for what will ultimately just be a bump in the road for the department. In the meantime, these dancers will continue to lean on their passion for their craft as they look forward to hitting the dance floor with each other once again. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

last year on her Dedicated Tour, my main takeaway from our interaction was her kindness. With every meet-and-greet guest, she took the time to chat and made them feel special, like she was grateful for their participation. When someone asked her what superpower she would want in the Q&amp;A session that followed, she replied, “I think to give someone a nice day.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think her generosity is in part why she chose to release “Dedicated Side B,” a collection of unreleased songs from her album “Dedicated,” near the one-year anniversary of her previous album and in the middle of a global pandemic. Some artists have chosen to </span><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9342723/album-releases-postponed-coronavirus-list\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpone their projects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the risky sales impacts the crisis could have, but people like Jepsen see the need for a distraction. She released the album after teasing it for a week on Twitter, saying, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlyraejepsen/status/1263440724747530240\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope it makes yah dance your pants off!”</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of the quarantine album has been taking shape recently during the debate over whether or not music should come out during this time. Dua Lipa moved the release of “Future Nostalgia” up a week, saying that </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiuMO-ZEevo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“we need music, and we need joy.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Weeknd’s recently released album </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-28/in-review-after-hours-by-the-weeknd/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After Hours”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contains the prophetic No. 1 single “Blinding Lights,” released last November, which features the lyrics, “I look around and Sin City’s cold and empty (oh)/No one’s around to judge me (oh).” Charli XCX set out to create a quarantine-centered album,which came to be “How I’m Feeling Now,” a raw and honest account of the daily activities of being locked inside a house all day. “I’m so bored, woo/Wake up late, eat some cereal/Try my best to be physical,” she laments in one of the tracks, “Anthems.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dedicated Side B” is different, though, as it is full of demos from “Dedicated” that didn’t make the cut. Jepsen </span><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8511969/carly-rae-jepsen-dedicated-interview-200-songs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recorded over 200 songs for her last album</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it would have been a pop tragedy if no one in the world got to hear them. Following the tradition of giving fans an album add-on set with “Emotion: Side B,” this collection of 12 songs reveals a little more about Jepsen’s work process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album opens with “This Love Isn’t Crazy,” </span><a href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/carly-rae-jepsen-teases-new-track-maybe-titled-this-love-isnt-crazy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a song teased on her Instagram story in 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which grants me the opportunity to finally listen to it in high quality after coming back to the snippet every so often, hoping it gets released. The track starts with a video-game-like instrumental and an addicting voice box effect over her vocals, and she sings about finally believing that a relationship might not be as far fetched as she initially thought. “That’s why we got to hold on, baby (I know it)/I can believe that this love isn’t crazy (I feel it)/This loving could save me (I know it and I feel it and)/This love isn’t crazy,” she admits over the punchy synth-packed beat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This Is What They Say” is another song about the beginnings of a relationship, where Jepsen says, “We’re on the right track, I can feel it/I came alive, first day that we met,” measuring her love to how everyone else feels the process. It’s like she’s following a tutorial, saying, “I’m doing it well, right?” In this way, she seems so innocent, like every love is her first. “This is what they say/Falling in love is supposed to feel like,” she sings in the chorus. The glitchy instrumental sounds like it takes place in a computer, with Jepsen’s digital love sounding as quirky and effervescent ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jepsen and superstar producer Jack Antonoff link up on “Comeback,” a slow and caring song about a lover fixing Jepsen so she can return to her normal self. It resembles the songs Antonoff worked on for the “Love, Simon” soundtrack that he curated, especially the ‘80s-sounding “Wild Heart.” The pair are a powerful duo on the last chorus, where they belt, “I don’t know what I’m feeling, but I believe/I was thinking about making a comeback, back to me,” showcasing Jepsen’s powerful voice that she usually keeps in reserve (bringing it out on the phenomenal songs “Cut to the Feeling” and “Run Away With Me”). The song grows and expands as it progresses, becoming more lush and vibrant up until the end, where Jepsen fades out, saying, “Come with me/I’m the keeper of that beat/And the fire under your feet/I’m the keeper, man, I’m the keeper.” It’s one of the most special songs Jepsen has ever created.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94640\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"841748839\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94638\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94640\" data-attachment-id=\"94640\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-26/carly-rae-jepsen-releases-new-refined-dedicated-side-b-quarantine-album/carly-rae-jepsen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"carly-rae-jepsen\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94640\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carly-rae-jepsen.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94640\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of OrcaSound</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other standouts include “Summer Love,” a groovy song that reminds me of “I’ll Be Your Girl” on “Dedicated,” “Fake Mona Lisa,” where Jepsen compares a sexual encounter to art and the downtempo and sensual “Heartbeat,” reminiscent of Björk’s “Vespertine” era, with its small, fluttering microbeats. “Solo” is a clever self-empowerment anthem about enjoying your own company, (“So what you’re not in love?/Don’t go wasting your nights getting so low/So what you’re not in love?/You shine bright by yourself dancing solo”) another venture into electronic music for Jepsen (like last year’s “Real Love” and “OMG” with Gryffin).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album ends with “Now I Don’t Hate California After All,” a breezy, atmospheric, Julia Holter-like track about how a new relationship can turn her environment around. Jepsen has alluded to the angst of the California lifestyle before in “LA Hallucinations” (“Planes, I’m hopping/Cards, I’m dropping/No shop can fill me up”) and “Right Words Wrong Time” (“Hate the traffic in LA/I drove through it all to get to you”). Here, Jepsen doesn’t have a turnaround with the state itself, but with someone who makes her forget about the negatives it has to offer. Now, with a new relationship, she’s able to see the good in the place. The chorus goes, “Love on the beach and the tide is high/Ooh, ooh/Moon in the water and the open sky/Ooh, ooh” mixing both where she is and whom she’s with to form this picture of completeness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is a strong selection of pop songs, it is clear that they are B-sides. When looking at both albums, you can see which songs with the same ideas were swapped because one was stronger (“Window” is analogous to “Want You In My Room,” “Solo” to “Party For One” and “Now I Don’t Hate California After All” to “Right Words Wrong Time”). Even though there are overlapping themes in other Jepsen songs and the material isn’t exactly new, there are still some gems in this album that represent the best of her discography.

As part of the Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board’s “Live on the Rise” series, the Los Angeles band SadGirl performed and answered questions on a Zoom livestream this past Wednesday night. The band consists of Lindes, drummer David Ruiz and bassist Dakota Peterson. So far, they have released three EPs and two albums, with “Vol. Two” in 2015 and “Water” just last year. They are a surf punk-rock band that records very romantic songs, and they range from slow dance to violent mosh pit material. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zoom webinar was supposed to be set up so that the band performed for 40 minutes followed by a 20 minute Q&amp;A. But the event began late, and there were many technical problems. While waiting for it to begin, I first watched a black screen and heard the band practicing, which actually got me excited for the virtual performance. After a 10 to 15 minute wait, they began with “Penelope’s Leg,” but the video cut out after a minute, and after fixing that they began the concert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first full song they performed was “Miss Me” and I, like other attendees, imagined I was in a solo show and it was beautiful. Then the sound started to cut out. Lindes was wearing a mask, probably for aesthetic purposes or to help his voice get muffled, but the terrible sound distorted his singing enough already. I couldn’t figure out if it was just my Wi-Fi since the sound was so low and gritty, as if it were being recorded on an iPhone 4; but after a few attendees began to voice their concerns in the chat, I realized everyone had the same problem. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

SadGirl ended the set with their new single, “Learn to Swim.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This latest single was released on May 8, and it continues the band’s water motif from their last album. Although recorded before the quarantine, as one of the hosts pointed out, the song is “ironic” because of how much it relates to the state of the world right now. It seems as if it reflects how everyone is feeling overwhelmed with chaos, and though it feels like “it’s almost over” people need to stay afloat before they drown in worry, echoed by Lindes’ sorrowful but accepting repetition of “guess that I better learn to swim.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two panelists switched off asking questions while Lindes gave most of the responses, since he started off as the only member on the Zoom call. Lindes gave his the tips on how to crowdsurf warning to make sure to “empty your pockets” and look for “one person to catch you” and just go for it. The band was then asked about choosing a piece that defines their style. While it was unanimously decided that, for Peterson, it would have to be his glasses, Lindes’ choice was his iconic van, which was stolen back in November 2019 but thankfully found about a week later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As revealed by Lindes when asked if his year in a U.K. art school influenced the band at all, he first replied with no, but then explained that maybe it did help only because he hated that year. He recalled, “I wanted to come back to LA … and I immediately started, like, working at a screen printing shop and, like, learning more hands-on about design work.” He later said the band itself is a project, so he enjoys being able to work with different art mediums for SadGirl. The panelists then borrowed Pitchfork’s “Over/Under” interview segment in which the band gave their opinion on things like Disneyland, Elon Musk and Dr. Martens and if they are overrated or underrated. After the 40-minute interview with a few student questions sprinkled in, the event ended in an underwhelming way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the event didn’t go according to plan, though events never really do. There were too many technical issues to enjoy the music, which was upsetting for fans who wanted to see SadGirl perform. So even though the amount of time with the Q&amp;A was double the amount of performance time, at least fans were given something they could hear. The majority of questions were interesting, and it’s always good to throw in a few quirky ones, though some were unnecessary or worded in an odd and confusing way. Since it was an untraditional interview, it was easy for the band to get off track, and they basically began to have their own conservations. As a fan I didn’t mind, because though it seemed as if they forgot they were doing a livestream, it was like an inside look at who they really are; since any artist acts differently “onstage” versus speaking with friends, it felt as if we were in their friend group for a moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the conversations with the band were insightful, the interviewers looked a bit uneasy. It seemed as though they wanted to keep everything tight and controlled since they did work hard to put on this event, but their plans fell through from the very beginning. The event was dull and disheartening, but I know how much hard work went into this, from both the A.S. Program Board and SadGirl. So though everyone would’ve preferred an in-person performance, there is no one to blame for the pandemic which has ruined everyone’s plans. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

id=\"caption-attachment-94564\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Elite Daily</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past Tuesday, the king of YouTube himself, David Dobrik, made a virtual appearance on Zoom for an event held exclusively for Gauchos, courtesy of the Associated Students Program Board. During this hour-long conversation, the vlogger intimately discussed his rise to fame, experience as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and what it’s like dealing with crazy fans </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of whom crashed the live session by exposing her bare breast on camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board members Gabriel Reyes and Nathaly Pacheco moderating the discussion, Dobrik was able to answer specific questions of relevance rather than relying on the hectic chat room, which filled up with hundreds of messages by the second. Perhaps one of the things that got so many people excited was the appearance of other beloved vlog squad members who have been with Dobrik since the beginning: Natalie Mariduena and Ilya Fedorovich. Both Mariduena and Fedorovich grew up alongside Dobrik in Chicago, Ill., and now live with him in their shared mansion in Los Angeles, Calif. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jumping right in, moderator Reyes asked Dobrik what the first thing is that he wants to do once this COVID-19 quarantine ends. Known for capturing both his and his friends’ antics on YouTube, were any of us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surprised when Dobrik replied with, “Probably go to the bars. I miss seeing my friends drink in public places”? Of course, after earning a laugh, Dobrik quickly followed this up with a more serious answer, explaining that he’s simply excited to get back to work.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing the conversation, Dobrik talked about his social media consumption, claiming that he’s got a special place in his heart for one app in particular: “I am probably the biggest fan of TikTok, and I hate saying this because I sound like I’m some sort of hipster, but I promise you, I was using it before it was cool.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As moderator Pacheco moved the discussion from TikTok to Dobrik’s YouTube career, Dobrik emphasized how important the element of stress was during his rise to internet fame. Although he claimed that his original schedule of posting vlogs three times a week got difficult to keep up with, the stress that came along with it ended up being the perfect amount of fire he needed to become the sensation he is today. “Moral of the story is, if you’re stressed out, keep going,” Dobrik said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, things got fun and lighthearted again as Reyes asked if Dobrik could show everyone his infamous </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliemachadoo/status/1262958639427416064\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flamethrower</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a gadget often used in his more daring vlogs. While we may have been happy with just seeing the instrument itself, Dobrik took it a step further and instantly put it to use (and, honestly, I was genuinely worried he might accidentally burn his house down). The gag was over in seconds, with Pacheco commenting, “I don’t think [the Zoom viewers] thought you’d actually do it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his meteoric rise in popularity, it’s no surprise that Dobrik often faces fanatic subscribers, who apparently show up at his doorstep quite frequently. “People show up to the house, and it’s so fucking scary. We hate it,” Dobrik said. While some experiences are more pleasant than others, like the time Dobrik ran into a guy who ended up playing John B in the recent Netflix series “Outer Banks,” Dobrik said that most of the time, it’s just downright uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of his most “memorable” fan encounters (and I say “memorable” with a grain of salt), Dobrik explained how every fan “thinks they’re the exception” when they show up to his home uninvited. One fan in particular, Dobrik explained, showed up to his house claiming that he needed to show Dobrik a video </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a video on how this man found out where Dobrik lives, how he followed Dobrik home from a party and so on. “Those situations are pretty sad and scary,” Dobrik said. “Once in a while, people just show up, and we think it’s our time to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about DACA and his current view on the political landscape, Dobrik explained how he wants his YouTube channel to be an escape from the hectic world outside the internet and not a place where his audience feels divided. “This sounds so cheesy, but it’s so true,” he said. “I just want [my channel] to be a place where people can just watch videos and forget what’s actually going on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrik then recalled an instance when he was in Texas and met a number of students who are part of the DACA program, explaining how frustrating it was to see “everyday” people having to struggle when they contribute so much to society. As a DACA recipient himself, Dobrik said, “I have high hopes for all DACA people.” Although he kept his answers on these serious subjects somewhat short, it was clear Dobrik had much more to say.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the event, moderator Reyes added that his housemates (who are huge Dobrik fans) were all watching the livestream in a separate room. To this, Dobrik invited them to come join Reyes, where soon after, one of the housemates immediately pulled up her sweater to reveal her naked breast to Dobrik and everyone else watching at home. While most got a laugh from it, a few people on </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateGatsby/status/1263026527769251841\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> questioned the appropriateness of this act, wondering if it still would have been perceived as funny if it had instead been a man exposing himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this livestream was filled with several unforeseeable moments, Dobrik accomplished something great: He brought laughter and entertainment to an audience stuck at home during one of the craziest times any of us have had to face thus far. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

living rooms this past Sunday night for a one-and-a-half-hour-long live set streamed straight from his Las Vegas mansion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courtesy of the Associated Students Program Board, the Dim Mak label head appeared over Zoom to perform an eclectic mix from his extensive EDM repertoire, playing some fan favorites as well as reaching deeper into his catalog. Dressed in a white t-shirt and bright orange shorts, with a pair of headphones over his signature long locks, Aoki wasted no time in amping up the atmosphere (virtually, of course). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up with “I Love My Friends” from his latest album “Neon Future IV,” Aoki gave a quick shoutout to his alma mater as he animatedly jumped up and down behind his turntable. Preferring to let the music speak for itself, Aoki had little to say throughout his set, but he more than made up for it with his vibrant and high-impact performance. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grammy-nominated producer cycled through tracks as he danced in front of rotating neon visuals, determined not to let the energy die down. Spinning mixes for hits such as “Waste It On Me,” his collaboration with BTS, and “Azukita,” featuring vocals from Daddy Yankee and  Elvis Crespo, Aoki picked up the mic every once in a while to let out a low, “UCSB!” Aoki also promoted songs from his most recent project, including “New Blood,” featuring Sydney Sierota from Echosmith, as well as the Zooey Deschanel-assisted “1 4 U.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The free, Gauchos-only event encouraged audience participation as listeners lit up the Zoom chat, unreserved in their elation and admiration for Aoki. The comments ranged from “Steve’s birthday should be a school holiday” to “This feels like a fever dream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live set was followed by a Q&amp;A, where the UC Santa Barbara alumnus shared how he was spending his quarantine (self-care, reading and chess), reminisced about his college experience and discussed his journey to becoming one of the world’s most recognized DJs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Aoki is one of the school’s most notable alumni, he admits that his first choice for college was UC Irvine, which is close to his hometown of Newport Beach. “In all honesty, it was the only UC school that accepted me,” Aoki said of UC Santa Barbara. “I don’t even know how I got in, I’ll be honest with you. I applied to every UC school, I applied to all of them. I got rejection, rejection, rejection, rejection, rejection. UCSB was the only one that accepted me, I don’t know why.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, the feminist studies and sociology double major has nothing but fond memories of Isla Vista, where he spent seven years of his life. “People didn’t want to leave. People didn’t want to grow up, face reality,” Aoki said. “I had a good core of friends, I was in a few different recreational groups. I was in the anime club, so we’d go and watch anime at one of the halls. A bunch of nerds, serious geeks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> me included.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a viewer who asked if he had any advice for up-and-coming DJs of Asian descent, Aoki acknowledged the struggles he faced early in his career. “There is definitely racism in the music industry, period. It’s more subliminal, it comes disguised,” he said. Later, Aoki revealed that he does not consider himself to be a talented person and compensates for it by spending extra hours in the studio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I need to think outside the box, or else they’re not going to notice what I’m doing. It’s all in the connection and the interest to share with other people. If you look at the lineup of popular DJs, it’s very rare to see an Asian face, let alone a female face … so the one thing I can say is, to all the Asians that are listening, all the women that are listening: You guys can fill in that space </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you just have to create and share.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

With the most legendary people to ever play the game, the cast was an obvious strength of the season.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pre-merge focused on old school versus new school, with many older players like Boatwright, Ethan Zohn, Parvati Shallow and Yul Kwon unfortunately being picked off. After the merge, everything centered on big threats versus little threats and lions versus hyenas, as said by Vlachos. In a season of winners, everyone was a threat to grab the crown, but some were such dominating winners that they knew they were threats. People like Vlachos, Ben Driebergen, Jeremy Collins and Tyson Apostol needed each other to protect themselves from hyenas and people like Clarke, Nick Wilson and Spradlin-Wolfe who were sneaky, strategic and under the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gameplay this season was intense and extremely fast paced. One fantastic move was Denise Stapley single-handedly voting out Diaz-Twine (thus dubbing her the “Queen slayer”) using a hidden immunity idol that Diaz-Twine had given to her. This took guts and moved Stapley up from the “lower-threat” position she was in before. At the merge feast, she described the move, maybe leaking too much information. Clarke picked up on this, saying that “it just made her look really good. But I have to imagine everybody at the table thought, ‘Hmm, like, one person has a resume out here, good to know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final nine, Vlachos brilliantly blindsided Clarke in a 4-3-2 vote, an extremely rare shake-up. Unsure if Collins had an idol to save himself, the majority alliance of Clarke, Sarah Lacina, Driebergen, Wilson and Vlachos decided to split the vote between Collins and Fitzgerald. Spradlin-Wolfe and Stapley saw this as a good opportunity to get rid of a threat and joined them. Spradlin-Wolfe, one of the most intuitive people to play the game, said, “I think Tony is trying to play double agent … I feel like Tony is my biggest enemy out here right now.” She was proven correct when Vlachos flipped, bringing Wilson, Fitzgerald and Collins together to vote for Clarke, who went home with an idol in her pocket. It was an unfortunate ending but a major win for Tony.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recency bias be damned, I like Wilson, even though he did the opposite of what I wanted many times, like voting out Clarke, Kwon and Spradlin-Wolfe. He also voted out Shallow, his high school crush (and my personal all-time favorite player), when he could’ve easily swung the vote to Wendell Holland and shaken things up. That takes a lot of nerve to do, and if I were on the island with Shallow, I don’t think I would ever write her name down, as it goes against my beliefs as a Shallow fan (the main one being that she should have won “Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains”). I wouldn’t win the game, but at least we’d be friends, and that’s what really matters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With good moves come bad moves, and Driebergen’s decision to allow himself to be voted out at the final five so Lacina (who ended up not even making it to the end) could pad her resume was probably the worst. I just know </span><a href=\"https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/survivor-35-finale-chrissy-hofbeck-ben-driebergen-twist-news/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrissy Hofbeck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was jumping out of her seat when Driebergen literally gave up his game to make a friend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After critics panned “Survivor: South Pacific” for having a below-average cast, I was glad that  Clarke returned to the game and proved she was a great winner. She played a smart under-the-radar game; “Survivor” host Jeff Probst said, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eeidwtQT_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“so many times you forget she’s there. She’s really good at that.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She was so invisible that Apostol forgot her name in one confessional when listing players: “People like Wendell, Nick, Yul, and … I don’t even know who the last one is. Sophie. So under the radar that I did not even know her name.” In the same episode, he was voted out. Sophie voodoo is real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season was a trial run for fire tokens, an in-game currency that allows people to buy advantages. As a whole, I didn’t think they served much purpose other than to give more screen time to the “Edge of Extinction,” but at least it was an interesting concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ill-fated and fan-hated “Edge of Extinction” returned, the theme from two seasons ago that allowed eliminated players to stay and starve in “Survivor” purgatory, with two chances to get back into the game. After being voted out first, Anderson returned to the game at the final six.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anderson </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the “Edge of Extinction.” She found advantages, disadvantages and completed all the required grueling tasks, like running around the island 20 times (on very little food, which was a theme of the Edge). She, along with Shallow as a buddy, ended up collecting so many fire tokens that she bought three advantages: a jar of peanut butter and an immunity idol. “I’ve been grinding slowly and quietly for so long, but all this hard work is worth it,” Anderson said, moments before winning her way back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She connected with Fitzgerald, who was at the bottom of the pack, and they picked off the rest of the contestants and made their way into the finals. It’s always good to watch an underdog story; every time I counted Fitzgerald out of the running, she proved me wrong. She’s now the only contestant to play multiple seasons of “Survivor” without ever being voted out (excluding leaving early). Fitzgerald played a scrappy game, winning two immunity challenges and finding advantages, and in any other season, she would’ve gotten some votes. However, this came down to a race between Vlachos and Anderson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final tribal council, Anderson pulled out her CVS receipt-length list of every advantage she had found and used in the game </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extorting Vlachos into giving her six tokens, sending a challenge advantage to Wilson, giving a tribal council advantage to Collins </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was commended on her dominant game in the Edge. However, she was criticized for not playing as hard once she got back into the game, unlike Chris Underwood, the winner of the first “Edge of Extinction” season. She ultimately played a good game, but it was no match against Vlachos’ dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting voted out second on “Survivor: Game Changers” three years ago, Vlachos had work to do. He edited his intense strategy of finding idols down to playing it safe in the beginning and letting people form a new impression of him. “I want everyone to get nice and comfortable with me; their guards are here right now [putting their arms up], and they’re slowly coming down … When it gets down to here, BANG! [punches] That’s when the sucker punch comes in,” he said in the very first episode. He held true to his words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, he was quiet and unassuming and then later got to work. Along with finding idols and advantages, he proved his social game when he convinced Collins, Wilson and Driebergen each to give him a fire token. He won four individual immunity challenges, something he had never accomplished in his original season, constantly worked with people on opposing alliances to get himself further and rekindled his and Lacina’s “Cops-R-Us” duo. It got him to the end, where his aggressive strategy deemed him worthy of getting the grand prize. The </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SandraDTwine/status/1260766588996902912\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queen stays queen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but “Survivor” crowned a new king.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season provided memorable moments, funny interactions and great gameplay to go with a fantastic cast. My favorite moments included Spradlin-Wolfe begging people to talk to her, Vlachos and Collins arguing over what a week was, Adam Klein trying desperately to play a decoration on the voting stand as an idol, the “Sandra Bench” and the all-inclusive family visit that ended with a giant thank-you hug to Probst. Shallow described the season as “a fan’s dream” in an interview, and I’m so glad I was not disappointed. Might this season be the best one ever? We’ll need some time away from it to decide, but I think it’s one of the best in some time.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-94415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the quarantine, you may think you’ve watched every show possible, but Netflix’s “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the best new series that you probably don’t even know exists. Due to its lack of advertisement, this revolutionary and unapologetically unique show remains relatively obscure, and even more than a month after its release it is still deprived of the popular buzz it deserves. “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is based on a 2012 memoir by Deborah Feldman, “Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.” It follows a 19-year-old girl named Esther Schapiro, otherwise known as Esty, played by star Shira Haas, a 24-year-old Israeli actress who is already famous in Israeli cinema and television but has found new international fame with this series. Esty, like Feldman, escapes her highly secluded and heavily regulated Hasidic Jewish community. More specifically, Esty belongs to the Satmar community in Brooklyn, New York, and she flees to Berlin, Germany to escape the strict and limited lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As revealed in the 21-minute documentary, “Making</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unorthodox,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also on Netflix</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Satmar community is originally from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Szatmárnémeti</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hungary, and was created by descendants of Holocaust survivors in New York post-WWII. Their native language is Yiddish, and because the creators wanted to get every detail right, some actors who didn’t speak Yiddish had to learn the language for the show. As all Hasidic Jewish sects, the Satmar community interprets the Torah literally and follows very traditional rules. Both men and women dress very modestly and marry young, but women are especially protected from the outside world. They do not have access to higher education, they are forbidden from showing their hair and their main purpose in life is to bear children. As Esty describes in the show, they must rebuild the six million Jewish lives lost in the Holocaust.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escaping the community is nearly impossible, and even after it’s accomplished, members hunt down the runaways and try to coerce them into returning. It is essential that no Jew loses their way, so after Esty flees Brooklyn, her husband Yakov Schapiro, otherwise known as Yanky, and his cousin Moishe Lefkovitch follow her. Her arrival in Germany marks the second half of her story, and the producers disclose that the first half of the limited series closely portrays Feldman’s life, but the second half is entirely made up. Esty arrives in Berlin and quickly finds a group of friends who are all students at a prestigious music conservatory, and she sets her heart on winning an almost-unobtainable scholarship to the school. Location in this series is very important because a young Jewish girl going to Germany seems nonsensical, but is it there that Esty can truly find herself, and it brings history into a full circle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Haas described in “Making Unorthodox,” I agree that the show isn’t “a story about the existence of God or something like that. It’s more about the right to have your own voice.” “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes us into a fascinating and widely unknown community, and though it is scripted, it gives viewers a raw, never-before-seen insight into the private lives of Hasidic Jews. Esty was always told and always knew that she was different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she even warned Yanky before their arranged marriage. I believe that she will always have a certain level of respect and love for her upbringing, but she knew she could not live like that forever. She knew that she had to shed her roots to gain freedom. The show is only four episodes long, and when I realized that I couldn’t press “next episode,” I threw a fit. It ends with Esty’s audition, and the outcome of her acceptance to the music school that is so crucial to her remaining in Germany is unknown. I wouldn’t say the final episode ends on a cliffhanger, but it did leave me yearning for more, and made me want to run away to Berlin for no reason at all. There is no confirmed season two yet, but Feldman does have a sequel to her book called “Exodus: A Memoir,” so we can only hope for more of Esty since this series’ length was greatly disappointing. As Feldman explained, the general public doesn’t know much about Hasidic Jews, but they do know “the essence of what’s happening, that’s what’s universally understood.” The essence is finding individual freedom, finding your own community and finding where you belong, even if it means sacrificing everything. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 4.5/5</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

id=\"caption-attachment-94383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of IMDb</p></div>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warning! Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be fooled by the title. While “Never Have I Ever” may sound like an otherwise banal and dry teen show from the name, the show presents so much more for the representation of women of color in television and a fresh realistic storyline for a culturally diverse audience. Each episode’s title is clever, as it starts with “Never Have I Ever” and ends in a hint as to what tumultuous conflict will come to fruition in the next episode. As a half-Indian viewer, I was intrigued to see how the show would represent Indian culture — particularly Indian stereotypes that have </span><a href=\"https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/198683\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pervaded media culture in the past</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Would this show extend beyond the nerd stereotypes that suffuse Indian culture? The answer is not simple, but one that is craftily developed by popular Indian-American creator Mindy Kaling, who based the show loosely on her own childhood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pilot season consists of 10 thirty-minute episodes, which turned out to be a good condition for a five-hour binge-fest on my sofa. The show is definitely geared toward younger audiences, as the characters are all in high school and the plot revolves largely around a teen romance between 15-year-old main character Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet). While this seems like an otherwise familiar coming-of-age storyline, the show challenges the topic of lust based purely on attraction, something refreshing to see in a young-adult comedy. The conversation about Devi’s impending loss of virginity is thrown into disarray between Devi’s own inner-reluctance and constant surveillance from Devi’s mom (Poorna Jagannathan). While this comedic element consumes the plot, other dilemmas in the show confront grief in the loss of Devi’s father, her sudden paralysis and the comeback into her sophomore year with her two best friends Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez). </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramakrishnan’s breakout performance as Devi brings a unique spark to the show, as her wit, intelligence and humor are coupled with her endless deflection of the loss of her father, until she reaches an emotional break. Her sought-after vision is to live a normal teenage life, which is disrupted by the harsh parenting of her mother, which allows Indian viewers to relate to the strict but loving parenting style of Indian parents. However, Devi’s mother proves to be a multi-dimensional character as well, whose choices are understandable from her own emotional trauma. Devi’s life events are humorously and uniquely narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe, which might seem odd at first, but is later justified in the show’s storyline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable characters include Devi’s goody-two-shoes cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), who is portrayed as the “beautiful” and “innocent” member of the family, a doctorate student at CalTech who is hesitantly preparing for an arranged marriage. While Devi is constantly sparring with her family, she soon realizes that her rejection of Indian cultural norms is something she shares with Kamala, more than she may initially realize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her wealthy academic competitor Ben (Jaren Lewison) is originally depicted as an antagonist who will do anything to one-up Devi, but a character who sweetly turns out to be one of Devi’s greatest allies and who faces adolescent battles of his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devi’s best friends Eleanor and Fabiola rightfully get their own minor storylines, weaved in seamlessly to the challenges high schoolers face in regards to family and sexuality. These plot points sometimes clash with Devi’s own self-absorbed attitude, which contributes to major highs and lows in their collective friendship. In a way, the show serves as an enlightening awakening in each of the three friend’s lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Indian culture, “Never Have I Ever” may have some eye-roll moments for Indian audiences, especially in the reference of Priyanka Chopra as the epitome of “Indian beauty” multiple times in the series. Similarly, the characterization of Devi as the stereotypical sexually undesirable geek is a bit tiresome to see in such a diverse show. However, the charming moments present in the series definitely outweigh the Indian-American references crafted to appeal to the Americanized gaze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Never Have I Ever” may westernize some elements of Indian culture but stands out in its portrayal of its main character: Devi adapts from an insecure high school teenager to a bold and risk-taking young adult. Devi’s ethnic background is an essential part of the show in how it shapes Devi’s shifting attitudes and uprise against omnipresent tradition. The show applies truthful elements of malicious behavior that stem from growing up and confronting our own inner demons, whether it’s an absent family in Ben’s case or the acceptance of loss in Devi’s. The series ends on an enlivening note in the neglect of fulfilling a perfect teenage fantasy in favor of growing to accept the reality of what makes us happy in our individual lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

amateur,” and one </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night, the UC Santa Barbara student body was able to see history being made. Courtesy of the Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board, students could pull out their paintbrushes while watching a one-of-a-kind Q&amp;A art tutorial. And who is the man behind it all? We’ve all heard of Pablo Picasso, gazed at the works of Leonardo da Vinci and, hell, we’ve even watched Bob Ross, but now we’ve experienced Miles McCollum, more famously known as Lil Yachty, craft masterpieces effortlessly from the comfort of his shoe closet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just a short one-hour debut via a Zoom webinar, Yachty opened up to eager </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listeners about all aspects of his life, answering question after question from the A.S. Program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board and the UCSB student body. Decked out in a red beret and an eccentric rainbow sweater-shirt, Yachty teetered a blank canvas on an easel, all the while seamlessly keeping up with the conversation. Using his MacBook as a ruler, he invited the crowd to create lines with him. And, spoiler alert, these lines became a series of one-dimensional squares, despite the Q&amp;A being anything but one-dimensional.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interviewers were eager to hear about Yachty’s rise to fame in 2016.

But more important for him than any rapper or musician, Yachty gushed about his mother being his greatest inspiration of all. Not only did his mother work two jobs to support him and his sister, but she encouraged both of her children to follow their dreams. “I well overpaid her,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how did Yachty’s ship sail from being a college student to a well-known musical mogul? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He brought us back to a time when he worked at both McDonald’s and Six Flags, stating vividly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that they “fucking sucked,” and he was ecstatic to get out of there. Between going to college and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making a new plan altogether, well, he did both, leaving college after a year to pursue a career in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">music. His father, Shannon McCollum, who is a dignified photographer, would tell Yachty </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stories about his encounters with the rich and famous backstage. Looking to be successful, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty figured he had a shot at being a musician, too.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94377\" style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"547971027\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94377\" data-attachment-id=\"94377\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/lil-yachty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=1200%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lil-Yachty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=888%2C539&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-94377\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=764%2C464\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94377\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Urban Islandz</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now painting his fourth somewhat symmetrical square, Yachty encouraged everyone to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work hard, even to the point of failure, in order to follow their dreams. Once an avid credit card scammer, Yachty pointed out that as fun as it was, he needed to do something more </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distinguished — and not illegal. He even holds himself to a certain standard. “I don’t drink, I never drunk in my life,” he said to the camera. His reasoning? He believes drunk driving will end badly (which it will) and ruin whatever someone has going for them in life. Quite a fair message, especially given his audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he became disgruntled by his artwork, referring to it as “the jankiest bitch,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty made sure to promote uniqueness and creativity, particularly in the music industry. “People respect originality so much,” he said. In an ode to 21 Savage, Yachty applauded the rapper’s use of murder in his songs, just because it was shocking and new.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently everyone is different for a reason, so owning your uniqueness is crucial. But having the newest sound or most outrageous lyrics are not the only things to bring you to fame. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist told us that he used to sleep on A$AP Rocky’s floor and even ran his errands just to be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">associated with him. In his case, it worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to the up and coming, Yachty rolled names off his tongue of talent that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shouldn’t be slept on. He said Duwap Kaine and Cody Miles are both really “dope.” In terms of his own music, Yachty teased the idea that he will be working with Joji, which excited his fans who had watched their conversation on 88rising’s YouTube channel. With new music coming our way, it was no surprise that “Act Up” by City Girls was mentioned since he wrote the entire song himself. Between eye rolls, he told the crowd he thinks City Girls are “very themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting a deep maroon square near the top of his canvas, Yachty listened as the interviewers brought up his infamous crimson dreads that made his image. Now letting his hair grow out sans bleaching and coloring, Yachty told the students that his hair fell out from over-processing it, which apparently he’s never told people before. The fans made do with the red beret he sported for the time being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And food: Now what could be more enticing than that? Yachty prides himself on never having eaten vegetables, instead opting for a slice of glorious pizza. Every. Single. Day. Sounds like some of us college kids, doesn’t it? When venturing to LA, he enjoys the local shop, Delicious Pizza, which is surprising because he claims to “never eat out, ever.” But in the future, he hopes to open his own pizza joint in Atlanta, so he can enjoy his “cheesy” habits and share them with the world, too (and, for the record, his dining choices have no effect on his flawless skin, which he claims to inherit from his parents).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Near the end of the Friday painting questionnaire, the million-dollar question popped up: so, why the name “Lil Yachty?” A group of people in school called themselves the “Yacht Club,” and when McCollum joined, he was the youngest, or the “littlest.” And from there, he was Lil Yachty (shoutout Lil Boat!). Currently, when he isn’t giving art tutorials to bored and quarantined college kids, Yachty is working tirelessly on his new album. Featuring female artists on the tracks, it’s sure to be one for the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finishing off his eight-square masterpiece, Yachty let us in on his love life. While children are definitely a must for him, to this day, he has never been in love — or heartbroken, for that matter. “I haven’t found the right person to create a person with,” he said to the anticipating listeners. And on the familial note, he let us all know he has no plans for Mother’s Day since his mother is hooked up to his bank account. “Every day is Mother’s Day for my mom,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to close out the hour-long endeavor, Yachty gave a simple yet heartfelt shoutout to the class of 2020 as they graduate with great success. Oh, and that painting, if you were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of such glory, will be signed and sent to our very own UCSB, to either hang in the UCen or be given to a gracious student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While COVID-19 pissed on the much-anticipated Deltopian bonfire, the A.S. Program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board did not neglect to bring Yachty’s charm to the UCSB students. No Zoom class will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever be quite as entertaining, or maybe even as educational, as this past Friday night’s Yachty art expo.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hgeorge/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah George</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah George is an Artsweek writer for the Daily Nexus.
