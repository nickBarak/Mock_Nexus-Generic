His newest film “Da 5 Bloods” is extremely political, and like his other films, focuses on Black struggles and oppression. Any history buff would enjoy it, but I recommend the film to everyone because the issues examined in it are unfortunately still prevalent today; especially right now with the new wave of the Black Lives Matter movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 5 Bloods are a group of five black men who were sent to fight for America during the Vietnam War. The film focuses on Paul (Delroy Lindo), Paul’s son David (Jonathan Majors), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Witlock Jr.), and Norman (Chadwick Boseman). The film opens with a clip of Muhammad Ali, who famously condemned the killings of people abroad because unlike the United States, those countries “never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality.” This starts a montage overlapped with Marvin Gaye’s voice, which is the first time of many he is heard in the film. There are clips of Black soldiers, war scenes and historical moments that happened around the time of the war, which was fought from 1955 to 1975. Then, there are photo inserts of Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis and Malcolm X, whose speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie, along with references to Black riots in response to injustices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Netflix preview I got the impression that the film was going to be primarily set during the Vietnam War, but instead it focused on the Bloods during modern-day America, and their time in the war was only briefly shown through flashbacks. Norman was killed during the war, so the other four Bloods return to Vietnam to find his body and the gold they buried about 40 years prior. One of Spike Lee’s most interesting cinematographic choices was to film the flashbacks with the same older actors that portray the four Bloods as in the present-day plot, instead of using younger ones in their place. In my opinion, this was a better choice because the four men were recalling their time in Vietnam and all were able to see themselves as the age they are, but they only remember Norman as young. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire journey in Vietnam brings back memories of the torture that the Bloods went through when they were young soldiers. They show symptoms of the PTSD they still experience, and though they seem proud to call themselves Americans, they also express the disgusting oppression they’ve been subjected to their entire lives. The war is also constantly referred to as the “American War” by the Vietnamese people, who still hold resentment towards the U.S. Yet, both sides show bitterness to each other still to this day; and as the Bloods’ tour guide discloses, “After you’ve been in a war, you understand it never really ends,” which the audience sees through the Blood’s own nervous breakdowns and in tense moments between them and Vietnamese locals who claim the men killed their families. Paul specifically becomes livid at the locals’ statements, and it is only at the end through his visions of Norman that he is able to own up to the truth of his corrupt time in the military. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Norman wasn’t only one of the 5 Bloods but also their leader, teacher and preacher. Otis explained he gave the bloods “Something to believe in. A direction, a purpose. He taught us about Black history when it wasn’t really popular back then… Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.” Norman emphasized peace and justice but wasn’t afraid to show his frustration with the treatment of Black people in America, and who better to have as the heroic idol of the group than the Black Panther himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one of his many teachings, Norman stressed that “War is about money. Money is about war. Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it’s some police state. I can feel just how much I ain’t worth.” Black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a country that was not fighting for them. They were fighting for the rights that they weren’t yet granted, and they were sent to die. Black and brown men disproportionately died during the war, because they were disproportionately sent. As Otis explains to Paul’s young son David, “White boys who stayed in college, they’d dodge that shit. They put our poor Black asses on the front lines, killing us off like flies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Da 5 Bloods” deals with emotional trauma caused because of the war, trust issues, complex relationships with fathers and the many and seemingly never-ending injustices experienced by Black people in America. While not my favorite Spike Lee movie, it was still an enjoyable and beneficial watch. The film takes a different approach to Vietnam War films, most of which focus on the hardships of white soldiers and may portray one token Black actor. They too often ignore and erase the Black men who were thrown into an unjust war and died for a country that didn’t care about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film reflects on how little change has happened since the Vietnam War, and how Black people in America still have to worry about losing their lives and lack of full rights every single day. Justice is slow, and because of that many of us get burnt out and discouraged, but we must continue to fight for our rights. Part of Netflix’s new Black Lives Matter category, the release date of “Da 5 Bloods” couldn’t have been at a more fitting time, and watching films that address systemic racism still prevalent in American society is a great way of educating yourself about Black issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3.5/5 </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

(The special can be accessed on Netflix’s YouTube channel, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4&amp;t=6s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special comes in the wake of nationwide and worldwide protests denouncing the murder of George Floyd and police brutality and systemic racism against Black Americans as a whole, with renewed calls for justice for Black Americans who have lost their lives to police officers that engaged in excessive behavior. It also comes in the middle of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the first few shots showing temperature checks being conducted at the door and socially distanced seating at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special begins with Chappelle recounting his experience with the Northridge Earthquake, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the San Fernando Valley region back in 1994. He recalls the tremors lasting about 35 seconds, and even for such a seemingly short time, he thought he might die, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of his life. It becomes harrowing, then, to try to imagine what George Floyd went through in the eight minutes and forty-six seconds that preceded his death. More so, Chappelle uses the moment to raise questions about what an incident like this — an almost nine-minute long murder in broad daylight with multiple bystanders — says about a society in which a man could do that do another man and “not feel like he was going to get the wrath of God.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Chappelle, the riots and protests engulfing the nation and world right now have been a long time coming. He responds to criticism from Don Lemon, a commentator for CNN, who asked why more celebrities haven’t been speaking out, to which Chappelle questions the very need to look to (often </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/celebrities-racism-i-take-responsibility-video.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clueless</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) celebrities for leadership, observing that “the streets are speaking for themselves right now.” He also responds to Black conservative firebrand Candace Owens, who released a video refusing to embrace George Floyd, a convicted criminal, as a martyr or hero for Black America. Chappelle angrily counters, stating that he does not care what George Floyd did. George Floyd was simply the man that this grave injustice was committed against, and that is why his name is in the papers. He remarks, in one of the more poignant moments of the show, “we aren’t desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n***a that makes it through this nightmare is my goddamned hero.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worth noting here is that this is far from the typical material in Chappelle’s standup, yet does perhaps the best job of all his material at communicating how Dave Chappelle, a Black American, feels about the world he has to face every day. With over 24 million views at the time of writing, it’s also a clear symbol of how much people trust and respect his voice. As someone used to seeing aggressive polarization at every turn of the world, it was genuinely astonishing for me to see neither Don Lemon nor Candace Owens get very defensive over the jokes, and actually independently express their honor and joy at being memorialized in a Dave Chappelle special and to reiterate their belief that he is one of the greatest comedians of all time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of trust is rare, to say the least, and doesn’t seem to be something Chappelle takes for granted. He explores this in the special, recognizing that people seem to trust him because the realness of his jokes make people feel like he’s not lying to them. Yet, he points out, every institution that the people are supposed to trust, from the police to the government, lies to them on almost every level. He ponders the idea that maybe it’s time we figured out better voices to listen to and found better ways to get people to listen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty incredible to see Chappelle pack in this many emotions, jokes and meaningful moments of social commentary into a comedy special that clocks in at a little under 30 minutes. If you’ve seen Chappelle’s old specials tackling the material of police brutality (his 2000 special “Killin’ Them Softly” is hilarious and outstanding), it’s really interesting to view “8:46” as a mature conclusion to those same ideas. Rather than adding to his arsenal of jokes on the topic, this special more somberly lays out his grief at the repeated injustices that Black Americans have to live their entire lives in fear of being victims of. Approaching the topic with a unique combination of sensitivity, moments of light-heartedness and hurt resignation, “8:46” makes for some of Chappelle’s most profound social commentary yet. In today’s cascade of conflicting and angry voices, I think his views are, at the very least, a perspective to deeply consider, regardless of your political views.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 9.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/","id":6262,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6261,6260,6259],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“The King of Staten Island” Is Exactly What You Think It Is","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2020-06-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/king-of-staten-island-e1591991724837.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/king-of-staten-island-e1591991724837.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In true Davidson fashion, “The King of Staten Island” tackles serious issues with abrasive sarcasm and laugh-out-loud one-liners.

Spoilers ahead. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judd Apatow has long found his niche in Hollywood with films that drive their lovable yet woefully aimless protagonists to take a hard look in the mirror, with a dramatic transformation often materializing right before they hit rock bottom. With his latest comedic venture, “The King of Staten Island,” the director trades in his signature smutty jokes and raunchy shticks (think “Knocked Up” or “The 40-Year-Old Virgin”) for a more down-to-earth approach to themes of grief, ambition and self-worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is a clear departure from what audiences have come to associate with Apatow, as he taps Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson for a loosely based retelling of the stand-up comedian’s upbringing in the New York City borough of Staten Island. If you’re watching the movie as an invested fan of Davidson’s or are committed to watching any and all Apatow films, the 137-minute runtime may not be a big deal. When the dust settles, however, “The King of Staten Island” amounts to more or less what you would expect from an Apatow-Davidson collaboration: a subliminally funny yet at-times sluggish plot that milks Davidson’s life story for all it is worth. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson stars as Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old high school dropout who lives at home in Staten Island with his widowed mother Margie (Marisa Tomei), and his younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow), who is about to leave for college. Scott, who has never fully recovered from the sudden death of his father when he was seven, openly embraces his miserable existence and tendency to inflict pain on himself as he proceeds to wreck every personal relationship in his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott’s unresolved sense of loss surrounding his father’s passing, a fireman who was killed in a hotel fire, draws from Davidson’s own experience losing his father, a fireman who perished in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. For the past 17 years, Scott’s life has effectively been paralyzed, which he is acutely aware of yet comfortable ignoring. He passes the time  — perpetually high — by lazing around with his friends and hooking up with a girl named Kelsey (Bel Powley), who desperately wants to take their relationship to the next level while Scott is determined to keep things the same. His one and only aspiration is to open a restaurant which doubles as a tattoo parlor, to be named “Ruby Tattoos-days.” (With ink covering pretty much every inch of his body from the neck down, Scott claims that the pain of the needle relaxes him.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his mother starts to date another fireman named Ray Bishop (Bill Burr), who is incidentally the father of a little boy who Scott tries to tattoo in a park, Scott sees this as the ultimate act of betrayal against his deceased father and does everything in his power to break up the two. His mother, who finally wakes up to the fact that her son is a grown man who has been coddled for far too long, kicks Scott out of the house until he is better equipped to deal with his problems. Scott finds refuge in an unlikely place: the firehouse where Ray works, where Scott learns more about his father and about sustaining the relationships that matter to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In true Davidson fashion, “The King of Staten Island” tackles Scott’s serious underlying issues with abrasive sarcasm and laugh-out-loud one-liners, and it is his charming knack for self-deprecation that makes the largely forced writing bearable. Not forced, however, is Davidson’s acting — a pleasant surprise considering the number of comedians-turned-actors who have delivered lackluster performances over the years. Scott’s awkwardly dark humor and goofy facial expressions are so reminiscent of Davidson’s real-life persona that it is easy to forget that a camera is not just following him around as he meanders through Staten Island. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the storyline is simply not gripping enough to justify its lengthy runtime, the film genuinely translates as an inside look into Scott’s muddled, THC-infused mind, as well as into the forgotten borough which shaped Davidson/Scott into the man he is today. The casting seems a little uninspired — Marisa Tomei in yet another mom role and Steve Buscemi makes a gratuitous appearance — but they serve their purpose as prop characters while Davidson takes center stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you stick it out to the end, you may be wondering why this film came to fruition at all, since there is nothing that Davidson hasn’t addressed in his stand-up a million times already. Apatow, who has struck comedic gold with films that our generation will talk about for years to come, undoubtedly fell flat with this one. Some may find Scott’s childlike temperament to be too much, in which case there is nothing here for them. If, however, you find Scott to be incomprehensibly endearing, like me, you just can’t help but root for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 6.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

From the start, the chat was going wild, first arguing about which of his two films is best and later arguing about whether submitted or live questions should be prioritized. Either way, Aster answered many compelling questions during the event. He is quirky, extremely intelligent and an obviously creative artist, though he looks like more of a Wes Anderson type of guy — not the type to create such personal, dark and twisted films. The enthusiastic hosts first began with some small talk about life in quarantine, and everyone was grateful to hear that Aster has spent it diligently working on new projects. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94755\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2039268341\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94754\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94755\" data-attachment-id=\"94755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-01/a-s-program-board-presents-ask-ari-aster/screen-shot-2020-05-27-at-7-21-13-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=1440%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 7.21.13 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94755\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With introductions out of the way, hosts Esteban Alvarado and Kiyomi Morrison began to ask students’ pre-submitted questions. One of mine was asked in the first 10 minutes: “What inspired you to begin filmmaking in the first place?” to which Aster simply responded, “Movies.” He chuckled and then elaborated, “Loving movies … I’ve always been obsessed with movies and then at a certain point I just wanted to make them. I guess the urge on some level is to have a dialogue with your heroes. You grow up, you love so many films, you love so many filmmakers that you kinda want to engage as deep of a level as you can.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As expected, most of the audience members were film majors, so Aster was asked about his experience at film school. At the American Film Institute, he was able to make “all the mistakes you were eventually going to make anyway” and admitted that he “ripped off everybody … I mean, I’m still ripping off everybody.” The conversation then shifted to his breakout film “Hereditary” from 2018 and “Midsommar,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which was released only one year later in 2019. Aster is regarded as a horror director but instead calls himself a “genre filmmaker.” Although he sees “Hereditary” as a horror film, he doesn’t “even know what ‘Midsommar’ is” and claims that, as the films’ creator, “It’s not even my job to categorize them.” This is true because film genres are made to satisfy viewers, to help marketing teams and to be judged by critics. So even if Aster isn’t strictly a horror movie maker, fans agree that his first two films are creating an exciting and new category of horror, much better than other cheesy contemporary scary movies that Aster perceives as “archaic” and annoying. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to another question about using light instead of relying on darkness to scare viewers in “Midsommar,” Aster expressed that he had “a very specific aesthetic in mind,” and he was never concerned about the movie being scary. He knew the production company, A24, would promote it as a horror movie, which worried him because he anticipated that marketing would “create expectations that the film had no interest in meeting.” His thinking was to make it an “anthropological travelogue” in Sweden, and if anything, he would call it an “existential horror film.” It is a film that is about “codependency,” so when a student asked if the film had a happy ending for its main character Dani, Aster explained that although she escaped a toxic codependent relationship with her boyfriend Christian, she then “found herself in another codependent relationship with the village.” So although the Swedish group or cult was “racist, homicidal” and obsessed with “eugenics,” Dani’s new relationship was “very well functioning” as opposed to the one with Christian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the last half of the interview, the hosts moved on to Aster’s first full-length film “Hereditary,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which like its successor film is about trauma and grief. Many students, both through pre-submitted questions and live chat questions, wanted to dive into Aster’s mind and learn the inspiration behind his complicated family story in “Hereditary.” He explained that the film depicts the “corrosive effects that grief can have on a family dynamic,” and the end can be seen as a metaphor for “trauma completely changing somebody, utterly, and not necessarily for the better.” Toni Collette’s performance was undeniably stunning and chilling, and yet she wasn’t nominated for an Academy Award; one student wondered if Aster believed she was “robbed” of that nomination or if he even cares about the Oscars. After a bit of scoffing at the idea, Aster said he didn’t care; however, he immediately admitted that “when that time of year rolls around, you care, ya know,” especially since his team believed Collette had “a chance,” though he wasn’t expecting anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, both of his films were shut out of any Academy Awards nominations, but one can hope he receives the recognition he deserves for future projects. Aster revealed that he is working on a “nightmare comedy,” having just finished a new draft, and said, “ All I know is that it’s gonna be four hours long, over 17 [years of age].” His production company, Square Peg, is also working on a remake of “Save the Green Planet,” which Aster is excited about because he wanted to know what it means to be a producer, and as a fan of the original film, he knew he wanted to take on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This event was any movie lover’s dream as students were able to pick Aster’s brilliant mind and learn more about the film industry. In the last few minutes of the interview, Aster was asked another one of my questions and gave his advice to aspiring filmmakers: “It’s all very obvious but, I mean, if you want to write, write and finish something,” and if you want to direct, you have to find people and “film it with your phone if you have to.” As an end to the compelling event, Aster gave a shout out to the class of 2020, saying, “This is no way to graduate, but you did it … you don’t go to me for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspiration words, but this is going to be over.” And, since he assumed most attendees were film students, he highlighted the importance of filmmaking, saying, “I don’t know what I would do without movies and TV while I rot in this apartment.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

With the most legendary people to ever play the game, the cast was an obvious strength of the season.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pre-merge focused on old school versus new school, with many older players like Boatwright, Ethan Zohn, Parvati Shallow and Yul Kwon unfortunately being picked off. After the merge, everything centered on big threats versus little threats and lions versus hyenas, as said by Vlachos. In a season of winners, everyone was a threat to grab the crown, but some were such dominating winners that they knew they were threats. People like Vlachos, Ben Driebergen, Jeremy Collins and Tyson Apostol needed each other to protect themselves from hyenas and people like Clarke, Nick Wilson and Spradlin-Wolfe who were sneaky, strategic and under the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gameplay this season was intense and extremely fast paced. One fantastic move was Denise Stapley single-handedly voting out Diaz-Twine (thus dubbing her the “Queen slayer”) using a hidden immunity idol that Diaz-Twine had given to her. This took guts and moved Stapley up from the “lower-threat” position she was in before. At the merge feast, she described the move, maybe leaking too much information. Clarke picked up on this, saying that “it just made her look really good. But I have to imagine everybody at the table thought, ‘Hmm, like, one person has a resume out here, good to know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final nine, Vlachos brilliantly blindsided Clarke in a 4-3-2 vote, an extremely rare shake-up. Unsure if Collins had an idol to save himself, the majority alliance of Clarke, Sarah Lacina, Driebergen, Wilson and Vlachos decided to split the vote between Collins and Fitzgerald. Spradlin-Wolfe and Stapley saw this as a good opportunity to get rid of a threat and joined them. Spradlin-Wolfe, one of the most intuitive people to play the game, said, “I think Tony is trying to play double agent … I feel like Tony is my biggest enemy out here right now.” She was proven correct when Vlachos flipped, bringing Wilson, Fitzgerald and Collins together to vote for Clarke, who went home with an idol in her pocket. It was an unfortunate ending but a major win for Tony.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recency bias be damned, I like Wilson, even though he did the opposite of what I wanted many times, like voting out Clarke, Kwon and Spradlin-Wolfe. He also voted out Shallow, his high school crush (and my personal all-time favorite player), when he could’ve easily swung the vote to Wendell Holland and shaken things up. That takes a lot of nerve to do, and if I were on the island with Shallow, I don’t think I would ever write her name down, as it goes against my beliefs as a Shallow fan (the main one being that she should have won “Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains”). I wouldn’t win the game, but at least we’d be friends, and that’s what really matters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With good moves come bad moves, and Driebergen’s decision to allow himself to be voted out at the final five so Lacina (who ended up not even making it to the end) could pad her resume was probably the worst. I just know </span><a href=\"https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/survivor-35-finale-chrissy-hofbeck-ben-driebergen-twist-news/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrissy Hofbeck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was jumping out of her seat when Driebergen literally gave up his game to make a friend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After critics panned “Survivor: South Pacific” for having a below-average cast, I was glad that  Clarke returned to the game and proved she was a great winner. She played a smart under-the-radar game; “Survivor” host Jeff Probst said, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eeidwtQT_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“so many times you forget she’s there. She’s really good at that.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She was so invisible that Apostol forgot her name in one confessional when listing players: “People like Wendell, Nick, Yul, and … I don’t even know who the last one is. Sophie. So under the radar that I did not even know her name.” In the same episode, he was voted out. Sophie voodoo is real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season was a trial run for fire tokens, an in-game currency that allows people to buy advantages. As a whole, I didn’t think they served much purpose other than to give more screen time to the “Edge of Extinction,” but at least it was an interesting concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ill-fated and fan-hated “Edge of Extinction” returned, the theme from two seasons ago that allowed eliminated players to stay and starve in “Survivor” purgatory, with two chances to get back into the game. After being voted out first, Anderson returned to the game at the final six.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anderson </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the “Edge of Extinction.” She found advantages, disadvantages and completed all the required grueling tasks, like running around the island 20 times (on very little food, which was a theme of the Edge). She, along with Shallow as a buddy, ended up collecting so many fire tokens that she bought three advantages: a jar of peanut butter and an immunity idol. “I’ve been grinding slowly and quietly for so long, but all this hard work is worth it,” Anderson said, moments before winning her way back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She connected with Fitzgerald, who was at the bottom of the pack, and they picked off the rest of the contestants and made their way into the finals. It’s always good to watch an underdog story; every time I counted Fitzgerald out of the running, she proved me wrong. She’s now the only contestant to play multiple seasons of “Survivor” without ever being voted out (excluding leaving early). Fitzgerald played a scrappy game, winning two immunity challenges and finding advantages, and in any other season, she would’ve gotten some votes. However, this came down to a race between Vlachos and Anderson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final tribal council, Anderson pulled out her CVS receipt-length list of every advantage she had found and used in the game </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extorting Vlachos into giving her six tokens, sending a challenge advantage to Wilson, giving a tribal council advantage to Collins </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was commended on her dominant game in the Edge. However, she was criticized for not playing as hard once she got back into the game, unlike Chris Underwood, the winner of the first “Edge of Extinction” season. She ultimately played a good game, but it was no match against Vlachos’ dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting voted out second on “Survivor: Game Changers” three years ago, Vlachos had work to do. He edited his intense strategy of finding idols down to playing it safe in the beginning and letting people form a new impression of him. “I want everyone to get nice and comfortable with me; their guards are here right now [putting their arms up], and they’re slowly coming down … When it gets down to here, BANG! [punches] That’s when the sucker punch comes in,” he said in the very first episode. He held true to his words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, he was quiet and unassuming and then later got to work. Along with finding idols and advantages, he proved his social game when he convinced Collins, Wilson and Driebergen each to give him a fire token. He won four individual immunity challenges, something he had never accomplished in his original season, constantly worked with people on opposing alliances to get himself further and rekindled his and Lacina’s “Cops-R-Us” duo. It got him to the end, where his aggressive strategy deemed him worthy of getting the grand prize. The </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SandraDTwine/status/1260766588996902912\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queen stays queen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but “Survivor” crowned a new king.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season provided memorable moments, funny interactions and great gameplay to go with a fantastic cast. My favorite moments included Spradlin-Wolfe begging people to talk to her, Vlachos and Collins arguing over what a week was, Adam Klein trying desperately to play a decoration on the voting stand as an idol, the “Sandra Bench” and the all-inclusive family visit that ended with a giant thank-you hug to Probst. Shallow described the season as “a fan’s dream” in an interview, and I’m so glad I was not disappointed. Might this season be the best one ever? We’ll need some time away from it to decide, but I think it’s one of the best in some time.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-94415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the quarantine, you may think you’ve watched every show possible, but Netflix’s “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the best new series that you probably don’t even know exists. Due to its lack of advertisement, this revolutionary and unapologetically unique show remains relatively obscure, and even more than a month after its release it is still deprived of the popular buzz it deserves. “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is based on a 2012 memoir by Deborah Feldman, “Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.” It follows a 19-year-old girl named Esther Schapiro, otherwise known as Esty, played by star Shira Haas, a 24-year-old Israeli actress who is already famous in Israeli cinema and television but has found new international fame with this series. Esty, like Feldman, escapes her highly secluded and heavily regulated Hasidic Jewish community. More specifically, Esty belongs to the Satmar community in Brooklyn, New York, and she flees to Berlin, Germany to escape the strict and limited lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As revealed in the 21-minute documentary, “Making</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unorthodox,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also on Netflix</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Satmar community is originally from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Szatmárnémeti</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hungary, and was created by descendants of Holocaust survivors in New York post-WWII. Their native language is Yiddish, and because the creators wanted to get every detail right, some actors who didn’t speak Yiddish had to learn the language for the show. As all Hasidic Jewish sects, the Satmar community interprets the Torah literally and follows very traditional rules. Both men and women dress very modestly and marry young, but women are especially protected from the outside world. They do not have access to higher education, they are forbidden from showing their hair and their main purpose in life is to bear children. As Esty describes in the show, they must rebuild the six million Jewish lives lost in the Holocaust.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escaping the community is nearly impossible, and even after it’s accomplished, members hunt down the runaways and try to coerce them into returning. It is essential that no Jew loses their way, so after Esty flees Brooklyn, her husband Yakov Schapiro, otherwise known as Yanky, and his cousin Moishe Lefkovitch follow her. Her arrival in Germany marks the second half of her story, and the producers disclose that the first half of the limited series closely portrays Feldman’s life, but the second half is entirely made up. Esty arrives in Berlin and quickly finds a group of friends who are all students at a prestigious music conservatory, and she sets her heart on winning an almost-unobtainable scholarship to the school. Location in this series is very important because a young Jewish girl going to Germany seems nonsensical, but is it there that Esty can truly find herself, and it brings history into a full circle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Haas described in “Making Unorthodox,” I agree that the show isn’t “a story about the existence of God or something like that. It’s more about the right to have your own voice.” “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes us into a fascinating and widely unknown community, and though it is scripted, it gives viewers a raw, never-before-seen insight into the private lives of Hasidic Jews. Esty was always told and always knew that she was different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she even warned Yanky before their arranged marriage. I believe that she will always have a certain level of respect and love for her upbringing, but she knew she could not live like that forever. She knew that she had to shed her roots to gain freedom. The show is only four episodes long, and when I realized that I couldn’t press “next episode,” I threw a fit. It ends with Esty’s audition, and the outcome of her acceptance to the music school that is so crucial to her remaining in Germany is unknown. I wouldn’t say the final episode ends on a cliffhanger, but it did leave me yearning for more, and made me want to run away to Berlin for no reason at all. There is no confirmed season two yet, but Feldman does have a sequel to her book called “Exodus: A Memoir,” so we can only hope for more of Esty since this series’ length was greatly disappointing. As Feldman explained, the general public doesn’t know much about Hasidic Jews, but they do know “the essence of what’s happening, that’s what’s universally understood.” The essence is finding individual freedom, finding your own community and finding where you belong, even if it means sacrificing everything. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 4.5/5</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

id=\"caption-attachment-94383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of IMDb</p></div>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warning! Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be fooled by the title. While “Never Have I Ever” may sound like an otherwise banal and dry teen show from the name, the show presents so much more for the representation of women of color in television and a fresh realistic storyline for a culturally diverse audience. Each episode’s title is clever, as it starts with “Never Have I Ever” and ends in a hint as to what tumultuous conflict will come to fruition in the next episode. As a half-Indian viewer, I was intrigued to see how the show would represent Indian culture — particularly Indian stereotypes that have </span><a href=\"https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/198683\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pervaded media culture in the past</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Would this show extend beyond the nerd stereotypes that suffuse Indian culture? The answer is not simple, but one that is craftily developed by popular Indian-American creator Mindy Kaling, who based the show loosely on her own childhood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pilot season consists of 10 thirty-minute episodes, which turned out to be a good condition for a five-hour binge-fest on my sofa. The show is definitely geared toward younger audiences, as the characters are all in high school and the plot revolves largely around a teen romance between 15-year-old main character Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet). While this seems like an otherwise familiar coming-of-age storyline, the show challenges the topic of lust based purely on attraction, something refreshing to see in a young-adult comedy. The conversation about Devi’s impending loss of virginity is thrown into disarray between Devi’s own inner-reluctance and constant surveillance from Devi’s mom (Poorna Jagannathan). While this comedic element consumes the plot, other dilemmas in the show confront grief in the loss of Devi’s father, her sudden paralysis and the comeback into her sophomore year with her two best friends Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez). </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramakrishnan’s breakout performance as Devi brings a unique spark to the show, as her wit, intelligence and humor are coupled with her endless deflection of the loss of her father, until she reaches an emotional break. Her sought-after vision is to live a normal teenage life, which is disrupted by the harsh parenting of her mother, which allows Indian viewers to relate to the strict but loving parenting style of Indian parents. However, Devi’s mother proves to be a multi-dimensional character as well, whose choices are understandable from her own emotional trauma. Devi’s life events are humorously and uniquely narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe, which might seem odd at first, but is later justified in the show’s storyline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable characters include Devi’s goody-two-shoes cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), who is portrayed as the “beautiful” and “innocent” member of the family, a doctorate student at CalTech who is hesitantly preparing for an arranged marriage. While Devi is constantly sparring with her family, she soon realizes that her rejection of Indian cultural norms is something she shares with Kamala, more than she may initially realize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her wealthy academic competitor Ben (Jaren Lewison) is originally depicted as an antagonist who will do anything to one-up Devi, but a character who sweetly turns out to be one of Devi’s greatest allies and who faces adolescent battles of his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devi’s best friends Eleanor and Fabiola rightfully get their own minor storylines, weaved in seamlessly to the challenges high schoolers face in regards to family and sexuality. These plot points sometimes clash with Devi’s own self-absorbed attitude, which contributes to major highs and lows in their collective friendship. In a way, the show serves as an enlightening awakening in each of the three friend’s lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Indian culture, “Never Have I Ever” may have some eye-roll moments for Indian audiences, especially in the reference of Priyanka Chopra as the epitome of “Indian beauty” multiple times in the series. Similarly, the characterization of Devi as the stereotypical sexually undesirable geek is a bit tiresome to see in such a diverse show. However, the charming moments present in the series definitely outweigh the Indian-American references crafted to appeal to the Americanized gaze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Never Have I Ever” may westernize some elements of Indian culture but stands out in its portrayal of its main character: Devi adapts from an insecure high school teenager to a bold and risk-taking young adult. Devi’s ethnic background is an essential part of the show in how it shapes Devi’s shifting attitudes and uprise against omnipresent tradition. The show applies truthful elements of malicious behavior that stem from growing up and confronting our own inner demons, whether it’s an absent family in Ben’s case or the acceptance of loss in Devi’s. The series ends on an enlivening note in the neglect of fulfilling a perfect teenage fantasy in favor of growing to accept the reality of what makes us happy in our individual lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

The show changed drastically in 2019, when Klum and Gunn left the show to work on </span><a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a31954897/making-the-cut-heidi-klum-tim-gunn-leave-project-runway/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Making the Cut,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an Amazon original that premiered in March 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the subsequent seasons with replacements Karlie Kloss and former “Project Runway” winner Christian Siriano weren’t enough to satisfy a craving for Klum and Gunn, then look no further than “Making the Cut.” Twelve designers partake in the same exact competition as before — but on the inside, the show has many noticeable changes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is just how blatantly expensive the whole show is. The prize was upped to $1 million dollars — the same amount offered to people starving on an island for 39 days (“Survivor”) and double that of being locked in a house for three months (“Big Brother”). Even half a million would be generous as a prize, but the whopping sum of cash is chalked up to the show’s obsession with finding “the next big global brand” and the prize that would jump-start their career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the prize wasn’t enough to prove Amazon is investing a lot of money into the show, the workrooms and locations for filming are insane. In the show’s premiere, we meet the designers as they gawk at the New York City skyline and settle in — just kidding! Time to fly to Paris, and then, halfway through the season, get bored of all the luxury and switch again to Tokyo. The designers’ first runway show takes place at night in front of the glowing Eiffel Tower. Other runway shows in the season are at the Musée Des Arts Décoratifs, on the banks of the River Seine, at an outdoor museum in Tokyo and at Amazon Fashion’s digital immersion experience, where looks are displayed with backgrounds projected behind them in an amazing display of futuristic technology.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1977838143\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94294\"><img data-attachment-id=\"94298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/heidi-klum-and-tim-gunns-making-the-cut-barely-makes-it-work/variety-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"681,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Variety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94298\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?resize=681%2C383\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?w=681&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a joy to watch some of these fantastic runway presentations, and it certainly makes for great TV when the designers get choked up while premiering their work in front of the Eiffel Tower. It was so cool that I wanted to get into fashion design just to make it onto Season 2! However, all dramatic tension is lost when the contestants are corralled back into the workroom to hear the results of the episode. It’s a nice space, but why the contestants can’t have the excitement of a win on the actual runway, at these incredible locations, is still unknown to me. Can you imagine being eliminated, and then crying to inspirational music as you walk out of one of the coolest museums in France? That would be great to watch, even if your dreams </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crushed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of having six designers on stage at once for critiques, Klum and the judges (including blunt superstar Naomi Campbell, whose appearance probably triples the entirety of the show’s cost) talk to about four contestants individually, then make a decision about them. Citing that “a conversation can change everything,” Klum asks the judges the not-so-slogan-ready “Have any of you judges changed your mind?” which we hear every episode and is put to good use twice. The clunky phrase “Congratulations, you’re making the cut,” said to safe contestants, is nowhere near as cold and dramatic as “You’re in,” heard on “Project Runway.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fashion, one day you’re in, and the next day you are out,” Klum cautioned previously, but here, states, “In fashion, sometimes you’re making the cut, and other times you are not making the cut, unless some of the judges have changed their mind.” It’s a bit too awkward to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a good note, the contestants are an obvious plus in the show. Unlike “Runway,” these are skilled designers that have already established a brand for themselves, so their talents are unmatched. It’s an incredibly diverse cast as well, with contestants from Malaysia, Israel, Belgium and Italy, alongside the seven from the United States. In particular, Sander Bos’ insane creativity, Esther Perbandt’s stubbornness to deviate from her all-black wardrobe, and Martha Gottwald’s JoJo Siwa-inspired colorful clothing all caught my eye.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest changes the show sees is the introduction of invisible seamstresses that do most of the tedious work for the designers, who leave instructions on what to do. This is implemented due to the insistence that this is a design, not sewing, competition but the language barrier sometimes leaves the stressed contestants with unfinished garments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another noticeable change is the new segments of Klum and Gunn hanging around in whichever city they’re currently in, doing activities like virtual fighting, getting caricatures painted, shopping, learning words like “titillating” and trying to prove to the audience that they’re totally friends. “Look, everyone, we do get together outside of filming! We totally aren’t playing into the admiration fans have for this duo and using it to our advantage! We shop just like you!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you desperately miss Klum and Gunn and miss watching innovative fashions walk down the runway, this show does the job. Some of the challenges, particularly the ones in the “Opposing Forces” and “Pop Up Shop” episodes bring out the best in the designers — it’s always a pleasure to watch talented people do what they’re best at. For now, it’s “making the cut.” Fine, Heidi Klum, it sticks around after a while.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

400;\">Warning! Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first heard about Netflix’s upcoming new release, “Outer Banks,” I was drawn in from just the title. The story is, you guessed it, set in the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Banks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Banks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a chain of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina known for their small-town vibe and picturesque beaches. As someone who has grown up in South Carolina, I often took spontaneous trips to the infamous “Outer Banks.” It’s the kind of place where people “either have two jobs or two houses,” according to the show’s main character John B. Ironically, the series “Outer Banks” </span><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/article242210291.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was not filmed in the Outer Banks at all</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in Charleston, South Carolina, a similar setting to the Outer Banks in landscape and culture. From just the title alone, the series had potential for me, which I soon discovered measured up to a blend of dramas like “Gossip Girl,” “The O.C.” and other fan favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series revolves around a 17-year-old teen named John B. Rutledge (Chase Stokes), who recruits his three best friends to search for a legendary gold treasure that is associated with the mystery of his father’s disappearance at sea. John B. and his insanely attractive best friends, JJ (Rudy Pankow), Kiara (Madison Bailey) and Pope (Jonathan Daviss), make up the “Pogues,” aka the poor outsiders of the island. The other half of the island consists of the “Kooks,” the wealthy elite that includes John B’s love interest, Sarah Cameron (Madelyn Cline). Sarah’s father, Ward Cameron (Charles Esten), is a seemingly innocent character also interested in finding the treasure. The other Kooks on the island, including Sarah’s initial boyfriend Topper (Austin North) and his friends, will do anything to disrupt the Pogues’ day-to-day activities.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The first two episodes are lackluster at best, but the series quickly picks up and is hard to turn away from. While the episodes revolve largely around the central storyline of the treasure hunt, the loyal crew encounters many other setbacks, which include (but are not limited to) drug dealers, a blind woman with a shotgun, being pushed off of a 20-foot balcony and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these may appear like seemingly ridiculous adventures, watching them makes viewers feel like they are a part of the outlandish ride. The story could easily hit a lot of dead ends, but the sequential clues John B. and his friends discover in relation to his father’s vanishing allow us to think that the squad is merely one step away from finding the life-changing pot of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of the Pogue characters is cleverly captivating, as they all have dynamic personalities that could reflect a real-life group of teenage friends. This includes John B. having no real guardian while being the leader of the group and his best friend JJ who faces recurring monetary and familial issues. Contrastingly, Kiara is the rich girl trying to justify her position within the Pogue group, and Pope is the whip-smart, morally righteous character who wants to stay out of trouble to protect his potential for a college scholarship.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94215\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1943847636\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94212\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94215\" data-attachment-id=\"94215\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/outer-banks-does-netflixs-new-east-coast-teen-drama-live-up-to-the-hype/netflix1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Netflix1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94215\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=800%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last three episodes could easily blend together, as they all follow the police chase of John B., who is mistaken as a fugitive at the peril of Ward’s malicious intentions. I almost threw something at my screen because I was hoping again and again that the villains would finally lose. This plea is due largely to the stark contrast between the morals and actions of the Pogues and Kooks that makes viewers deeply loathe the rich elites of the island. The ironic aspect of this cultural divide is that the struggle between the rich and the poor could easily morph into the reality of social class disunity in Charleston or the Outer Banks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this heavy conflict, the season wraps up nicely, but in a manner that draws some uncertainty in the future state of the Pogue crew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While “Outer Banks” doesn’t present a plot that is holistically original, the nonstop adventure and suspenseful plot twists are enough to keep your eyes peeled. The young adult series gives viewers (especially UC Santa Barbara students) the comforting illusion that we are there alongside the characters, spending our days in the golden sunshine and ocean mist without a care in the world.

The show — which by appearance alone is already a bastion of Midwestern redneck culture (think lots of camo, guns and missing teeth) — is jam-packed with moments that leave viewers completely gobsmacked. Highlights include: the producers finding out Carole’s second husband Don Lewis was missing and believed dead, a tiger tearing off a GW Zoo employee’s arm (and Joe immediately reappearing in an EMS jacket), Travis’s tragic death, Joe’s jaw-dropping eulogy for his late husband, an arson attack, Joe’s shocking 19% of the vote in the Libertarian party primary for the governorship of Oklahoma and — of course — the entirety of the murder-for-hire plotline that resulted in Joe’s current 22-year prison sentence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chaotic series would likely have done well regardless of when it was released, but its drop during a pandemic no doubt improved its viewership. The show is a perfect distraction from the stresses of daily life during a global crisis because it is somehow more bizarre than the world we are currently living in. “Tiger King” purposefully caters to an audience that looks down upon those on the show and was undoubtedly produced and edited with that factor in mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Joe is charismatic and elicits some sympathy, he is also incredibly unlikable. Most of the other main players are villainous as well. Carole and Howard are incredibly vindictive, Jeff Lowe is maddeningly misogynistic, Doc Antle is a manipulative abuser. Those who feel the brunt of these actions are the people (and animals) in Joe’s close orbit — not his many adversaries. Multiple employees of the zoo lost limbs under Joe’s watch. It was an open secret that Joe plied his young, heterosexual husbands with meth and other drugs to ensure their dependence on him. Joe sucked his parents’ savings dry and let them become embroiled in his ongoing lawsuit with the Baskins. And though the show was centered on the obsession with an illicit market for big cats in America, the show did very little to highlight the cruelty that they face in captivity, rather letting the interviewees point blame at the “real” abusers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These conclusions are not hard to reach but are certainly easy to overlook due to the high entertainment value that the show provides. The ethical implications probably won’t impact the viewership of “Tiger King,” but it is certainly heartbreaking to walk away from the show with the realization that nobody is better off than when the show began (except for John Finlay, who married a woman, covered his “Property of Joe Exotic” pubic tattoo and got a new set of teeth). The roughly seven-hour span of “Tiger King” was not nearly enough time to scratch the surface of all of the bonkers twists and turns the show threw at viewers and leaves us with far more questions than answers. Though, one thing is certain: Joe Exotic finally accomplished his dream to be famous.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Like many of director and screenwriter John Hughes’s projects, “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” is the definition of a feel-good movie without feeling cheesy or inauthentic. While Ferris is the carefree guy we all sometimes wish to be, Cameron stands as the polar opposite, reminding us it’s possible to still have fun even if you’re a less-than-optimistic person.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6gABQFR94U\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 3:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Hereditary”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prime Video</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hereditary” is almost too difficult to describe in a sentence or two, so I’d recommend just checking it out for yourself.

Interested in the aesthetic of ‘70s and ‘80s skateboarding? Well, regardless of your answers to those questions, skater and director Stacy Peralta has crafted together a masterpiece of footage detailing the rise to fame as well as the struggles many skateboarding athletes had faced during the initial creation of the Bones Brigade skating group, comprised of members Tony Hawk, Lance Mountain, Rodney Mullen, Steve Caballero and many more. </span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCUstFvjIrM\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 6:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Pretty in Pink”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prime Video</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring the queen of the ‘80s, Molly Ringwald, “Pretty in Pink” is the story of a shy high school girl falling in love with a preppy rich boy who, of course, has extremely mean and shallow friends who disapprove of their relationship. Filled with an amazing soundtrack, outrageous fashion choices and ‘80s aesthetic, “Pretty in Pink” is a perfect movie choice for almost anybody.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rAFVlr65k\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 7:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “The Disaster Artist”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prime Video </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Disaster Artist” is based on the making of real-life cult film “The Room” and stars several beloved actors: James Franco, Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Alison Brie, Dave Franco and even Josh Hutcherson, who recently visited the UC Santa Barbara campus in support of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMKX2tE5Luk\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 8:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Her”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the most visually pleasing films I’ve ever seen, “Her” shows the strained relationship between a man (Joaquin Phoenix) and the artificial intelligence software on his phone called Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), similar to that of iPhone’s “Siri.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QRvTv_tpw0\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 9:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I, Tonya”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hulu</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the true events of Tonya Harding’s life as a professional figure skater, Margot Robbie delivers an excellent performance (my favorite performance of hers to date) and shows viewers the inside life of one of the sport’s most infamous athletes.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXZQ5DfSAAc\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 10:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Kill Bill Vol. 1”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hulu</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kill Bill Vol. 1” (and “Kill Bill Vol. 2”) has been regarded as one of Quentin Tarantino’s best works, and for good reason. Although the film is a blend of several overused film tropes, Tarantino manages to compile them in such a unique, intense and violent way that it almost feels like he created his own genre altogether with this film.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kSuas6mRpk\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 11:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “The Dark Knight”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Dark Knight” has recently been removed from Netflix catalog since the initial time of this article being written. Apologies for any inconvenience.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all this talk of director Todd Phillips’ portrayal of “Joker,” let’s take a trip down memory lane and remember the talent of Heath Ledger in one of his most iconic roles that’s still fun to marvel at today: “The Dark Knight.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 12:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Ingrid Goes West”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hulu</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring Aubrey Plaza as Ingrid, “Ingrid Goes West” is a comedic comment on our usage of social media apps like Instagram. As Ingrid becomes obsessed with one particular Instagram influencer, she becomes a full-on stalker and eventually finds herself in this influencer’s close circle … but of course, nothing gold can stay.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP4vD1tWbPU\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 13:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Final Destination”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is “Final Destination” or any other films of this franchise a life-changing piece of cinema? Well, no, but it is fun to watch all the creative ways in which people can die. While that sounds quite dark, “Final Destination” seems to kill its characters in more comical ways as the franchise grows, lending its viewers to a movie-watching experience that is more of an activity than a learning moment or a source of cinematic inspiration.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4Psj7d1ZI\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 14:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “The Witch”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My only recommendation: Watch this movie with subtitles and don’t give up on it. “The Witch” has somewhat of a slow burn and a cold, gray aesthetic.

Personally, I was a little afraid to rewatch these movies at my age, given how much I adored them as a kid, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that “Scary Movie” is still a delightful comedy to watch with friends.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLPULt0eJ4\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 18:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Inglourious Basterds”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another classic Tarantino film, “Inglourious Basterds” stands apart from other films about World War II, as it effectively rewrites history in a brutal yet glorious (pun intended) ending.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrRy6kSFF0\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 19:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Honey Boy”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prime Video</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring and based on the real-life events of Shia LaBeouf’s childhood, “Honey Boy” delivers a heartbreaking tale in which a young boy must navigate his abusive relationship with his father.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RR8WTQzwSk\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 20:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery” has been out for quite some time and isn’t weed-themed to go along with this specific date, it’s a piece of comedy gold that is particularly effective if watched during whichever “activities” you do to celebrate 4/20. Mike Myers’s performance of Austin Powers as a parody of classic characters in spy films, like in the “James Bond” franchise, stands the test of time, still bringing laughs despite its initial release in 1997.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vsANcS4Ml8\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 21:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Ex Machina”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Ex Machina” is a beautiful film to watch, with vibrant scenery, modern architecture and the blend of the robot and human aesthetic in the creation of Ava. “Ex Machina” tests the ethics of artificial intelligence and makes the viewer question their morals when it comes to technological advances such as the production of machines like Ava.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggUmgeMCdc\">here</a>. </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>April 22:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Purple Rain”</span></p>\n<p><b>Available on: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For any music-loving people out there, “Purple Rain” is an extremely fun way to get more engaged with the amazing career of Prince.

The show follows characters Monse (Sierra Capri), Ruby (Jason Genao), Jamal (Brett Gray) and Cesar (Diego Tinoco), who confront very serious coming-of-age challenges, often addressing them in comedic ways. The show provides a refreshing story with a diverse cast and realistic plot but still provides constant drama, incorporates themes of love and tests the boundaries of friendships.

Along the way, Syd faces issues like a fragmented relationship with her mother, a feeling of alienation from her peers and a journey to understand what her sexuality truly is. Beware, though: This show has just put out its first season comprised of seven episodes, which I binged in one sitting, and the ending is bound to leave you not only with an agape mouth but also with a hunger for more episodes.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93651\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"732412671\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93651\" data-attachment-id=\"93651\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/nyt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=2048%2C1105&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1105\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NYT\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=888%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93651\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=888%2C479\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=1024%2C553&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=1536%2C829&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The New York Times</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Spinning Out </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Spinning Out” is a show I was skeptical of at first because it follows a very familiar and banal storyline — the high-strung athlete struggling to keep their life together in an effort to have a balanced life. However, “Spinning Out” has quickly become a fan favorite, following a figure skating Olympic hopeful who navigates family, love and, more importantly, her mental health, as her competitive drive almost breaks her. I recommend this show because it develops an interesting backstory of figure skater Kat Baker (Kaya Scodelario) while addressing the importance of athletes’ struggles with mental health. While the story begins similarly to many other storylines, with Kat’s injury sparking a break that later introduces her to a new opportunity in figure skating, it raises many real-world issues that not only athletes face but young adults in general. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93652\" style=\"width: 938px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1313215425\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93652\" data-attachment-id=\"93652\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/hollywood-reporter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=928%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"928,523\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hollywood reporter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93652\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Hollywood Reporter</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Soundtrack</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Soundtrack” is not only a show for every music and dance-loving person out there but is also for those looking for a drama similar to “This Is Us” that seamlessly connects love stories between a group of people living in Los Angeles. While the song choices are questionable at times, the connection of the music to the emotional scenes and accompanying choreography enhance the show. It allows viewers to relate to personal “soundtracks” that help us get through various moments in our lives. The story primarily follows Nellie (Callie Hernandez) and Sam’s (Paul James) enticing love story, with other notable performances from Jenna Dewan and Christina Milian. The primary aspects that kept me watching were the thorough arc development of all the characters and my investment in the highs and lows of their shaky relationships. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93654\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"286983538\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93654\" data-attachment-id=\"93654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/tvline/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=620%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TVLine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=620%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93654\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?resize=620%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of TVLine</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Love Is Blind</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your guilty pleasure is any kind of reality TV dating show (like me), “Love Is Blind” is the show for you. The show ironically presents the term “blind dating” in a whole new realistic light, as 30 single people try to fall in love with one another without ever meeting face-to-face (perfect for quarantining!). In this way, the show freshly tries to allow relationships to be based purely on emotional connection instead of physical attraction. The show follows a speed-date format, where men can propose at any point they decide to and thereafter meet their partner in person. While I personally think it’s outrageous to be engaged to someone you’ve never met face-to-face, the show presents an entertaining twist and answers the question on all of our minds: “Is love really blind?” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93655\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2031443219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93655\" data-attachment-id=\"93655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/esquire/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Esquire\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93655\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Esquire</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, if you’re a fan of “Riverdale,” or dark dramas and horror in general, “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” is an adaptation worth watching. The dark coming-of-age show is a restructured story based on “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” that follows Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) in her duality as a half-witch, half-mortal standing against various supernatural forces. The rampant inclusion of dark humor, along with Shipka’s charming portrayal of Sabrina, are co-dependently what make the show intoxicating. The dynamic love triangle between Sabrina, Harvey (Ross Lynch) and Nick (Gavin Leatherwood) also helps to strengthen the series. Personally, I fervently enjoy the plotlines and pace of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” more than those of “Riverdale.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93656\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1141863280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93656\" data-attachment-id=\"93656\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/medium/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=1200%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Medium\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93656\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Medium</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>You</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although only two seasons in, “You” has quickly become a fan favorite. While I’m sure everyone and their mother have seen “You” by now, here is a final nudge to any of those who have not yet experienced the allure and adventure of Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgely). This show is a first-person account of Joe as he falls in love with beautiful women, places himself as a “savior” figure and quickly finds himself committing a plethora of crimes, all in the name of “love.” While the first season stands as more of a twisted and dark love story, the second season quickly transitions into more of a thriller, making it difficult not to binge the series in a couple of sittings. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93653\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251532680\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93653\" data-attachment-id=\"93653\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/new-york-post/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Post\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93653\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The New York Post</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Kristina Valencia contributed to the “I Am Not Okay With This” and “You” sections of this article.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

id=\"caption-attachment-93527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of New on Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his new Netflix comedy special  “Alive From New York,” Pete Davidson is, in a couple of words, over it. In a roller coaster ride of show, he takes (retaliatory) shots at ex-girlfriend, pop star Ariana Grande, shares an eyebrow-raising encounter with Louis C.K. and provides a more blunt response to the infamous Dan Crenshaw debacle that went down at “Saturday Night Live” last year. He’s brash, irreverent and pretty damn funny; it’s obvious that he has major issues, but you also know he’s willing to take jokes pretty far to make you laugh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you’ve ever laughed really hard at someone else’s joke and immediately looked up in concern for their mental health, you have a good idea of what it’s like to watch Davidson in action. It’s an experience all on its own watching Davidson struggle not to burst out into giddy, psychotic laughter between jokes (usually just barely catching himself). You feel like reaching through the screen to give him a hug and make sure he doesn’t hurt himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson isn’t quite as hilarious as I expected him to be, but he is pretty funny, and also happens to be very likable. Even after years of working at “SNL” and doing stand-up, he comes on stage with the giddiness of a new comic as his eyes dart around the room and his giggles roar into the mic at his own jokes. It can be off-putting to some, but it makes him come across as at least more authentic. If a joke doesn’t land, he just shrugs his shoulder and moves on, delivering the next punchline. His upfrontness, alongside his gruff New Yorker “I don’t know what’s going on” voice, happens to be pretty disarming and enjoyable to watch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson is also very open about his struggles with mental health. His father was a firefighter who died during the 9/11 terrorist attacks at Ground Zero, a loss that profoundly affected him as a kid. In a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJbqiHbusKY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Charlamagne tha God, Davidson talked about how important it is for him to be upfront about his darker periods, where he’s known to hurt himself and go on depressive episodes. His bluntness is a trait he carries on stage, making no effort to hide the fact he lives a life wracked by anxiety. Watching him be this real with his audience is impressive, and maybe even a little scary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To a generation that greatly values authenticity, Davidson’s voice may very well be one of the more sane ones to rise up. The smirk with which he dishes out petty stories and his constant giggling makes it clear that he’s having fun with this whole thing and proves that he does have a voice to contribute to the national conversation around him. This stand-up special is a chance for Davidson to respond and to take shots at people who have annoyed him in the past. It can come off as sloppy at times, but it’s got some really funny moments, and if you’re at all curious about the guy, this comedy special will probably give you some answers.</span></p>\n<p><span

id=\"caption-attachment-93475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of New On Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 13 years old when I first read Jennifer Niven’s depressing book “All the Bright Places</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” Like any other young teenager, I was going through a tumultuous and emotionally exhausting phase, yet my middle school years were also graciously filled with many young adult fiction books including “The Fault in Our Stars</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” “Divergent” and “The Hunger Games.” Luckily all of these books became movies right when I needed them to, but it’s better late than never for Netflix to finally release an “All the Bright Places”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">screen adaptation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story focuses on Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) and Theodore Finch (Justice Smith, who recently starred in “Pokemon: Detective Pikachu”), who slowly become friends through Finch’s avid push for a connection, and ultimately develop a romantic relationship. The film shows a typical high school setting, with teenage tropes like cliques and bullying, mostly aimed at Finch who’s labeled as a “freak.” Yet still, the movie pushes the limits of audience expectations as it shows high schoolers dealing with mental illness and mourning — topics that have become more mainstream in the past few years but are still taboo in many respects. At the start of the film, Finch plausibly saves Violet from jumping off a bridge, which she initially doesn’t appreciate. Violet later reveals her suicidal thoughts were due to the 19th birthday of her sister Eleanor, who died in a car crash at the bridge while Violet survived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this almost deadly encounter, Finch pursues Violet, but she denies his constant pleas to be partners for a school project and ignores his questions and greetings. Eventually, Finch is able to convince Violet to be his partner for the assignment to visit two wonders of their great state of Indiana. His upbeat and bold personality melts her cold facade, and Violet begins to open up to Finch because she realizes that she still has her life to live. Previously, she had stopped interacting with friends, refused to get into cars and overall halted her life because she couldn’t move on from her sister’s death – but Finch changes all that. While the beginning of the film presents Violet as the one who needs help, Finch’s own depression begins to unfold after the two begin to date. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I find that watching sad films forces you to put yourself in the character’s shoes because you have grown attached to them in the 90-120 minutes you’ve spent with them, and so I felt terribly for Violet. Other shows and films today touch on mental illness but fail to accurately display its effects or they misguidedly romanticize it. “All the Bright Places”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could’ve dived deeper into Finch’s depression, but it also demonstrated how sometimes people think they’re doing better than they are, and while their family and friends should help fix them, sometimes they can’t. Finch fell through the cracks — and perhaps Violet should’ve been paying more attention, but it is important to realize that his death was in no way her fault. He needed more help, he couldn’t control his mental illness by himself and in the end, he stopped trying. Violet closes the film with Finch’s wise teaching: “There can be bright places even in dark times. And if there isn’t… you can be that bright place with infinite capacities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the film was a bit slow, especially at the beginning, and it missed so many great points from the novel. Perhaps I am biased because I think books are always better than their on-screen adaptations, but there is so much more room for detail in a book than there is time in a film. The acting was adequate, and even though Fanning has held superb roles, I was disappointed with her presentation of Violet. The screenplay was well written, and it did include some of the more iconic quotes from the novel — or at least enough for any fan of the book to be satisfied. No one will miss out on much if they never watch it, but some weekends just call for movie marathons with your friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall rating: ★★★☆☆</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

Language differences aside, it’s also just one of the best romances in years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A French drama set in the 18th century, Céline Sciamma’s “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” richly tells the story of a relationship between two women. Marianne (a breakout Noémie Merlant) is an artist commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of an aristocratic woman, Héloïse (a terrific Adèle Haenel). However, because Héloïse is unwilling to marry a man she has never met, she has refused to pose for her portrait, running out another painter prior to Marianne. Héloïse’s mother instructs Marianne to spend time with her willful daughter under the guise of being her walking companion during the day so that she can paint her portrait in secret at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, nothing is as straightforward as it seems. As the two women spend more time together and get to know each other, feelings ignite and the tension between them thickens. Marianne’s initial stealing of glances at Héloïse to memorize her features for painting morphs into gazes of desire and attraction that are increasingly reciprocated. Marianne is no longer merely looking at Héloïse; she is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seeing </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her. She is no longer simply painting her subject, but her lover. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of their relationship shows that the journey, rather than the destination, is emphasized. Set at a gentle pace, the film enables the pair’s romantic connection to delicately kindle — when they finally consummate their love, it’s earned. Particularly noteworthy is that their relationship is depicted with a female gaze rather than being subjected to the more customary male gaze, allowing for the natural, comfortable progression of their intimacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One aspect I especially enjoyed about “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” was its ability to allow the viewer to see through the eyes of a painter. Having not one artistic bone in my body, I admired all the little details I wouldn’t have ordinarily noticed but realized are so crucial to a painter’s work: how someone is posed, how their hands rest in their lap, how the light illuminates their face and even the finer points of capturing an ear on canvas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film won “Best Screenplay” when it premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, and for good reason. Sciamma’s minimalistic approach to directing and writing her masterpiece leaves just the essence of her characters’ relationship for the audience to focus on. With simple, yet powerful lines such as, “Do all lovers feel they’re inventing something?” the viewer senses the depth of their intense bond.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music is seldom used in the film, but when it is, it’s used imperatively. There is no score, but one isn’t needed. Moreover, the luscious cinematography and exquisite acting of the two leads readily provide enough to engage the audience. Haenel and Merlant play off each other as equals in the narrative and relationship, enhancing each other’s performances while solidly holding their own; the palpable chemistry between them sells the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is a mesmerizing slow burn that spreads subtly and effortlessly. You hardly notice how everything has been building effectively to a devastating, yet masterfully controlled blaze until it crescendos, rendering you speechless with the haunting ending scene. The film offers much to unpack thematically, presenting a new take on what it means to love someone, on the philosophy of love and on how love and art intersect. Complex and multilayered, it will have you mulling over it for days to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is a poignant, brilliantly realized story about love. But more specifically, it is a beautiful meditation on the memory of love. The film reminds us to not regret past relationships that perhaps didn’t turn out the way we hoped, but to instead remember and appreciate what we gained from them.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is currently playing at the SBIFF Riviera Theatre. </span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jacky/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-4.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jacky/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jacqueline Wen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jacqueline serves as the Science and Tech Editor.
