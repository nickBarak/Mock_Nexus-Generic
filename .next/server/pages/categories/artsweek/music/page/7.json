Artists like Pharrell Williams, for example, who seem to have production credits and contributions all over in pop culture, are rarely cited for their actual solo work, becoming (unfairly) more of an image than a powerful solo musician. Toro Y Moi has often been placed into this strange and often inaccurate box of music culture; he’s been seemingly everywhere across genre and style and influence. Any music fan can recognize his face and fashion, yet strangely enough, he is not praised for his music to the same degree that he should be. Despite all of this, Chaz Bear, more frequently known as Toro Y Moi, proves through his live presence and energy that he is a great performer despite these constraints, standing alone as not only an iconic image but also a major influence and pioneer of 21st century indie music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi hit downtown Santa Barbara’s SOhO last Thursday for a stop on his tour following his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album release and after announcing a new album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Peace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is coming early 2019. With a long, successful career and a ton of commercial buzz, Chaz beautifully arrived on stage, maintaining a delicate balance of high energy and chill waves and prompting one of the danciest crowds I’ve ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaz began his set with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album opener “Mirage,” which was met with a strong response from the audience. The energy didn’t reach full potential, however, until he performed his new single, “Freelance,” soon after, which seemed to be the true start of the night. Toro himself was alternating between keys, a beat pad and solo vocals, meshing seamlessly with his incredibly rehearsed backing band. Sonically, things were just about perfect, with the vocal reverb balanced exactly as it is on record and instrumentation that was clean and vibrant.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

This moment in particular marked some of the highest audience involvement, with nearly everyone singing along to the catchy hook and dancing with the grooves. Despite the electronic-heavy landscape of “Boo Boo,” the live setting translated alarmingly well, with every 808 drum, groovy baseline and synth chord hitting hard and true. Much of the magic that Chaz Bear presents here lies in turning his recorded dreams into a live reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In person, Toro Y Moi was about as quaint and down-to-earth as I had imagined. He was a man of few words between songs and seemed to say more in performance than anything else. His movement and engagement were limited, yet effective, which made for a very intimate and immersive show. This mysterious and somewhat reclusive element of Toro is a bit of a staple of his image, and it proved extremely effective once paired with the strong backing band and lighting choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the more exciting moments mid-set came from Toro’s early classic album, 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of these deeper cuts worked as a nod to his more dedicated fans and provided a change of pace from the other tracks in the set. Moving emotional tracks like “Say That” and “So Many Details” were memorable moments at SOhO, and they personally took me back to my high school days when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was first released. Toro Y Moi wrapped up his set with classic hit “Rose Quartz,” a track that is lodged in the memory of any true fan of Chaz’s music and one that marked the start of a huge career. The performance was extremely powerful in its nostalgic nature and celebratory tone, ending the night where a lot of Toro’s fans began with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi is a total icon, not only in image and cultural positioning but also in diverse musicianship, intimate performative value and sheer, raw talent. If a look into his discography doesn’t prove this, surely some time in his live setting will. After an incredibly fun and ultimately moving night at SOhO, I can assure you that Toro Y Moi isn’t going anywhere but forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

A few couches accommodate hushed conversations amongst those already there, and any newcomer’s pre-existing social anxiety dissolves into the dim lights and welcoming energy. Some people have never been here before, but the Biko House has a way of making them feel right at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranging from experimental folk to gothic electronica, an array of local and touring talent showcased their music at the Biko House in an event organized by Funzone on Oct. 17. This recurring DIY event operates under the mission of providing an accessible, diverse and substance-free music community to the Santa Barbara area. Bands such as Deanne Bunn, Diatom Deli, Serpent Season and Roper Rider entertained an intimate crowd of less than 30 attendees on what could have been another boring Wednesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time most of the people who come to these shows don’t know the bands who are playing, so it’s always exciting to see what’ll happen,” Serpent Season’s Randall Leong, a UCSB alumnus, said. “It should get pretty weird, probably.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leong, once a Biko House resident, returned to play at this event for the same reason he became involved years ago: the ability to share his music in an environment where creativity is celebrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of festivity, Serpent Season wore Halloween masks as they strummed electric guitars to their self-described sound of “dreary, ambient folk.” With a single set of string lights illuminating behind them in the dark room, it felt like a live rendition of the scoring to a “Stranger Things” episode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the murals gracing the perimeter of the space introduced a newfound form of expression to the audience, especially as it mutated underneath a projector screening psychedelic images. Musicians rotated through the line up, moving into the space one after another — transforming it into one of their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For first-time attendee Gabby Mendez, a third-year English major, the combination of setting and sound is what made her experience memorable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was on an acid trip, but I’ve never done acid,” Mendez said. “I liked that it was different from what I normally listen to, and how the variety of sounds came together to deliver something really unique.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tennessee-based Diatom Deli gathered the largest crowd, filling the room with people both standing and sitting on the floor. Carrying her talent across the West Coast on tour, her multi-instrumental sound encouraged exploration of the unconscious mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is definitely one of my favorite venues I’ve played at so far on the tour,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deli Nebletts said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I loved most about Biko was that it felt like a safe space and everyone was really welcoming, which makes the world of a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Biko House is one of five student housing Co-ops in Isla Vista that stresses the importance of inclusion while supporting a community free of discrimination. The garage space in particular functions as an all-purpose space for the community, hosting events such as art exhibitions and small concerts. The environment not only attracts performers and attendees alike, but is highly valued by those who live there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the best thing I’ve ever been apart of at UCSB and I wish I had lived at Biko last year, too,” fourth-year philosophy major Isabella D’Alessandro said. “It’s cool because things like this are so accessible, they’ve definitely been a highlight of my time here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event wouldn’t have been possible, however, without the help of Funzone. Once a location in downtown Santa Barbara, Funzone now operates through Facebook as a key organizational element for booking shows in the area. Working with radio station KCSB to promote events such as these, they are able to foster a space of music for all ages and give underheard bands a platform for exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only for high school students, but even at UCSB there are a lot of kids that are under 21 that can’t go to half of what happens downtown,” Spencer Von Hershman, Santa Barbara resident and creator of Funzone, said. “It’s a nice other option for people who don’t want to party all the time, or simply aren’t interested in partying at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing an environment that unifies similar-minded people with something that they are passionate about is the ultimate goal of performances like Wednesday evening’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just a safe place to mess around, no one here is judgemental. People want to hang out with nice people who are here to enjoy themselves and be respectful,” Von Hershman said. “Santa Barbara is a really good community for that.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/","id":6608,"author":{"id":689,"name":"Nicole Szczepanek"},"related":[6607,6606,6605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Songs to Cry to During Midterms: An Artsweek Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=450%2C450&ssl=1","description":"In honor of midterms season, Artsweek has compiled a playlist of songs that are the perfect catalyst for emotional release. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We’re finally at the halfway mark of the quarter, which means you’re working hard and deserve a good cry between weeks five and six.

It was only 30 seconds into the song and we were both already blinking back tears. If this song can hit you with the feels when the sun is shining on your shoulders and there’s not a thing weighing on your mind, listening to this song as you’re huddled in the library at 3 a.m. contemplating every single life decision equals instant heartbreak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunhidi Sridhar</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Runaway” – Kanye West</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s something about Kanye being real and raw about his weaknesses that gets me on that crying-about-midterms wave. “Runaway” is the perfect song to plug in your headphones and take a respite from the world; it’s nine minutes of pure reflection. “Runaway” echoes regret (in my case, the regret of not starting to study for midterms earlier). The last three minutes of pure instrumental leaves space to to pick yourself up after shedding some tears. Even though I want to “runaway as fast as [I] can” from midterms, if Kanye can push through his struggle, so can I. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lizzy Mau</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Vienna” – Billy Joel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Slow down, you crazy child,” the Piano Man cautions us in these times of chaos. Beginning with a soft piano intro, Billy Joel mimics the feeling of drinking a glass of Chardonnay in the vineyards of Vienna, Austria. In an environment of complete confusion, where it seems like we are one midterm away from pursuing a career as a fitness model that advertises protein shakes on Instagram, the song reminds us to enjoy the here and now. Considering the fact that we are never guaranteed success, the only constant we can really rely on is that place, person or activity that inspires the energy we need to get through the many stressful days. So why not partake in a little bit of self-care and just enjoy life rather than speeding through its daily motions? “Vienna” waits for you. </span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 3662px;\" width=\"675\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medlyn Grasheyella</span></i>\n<p><strong>“Ex-Factor” – Lauryn Hill</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With breakup season on the way, this classic bop is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certified</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cry. There’s something especially poignant about Lauryn Hill’s voice that makes her words carry enormous weight. Her croonings of lost love on this track are just as powerful 20 years later as they were then, and the soulful backdrop remains a timeless classic. “Ex-Factor” expresses feelings that we have all felt to some degree, whether it’s minor rejection or a world-crushing heartbreak. It’s also a bit ironic that Drake sampled this song shortly before getting exposed for hiding his child and abandoning the mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Pasion-Gonzales</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Eleanor Rigby” – The Beatles</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” still haunts me and has ever since I was five, when my dad first played it for me. Even then, before I could understand the beautiful lyrics and the heartbreaking story they tell, I could feel the sorrow in this iconic Beatles song. After hours of self-imposed isolation, studying alone in the library for your first midterms of the year, you’ll be sobbing along when Paul McCartney asks where all the lonely people come from. A lament to the hardships of the elderly and dying alone, “Eleanor Rigby” will help you let out all those stress tears when you just need to simp during stressful midterm season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucy Holley</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars” – Mitski</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna see the whole world / I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent / I wanna to see the whole world.” Was wide-eyed mortal panic was ever felt, or said, so simply? In a panic bender of less than two minutes, Mitski pins everything from interview anxiety to ideal locations for death (Jerusalem, please). Her voice is frantic, carried by an instrumental that sounds less like guitar shredding and more like a guitar literally being shredded. It’s an experience accessible only after five shots of espresso.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if my body really is made of crushed little stars (which it is, according to popular consensus), remind me why I’m stuck memorizing solubility charts at 3 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Three Little Birds” – Bob Marley</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this song is filled with encouraging lyrics, it’s perfect for that moment during midterm studying when you’re about to tap out from exhaustion and frustration, but keep telling yourself to pull through because it’ll all be over soon. In that moment, you feel like every little thing is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gonna be alright, as Bob Marley says, since your test is tomorrow and you’re still up at 2 a.m. studying (and crying). However, once “Three Little Birds” engulfs your ears through the speakers in your headphones and Marley advises you to not worry about a thing, the tears once shed out of pure misery now emerge from a place of hope. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristina Valencia</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Doomed” – Moses Sumney</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somber and haunting, “Doomed” by Moses Sumney is the perfect track for your pre-midterm breakdown (or your post-midterm GPA funeral). Questioning the possibility of being doomed to live a life without love, Sumney’s existential crisis can easily translate to a college student’s eternal pondering of whether or not one can live without good grades, a degree or a job. Lean into Sumney’s mournful lyrics and breathtaking falsetto and supplement its lack of percussion with the steady sound of slamming your head into the library table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Needle In the Hay” – Elliott Smith</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you press play and the grim chords of “Needle In the Hay” lead into Elliott Smith’s somber tone of voice, you can predict where the song is about to transport you. The track is quick in being applicable to the plethora of feelings a college student will likely experience during midterm season, meaning that it’s perfect to sob into the night before your dreaded exam. As Smith sings, we experience feeling “strung out and thin” as we attempt to cram in material before exam day, somehow not remembering anything from the past few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Singh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Tears Dry On Their Own” (Original Version)  – Amy Winehouse</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winehouse sings of her despair and feelings of regret as she begins to walk away from a lover. The pain she feels from trying to move on is especially felt in her vocals in this original version. The songstress’s vivid lyrics bring listeners back to a time when they, too, had to close a sentimental affair. The backup vocalists singing “tears dry on their own” at the end of each chorus resemble a heartbreak song from the Motown era.This song is guaranteed to leave you crying as you cope with the end of your social life during midterms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Delamare</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Rock Bottom Riser” – Smog </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you get a lead feeling in your bones, or you feel empty after the stress of exams. As I inch toward my first college midterms, I am reminded, once again, of the feeling of home — the warmth of my mother, or even my cat — and I am whole again. This song encapsulates this as I realize that this isn’t the end, that midterms won’t be the death of me and that I, too, am a rock-bottom riser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sai Sondh </span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Come Back to Earth” – Mac Miller</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac Miller’s “Come Back to Earth” from his final album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great song to cry to when stressing out over midterms. “Come Back to Earth” has poignant lyrics that focus on mental health. Miller maintains, “My regrets look just like texts I shouldn’t send … I just need a way out of my head.” I think we can all relate to sending a risky text to a friend or significant other and overthinking it, or having an endless cycle of negative thoughts. UCSB students can also relate to the lyric, “And don’t you know that sunshine don’t feel right, when you inside all day.” Who wants to be inside studying all day at the library when you could be out soaking in the sunshine or surfing at the beach?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“SUMMER”- BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the heat of the summer I had no papers to write, midterms to take or TAs who won’t email me back. At this point in fall quarter, I know the one thing we all want more than a 4.0 GPA is to go back to irresponsibly basking in the Isla Vista summer sun with all of our friends on an oceanside deck. Go ahead and give “SUMMER” by BROCKHAMPTON a listen and let that summer nostalgia sink in to the sound of wistful piano chords and guitar runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin Fauni</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“The Middle” – Jimmy Eat World</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of the quarter again. Your brain feels like that microwaved mashed potato you forgot about after all your doze-offs snowballed into two-hour naps. But if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that the best remedy for midterm melancholia is some nice, wholesome 2001 pop-punk. Still don’t understand the confusing way your calculus professor teaches u-substitution? “Just do your best, try everything you can!” Hand cramping from all the bubbling and writing? “It just takes some time!” Feeling like this class is dragging on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> longer than you’d like? “You’re in the middle of the ride, everything will be just fine, everything will be alright!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Feliciano</span></i></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;\">“No Hard Feelings” – The Avett Brothers</span></strong><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s midterm season and you feel like you’re dying, so why not listen to a song that perfectly embodies that emotion? “No Hard Feelings” by the Avett Brothers is that song. Its calming melody paired with its depressing lyrics about death is the perfect combination to induce a stream of tears. The Avett Brothers have a profound way of making music that touches the innermost core of our emotions, and this is especially true of “No Hard Feelings.” So sit back, let your existential crisis consume you and cry it out to the Avett Brothers (and their ever-present banjo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elissa Padilla</span></i></p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/","id":6633,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6632,6631,6630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Young Thug Brings Energy to Hallo-weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A.S. Program Board pulled through and succeeded yet again in another year of bringing Gauchos together during the harsh times of our annual Halloween lockdown.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Saturday night, UCSB students came together dressed in Halloween costumes to enjoy the live performances of Young Thug and Social House. While the rest of Isla Vista was busy being policed for any pre-Halloween shenanigans, the Thunderdome offered a place of refuge for those who sought amusement as Young Thug headlined this year’s Delirium concert. Organized exclusively for UCSB by A.S. Program Board, the $5 concert was once again met with a successful turnout as the crowd and performers engaged together in this loud, drunken circus of a night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once inside the Thunderdome, the floor that is usually occupied by basketball players had been transformed into a general admission concert pit, filled with sweaty, shirtless frat boys, cat ears and devil horns galore. Dedicated fans could be seen enduring the heat and absence of personal space on the main floor while others lounged in the bleacher seats upstairs waiting for Young Thug. The crowd seemed to grow more excited as 9 p.m. rolled around, with unidentifiable puffs of smoke beginning to fill the air and costumed girls searching for strangers to take Instagram-worthy photos of themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening act was Social House, a rap duo from Pittsburgh, Pa., comprised of members </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles “Scootie” Anderson and Michael “Mikey” Foster. Although this pair is relatively new to the music scene, they have already worked with and produced songs for artists like Ariana Grande and Jennifer Lopez, recently pivoting to create music of their own.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Unlike some of their hip hop contemporaries, Social House has a rather mellow sound that was clearly reflected in the crowd’s demeanor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At previous shows I’ve seen at the Thunderdome, several audience members had already been plucked out of the pit by security guards early on in the night, so it was interesting to not see that occur so soon this time. Observing a lack of chaos, Social House was quick to change that and stir up excitement by asking each side of the audience to scream louder than the other and by playing brand-new songs they had never performed live before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, at 10:37 p.m., Young Thug made his way onto the stage and was greeted with an uproar of clapping, whistling and shouts of cheer. Despite the boiling temperature inside, Thug was draped in bold fashion choices from head to toe: purple beanie, green sweater, black T-shirt, leather pants and neon green and pink high-top sneakers.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84692\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1071783414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84692\" data-attachment-id=\"84692\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/delirium_marcos-reynoso_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1770&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Delirium_Marcos Reynoso_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C786&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84692\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1-1024x906.jpg?resize=888%2C786\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C906&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening with his song “On the Run,” Young Thug skipped on stage and began jumping in sync with the students in the crowd, fostering an atmosphere that invited everyone to let loose and dance. As the show progressed, the artist brought out a number of guests to the stage, including fellow rapper Duke, who is frequently featured in songs with Young Thug.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the middle of the show, Thug climbed off stage and ran straight to the front row, directly center of the ocean of swaying, drunk Gauchos hoping to get a decent selfie with him. Despite the buckets of sweat that had now drenched every student in sight, Thug remained close to these fans for a couple minutes while he continued to rap, eventually being joined down on the floor by Duke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to “With That,” Thug performed a myriad of hits like “pick up the phone,” “Pull Up On A Kid,” “About The Money” and “Icey.” In the end, Thug concluded his set with the once popular song “Lifestyle,” which famously launched the artist into the public eye with its interestingly unclear lyrics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately after “Lifestyle” ended, Young Thug and his entourage left the stage and the main lights came back on, signaling that it was time to depart. Though the overall performances provided by both Social House and Young Thug were enough to keep concertgoers active and interested for most of the night, many seemed to be disappointed when the show ended after only 50 minutes of Thug’s rapping. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite this somewhat quick ending, A.S. Program Board pulled through and succeeded yet again in another year of bringing Gauchos together during the harsh times of our annual Halloween lockdown.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/","id":6629,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6628,6627,6626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Young Thug To Headline Delirium 2018","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/young-thug-square.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/young-thug-square.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Superstar rapper and contemporary poet Young Thug has been announced as the headliner for Delirium, the annual Halloween show from A.S.

Program Board. Young Thug is set to showcase his freeform, hypnotic hooks to the Thunderdome on Oct. 27th. Thug is one of the founding architects who built the modern Atlanta rap scene, which emphasizes ad-libbing techniques and using one’s voice throughout the song as a versatile instrument.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I don’t care about people understanding me; I do it [music and fashion] for the weird ones,” Thug shared in a 2016 interview with <i>XXL</i>. Thug is an enigma. He rarely gives sit-down interviews with publications and only seems to showcase his personality via sporadic Instagram Live sessions. Even when Thug made a surprise appearance at Velvet Jones in late April to support fellow YSL-labelmate Gunna, he remained reserved and didn’t let his rockstar presence outshine his friend’s performance. But his unique music and eccentric fashion sense allude to the parts of his persona that are often kept hidden away.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Thug recently released the YSL-compilation <i>Slime Language</i> and the EP <i>On the Rvn</i>, both containing examples of Thug animatedly rapping over hints of pop embellishments. The track “High” from <i>On The Rvn </i>features Thug rapping, “All I got is a chicken for the thots” on a reworking of Elton John’s “Rocket Man.” Thug is at the apex of genre-defying music, as he often intermingles his creative sensibilities by rapping alongside the likes of pop princess Ariana Grande and indie producer Jamie XX.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">He has dabbled in the art of making a rap-country album with <i>Beautiful Thugger Girls</i>, which offers its fair share of love songs and anthems dealing with strife and drug dependency. <i>Barter 6 </i>is emblematic of Young Thug’s blond era, which brought the Birdman collab “Constantly Hating” and the romantic feature “Amazing” with R&amp;B crooner Jacquees. Thug’s cult-like following is undoubtedly due to his creativity as an artist. Even if you don’t think you would like attending a Thugger show, there’s at least one song in his discography that you can bop your head to.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For those who believe they are unfamiliar with Young Thug’s impressive catalog, you probably recall slight memories of hearing “Relationship” featuring Future in a backyard party on Trigo Road in Isla Vista, or an onslaught of Vines from 2014 featuring the rapper’s collab with Rich Homie Quan, “Lifestyle.” Travis Scott has also featured the rapper on “Pick Up the Phone,” “Mamacita” and “Maria, I’m Drunk.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">People often retreat to meme-ifying Thug’s presence and musicianship, yet Thug continues to punctuate his projects with inventiveness. He does not fit into the mold of what some people base their perceptions of rap on, but that is what makes him stellar.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Despite the news about Thug refraining from releasing music until 2019 in solidarity for his deaf brother, Thug has released a series of projects and features in 2018 and is hinting at the long-awaited release of<i> Barter 7</i>. Thug is at the helm of the new era of rappers turned rockstars, constantly reinventing himself while keeping the loyalty of hardcore fans. Thug will undoubtedly turn the Thunderdome into a frenzied playground of rap hits and booming basslines.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

SG Lewis, first debuted in Santa Barbara with a DJ set in The Hub. Last Wednesday night marked his return, although this time the 24-year-old <span class=\"s1\">performed </span>a brand new live show and brought an arsenal of new tunes with him, showcasing <span class=\"s1\">just</span> how far his music <span class=\"s1\">has progressed in a single year</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show was set against dark brick walls that define SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club’s industrial interior in downtown Santa Barbara. On stage was a basic five-piece band setup that sat atop a large, intricately designed carpet, dimly lit by a chilling mixture of blue and green lights. It was an effortless and simple design, but alluring <span class=\"s1\">nonetheless</span> <span class=\"s1\">—</span> one that sp<span class=\"s1\">oke</span> well to Lewis’<span class=\"s1\">s </span>style of electronic music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Walking inside the venue, I noticed that the initial energy and excitement for Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show seemed lacking. For <span class=\"s1\">nearly </span>an hour, people lingered between aRod’s opening set and the bar, although most hovered around the bar until <span class=\"s1\">right </span>before Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> performance. Perhaps the Wednesday night drink specials distracted from the usual pre-show excitement but, regardless, as soon as the lights shut off and the infectious build-up of “Coming Up” started playing, the energy flipped.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">“Coming Up” was one of two singles released from Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> <i>Dusk</i> EP, which came out earlier this year in April. The EP is the first component of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>much-anticipated debut album, <i>Dusk, Dark, Dawn</i>, a three-part, 18-track series with each part being <span class=\"s1\">set to release</span> separately.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Inspired by Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>history and fascination with U.K. club culture, each part of the album attempts to relay the distinctive moods, sounds and energies that make up different phases of a typical night out. First <span class=\"s1\">come </span>the feelings of anticipation and excitement for what’s to come<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">then</span> the sort of high-energy peak felt at the top of the night and<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">finally,</span> the downtempo comedown that follows that energy.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show last week served as an introductory experience to the musical expression of synerg<span class=\"s1\">y</span> between every different phase of a night out. Even on a Wednesday night, by curating a set that sonically builds, peaks and <span class=\"s1\">subsequently </span>comes back down<span class=\"s1\">, Lewisb guided </span>audience members through the exact journey of emotion and energy that inspired his upcoming album.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Transitioning from “Coming Up” into some of his upbeat tracks like “All Night” and “Better” (<span class=\"s1\">featuring</span> rising electropop star Clairo) solidified the vibe of the first phase. As more people crowded closer to the stage, it was evident that excitement was rising <span class=\"s1\">as </span>each song played. Needless to say, the previously off-putting <span class=\"s1\">atmosphere that filled the club </span>no longer existed in the presence of Lewis, who was accompanied by two other instrumentalists and a captivating duo of vocalists.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then, songs with heavier overtones like “Times We had” and “Smart Aleck Kill” <span class=\"s1\">furthered the crowd’s excitement and</span> <span class=\"s1\">brought </span>them closer to t<span class=\"s1\">he</span> peak energy level that Lewis likely wanted<span class=\"s1\">. In order to maintain that level of enthusiasm, he dropped</span> his most recent banger, “Hurting,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> with fellow Brit AlunaGeorge. <span class=\"s1\">A</span>t this point <span class=\"s1\">in</span> the night, the room was noticeably hotter, people were sweatier and the crowd was moving more groovily than ever.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But, a return to the slow magic of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>signature sound <span class=\"s1\">was </span>what truly <span class=\"s1\">tied</span> th<span class=\"s1\">is whole</span> sonic experience together. Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>sound is deeply mellow and introspective. It’s moody, minimal and full of synth — but also commanding<span class=\"s1\"> and</span> strong.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">His style<span class=\"s1\"> differentiates him from</span> the higher BPMs usually associated with EDM and, even more so, from the headbanging trap, bumpy house and tir<span class=\"s1\">i</span>ng future bass that currently dominates most electronic scenes. However, <span class=\"s1\">he has proved that </span>this does not make his music any less danceable or invigorating. In fact, it’s what landed him alongside U.K. powerhouse names like Disclosure and Jessie Ware at PMR Records in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What is so interesting about<span class=\"s1\"> Lewis’s show and his </span>latest project is how definitive it is of his multifaceted musicality. His ability to pull from a multitude of influences — whether <span class=\"s1\">it be </span>disco, East Coast hip-hop, R&amp;B or indie — and still maintain the cool and calm composure <span class=\"s1\">which </span>characterizes his niche in electronic music is fascinating.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Ending with “Warm,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> a slow-burning tune he impressively sang himself, and an encore comprised of both an unreleased track <span class=\"s1\">and </span>“Yours,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> Lewis truly encapsulated the crowd in the sort of sentiments that define the end of a night out <span class=\"s1\">—</span> bittersweet and empty, <span class=\"s1\">but </span>also a longing for <span class=\"s1\">the peak’s sweet return</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis has proven <span class=\"s1\">his ability to master a</span> myriad of sounds<span class=\"s1\">,</span> and if Wednesday night was any indicator of how effective his forthcoming album will be in telling the narrative he <span class=\"s1\">intends</span>, I<span class=\"s1\"> a</span>m positive he <span class=\"s1\">will be successful</span>.</p>\n<div

another year of stoner hippie magic, the Desert Daze music festival left quite a mark on its attendees this year. With exciting headliners such as indie gods Tame Impala, classic shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine, and Australian psych-pop band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, this three-day festival seemed like the perfect escape into a psychedelic wonderland.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As I was driving myself out to Lake Perris, Desert Daze’s new location, I got a phone call from one of my housemates telling me that she had been waiting in line for parking for over an hour. By the time I finally made it all the way out there myself, I recognized instantly what she was talking about. The line of cars waiting to get into the festival spanned over a mile or two until you couldn’t see where the line ended.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Eventually, I noticed more and more people either turning their cars completely off because of the stand-still, inescapable traffic or sparking up some joints to pass the time while they remained prisoners in their cars. Jocelyn Guardado (@GuardadoJocelyn) even wrote via Twitter, “First and last desert daze. Car ran out [of] gas from the long line. I love waiting in this heat so that my boyfriend can walk two miles to the nearest gas station.” Although Guardado’s case is unfortunate, several others claimed to have waited as long as four hours and still missed most of the Friday performances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">Once inside the venue, it was clear the anger from trying to park had vanished and most festival goers were once again excited for the music. Although Desert Daze, as the name mentions, is normally held in a desert setting, the festival this year made its debut at Lake Perris. It gave off an adult summer camp feel, with campsites across the lot, a beach to swim in and an amazing view of the Moreno Beach mountains. Festival attendees could be seen frolicking in the water as bands played their sets right next to them. In addition to the beauty of Mother Nature that engulfed Desert Daze, several fun food vendors and other booths were scattered throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Like Coachella and other music festivals, Desert Daze had multiple stages: the Moon, the Block, the Theatre, the Sanctuary and the Mystic Bazaar. Besides the Bazaar, which was for campers only, each stage was relatively close to one another, making it easy for attendees to hop from band to band and view insane, Instagram-worthy art installations along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Although it was apparent most attendees were mainly excited to see Tame Impala, the rest of the bands on the Friday lineup didn’t disappoint. Lesser known artists like Idles, Hinds and Jarvis Cocker shone as old and new fans alike were captivated by their performances, often taking small breaks from dancing to light up and drink. More interestingly, though, was the performance of Warpaint, who took the stage right before Tame Impala. Their psych-rock sound, in combination with the feminine edge that comes exclusively from a girls-only band, seemed to call each person to the stage with their hits like “Elephants,” “Undertow” and “Disco//Very.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As the sun began to set on the first night of Desert Daze, the weather became noticeably colder and more people could be seen retreating to their cars to grab jackets, hats and more joints. Though the main stage had been previously occupied by fans enjoying the sets of Warpaint and Pond a couple hours earlier, the Moon Stage was now filled to the max with agonizing anticipation of Tame Impala’s performance. However, it wasn’t until lightning started to strike that the excitement grew.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Scheduled to perform at 10 p.m., Tame Impala entered the stage about 10 minutes late, beginning with their song “Nangs” accompanied by trippy, psychedelic visual art that covered the screens surrounding the band. As the rain began to pick up and lightning became more frequent, Tame Impala quickly jumped into “Let It Happen,” inciting the whole crowd to collectively jump and sway their heads side to side to the familiar and well-loved song. As the long instrumental break blared out of the speakers, my view of Kevin Parker diminished as I got lost in a cloud of weed and vape smoke coming from my fellow standing neighbors.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While Tame Impala played for as long and well as they could, they were no match for the storm that was to come. The flashes of lightning continued to get so much brighter and more frequent than before that festival attendees began enjoying the scene, fully immersing themselves in the chaos of music and nature combining into one coherent experience. So, when the music stopped after 20 minutes and Parker said, “Sorry guys, we gotta go,” it was clear no one had anticipated this short ending. One of the festival coordinators then came out and assured fans that Tame Impala would come back out after the weather cleared up but that everyone was urged to seek shelter in cars or buildings. In the end, though, the Tame set was canceled as well as every other act scheduled to perform after them — and fans were pissed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">In an attempt to make up for the unforeseen weather disturbances during Friday, Desert Daze gave everyone free parking for the weekend and allowed attendees with Friday tickets to enjoy the festival on Saturday as well at no extra charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When Saturday morning finally came around, the rain, lightning and thunder had ceased, creating a cool forecast for festival goers to enjoy throughout the rest of the weekend. To close the show, Death Grips and My Bloody Valentine performed back-to-back, giving audience members unique takes on what psychedelic music can sound like. While Death Grips gave a rather exciting performance, never taking any breaks during their set, My Bloody Valentine really brought it home with their signature garage rock playing that incited enormous response from the crowd. This was especially apparent during their song “Soon,” to which many fans began jumping and throwing elbows and fists as a form of dancing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Though there were some pretty big hiccups with the organization and execution of this festival, Desert Daze still gave its attendees a great playground to meet new people, camp, swim and, of course, enjoy the music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hopefully, they will look at the weather report next year!</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Cuco started out by uploading his Spanish melodies to Bandcamp in 2015. His popularity soared with the release of his 2017 single “Lo Que Siento,” a track in which he discusses dreaming of love when he’s alone. His lyrics are seamless — even though alternating lines can be in different languages, English or Spanish, the song still flows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many students of the UCSB population, Cuco grew up in southwest L.A. county as a first-generation Mexican-Americanand can relate to many Dreamers here on campus. The artist is leading by example and through his music, exemplifying that being a Dreamer can make you stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco also identifies with and advocates for members of the LGBTQ+ community. “But what I think is cool also is that I see more artists of color not just coming from Mexican descent but different orientations with their sexuality and gender identity,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pigeons &amp; Planes, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he shared his humble start as a young independent artist: “I never had connections at any point to the industry. Like, my life was like literally going to school, watching my mom clean houses, my dad driving limos and every other weekend having a guitar … This is raw, this is me,” the artist said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco is not motivated by money or “making it big” with a record label; he’s doing music because that’s what he’s always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84210\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"899396935\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84208\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84210\" data-attachment-id=\"84210\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/marcos-reynoso_cuco_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1281%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1281,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Marcos Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84210\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3-656x1024.jpg?resize=656%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1199&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is Cuco following his creative aspirations, but he’s also helping his parents along the way: “Growing up, any first-generation child’s dream is literally always, ‘I want to help my parents out. I need to get my parents out of working. I want to pay my parents’ mortgage off. I want to get my parents out,’ and that’s hopefully what I’m going to do.” He’s making his parents proud not only through his music or success but also through his motivation to bring them up with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fusing traditional Latinx music with contemporary indie, Cuco is bridging the gap between the two genres and, in turn, creating his own musical niche. His eclectic sound is not like anything on the charts now. He took a risk keeping close to his roots, and it paid off. His sound melds old influence with his own beats, creating his personalized flare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many in the audience connected to his music, even though he is still slightly hesitant to fully embrace his craft. “I don’t know if y’all are going to vibe with my music, but sing this shit with me, alright?” Cuco asked as the audience erupted with cheers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being approached by record labels, Cuco has resisted, standing strong as an independent artist. Even though many refer to his music as “dream” or “bedroom pop,” Cuco’s music cannot be fully defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco has broken barriers not only with his music but also with his messages of tolerance, acceptance and self-love. “I feel like people hate that I’m a guy and I’m making this, like, super soft music,” he once explained, “so I like seeing really big white buff dudes looking all pissed at me because I’m on stage being successful and brown.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/","id":6630,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6629,6628,6627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miguel Closes Out Summer at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage presence of Miguel is articulate and precise, alarmingly reminiscent of the way Michael Jackson used to move about the stage and command his audience’s attention. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the first day of school at UCSB just around the corner, many Santa Barbarans chose to wrap up the summer with a night of innovative,  latin-inspired pop music from Miguel and his openers at the gorgeous outdoor venue of the Santa Barbara Bowl. With support from Nonchalant Savant and OVO signee DVSN, this performance from Miguel’s “The Ascension Tour” was as rehearsed, focused and high-energy as possible, with clear precision and performative value that is practiced, methodical and passionate. This show from Miguel demands acknowledgement of the strength in his entire discography and his long future to come in the music industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DVSN took the stage in preparation for Miguel, and the simple stage setup of three background singers and vocalist Daniel Daley with a mic set the focus solely on vocal prowess, something that Dvsn is very akin to. He performed a wide array of tracks from his three projects, showcasing his extremely wide range of vocal ability, namely his gorgeously high falsetto voice. Midway through his set, Dvsn had his DJ play some classic 90s R&amp;B for the crowd to dance to, which seemingly was a highlight but came off as a cheaper attempt to gain attention from the audience. Despite this, DVSN’s stage presence is undeniable, and the OVO wave of R&amp;B seems to be in good hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel took the stage around 9:15 with a full band, backup singers and a staircase set in the middle of the stage, in alignment with other variations of Ascension to come. He opened with various cuts from new album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including “Banana Clip” and “Harem,” all performed with instrumental variations and a free range of vocal runs. The rock-inspired electric guitar elements in his music play a much bigger role in a live context, as the sharp riffs cut through the air and added powerful sound to the performance. Miguel would later explain that the set is divided into three stages, ending in full ascension in which him and the audience “skywalk,” concluding with his career’s biggest hit, “Sky Walker.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

He had constant choreographed dance moves along to the beat of his tracks and with background dancers behind him. The consistent jumps, hip movements and flails in sync with drum fills, guitar licks and beat switch-ups were crisp, clean and exciting. He began to lose momentum, however, whenever he addressed the crowd directly. His constant rambling about “energy,” “meditation” and the “spirituality” of his performance came off as baseless, as Miguel’s image has always been more lighthearted and transparent as a neo-pop artist. Also, his constant priming of the audience for the performance of “Skywalker” seemed to be a ploy for audience attention. Frequently asking the crowd “Are you guys ready to Skywalk?” after every few songs seemed to have the opposite effect from what was intended. Despite this, the purely musical aspects of the performance were impeccable, with strong instrumentation, vocals and choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the set Miguel played a variety of older cuts from previous albums such as sex anthem “Arch and Point,” hit single “Adorn,” the self critique “So I Lied” and the revered, albeit controversial track “Do You…” (like drugs?). In cautious fashion, Miguel made a point to follow up the latter track with a disclaimer that all drugs should be done safely and in moderation, a slightly cringeworthy yet necessary message, given the state of drug use in popular music today. I assumed, as I’m sure many in the crowd did, that Miguel would take some time to honor past collaborator Mac Miller after his passing, but unfortunately that moment was not taken during the performance. This functions as evidence that, in the midst of growing older and more mature, Miguel has been at a crossroads in navigating his image of edgy sex and drug icon and his wise creative persona, and he may not know what kind of image he wants to sell at this point in his career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set ended with more cuts from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the Kali Uchis Spanish cut “Carmelo Duro” and dreamy landscape “Pineapple Skies.” He concluded his set, as predicted by himself and the audience, with his mega-hit “Sky Walker,” a moment that perhaps felt reduced after the previous hour of hyping it up. Regardless, the track was performed elegantly and with maximum response from the crowd, as “Sky Walker” marks one of the most energetic and fun songs of Miguel’s career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was more than pleased with the celebration of music, maturity and freedom that Miguel delivered at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Despite some flaws in his monologue and constant references to “Sky Walking,” the entire crowd was happy with his musical execution. Miguel is clearly aware of his talent and potential and will not hesitate to utilize these to the fullest of his ability. As the tour name suggests, Miguel has nowhere to go but up.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

groundbreaking about Troye Sivan’s journey. He has all the trappings of a star: a legion of loyal fans, a model boyfriend and muse status in the eyes of countless fashion designers. What’s groundbreaking is Sivan’s grasp on maturity and queer identity while simultaneously producing radio-ready tracks on par with today’s brightest stars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An openly gay Australian pop sensation, Sivan took a fairly conventional route to fame. A product of his time, Sivan first rose to prominence on YouTube, accumulating millions of subscribers with his daily vlogs. By the age of 18, Sivan came out publicly in a video, which now has over eight million views. He soon transitioned from YouTube to the music industry, in typical Disney Channel star fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first album, 2015’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighborhood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saw Sivan tackle the struggles of coming of age and coming out. The synth-pop album captures the highs and lows of adolescence, hitting all the usual boxes: unrequited love, identity issues and even the trappings of the suburbs. It’s the kind of album that could score every scene in a high school rom-com, with its highest charting single appropriately titled “YOUTH.” While the album showed the promise of Sivan’s eventual star status, its uneven pacing and crowded tracklisting reflected his rookie nature. Sivan still needed to do a little growing in order to find his true voice. Now, in 2018, Sivan is in full bloom.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, released Aug. 30, reveals Sivan as a fully defined popstar, confident in his own queer identity and powerful with his own voice. Troye rides the recent wave of “poptimism,” following the likes of Ariana Grande’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweetener </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Lorde’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melodrama</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, harnessing the fun and brightness of pop music in order to produce an album that is genuinely enjoyable to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Seventeen,” bridges the gap between his first and second releases as Sivan recounts his first sexual experience as a 17-year-old. The heartbreaking song tells of Sivan being lured into a meetup with an older man on Grindr. Sivan sings of the experience from a perspective that one only gains from actually growing up as he explores the motivations of his younger self: “I went out looking for love when I was 17 / Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me.” Rather than dwell on the emotions and politics of the moment, Sivan focuses on the curiosity and loneliness that drove him to the exchange. The thoughtful retrospective captures the naivety of youth and the mistakes that insecurity and instability can cause. However, Sivan is no longer that naive, lonely, gay teen and sings from a newly found perspective of wisdom and maturity. Sivan has already done his growing and is ready to showcase what it means to be fully formed, confident and queer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MY MY MY!” does just that, following Sivan onto the dance floor, where he commands attention with ease: “Don’t make me wait another day / ‘Cause passion is passion / You know it just as well as me.” Troye alternates seductive whispers and a booming chorus accompanied by an uptempo dance-ready beat. “MY MY MY!” shows Sivan at his sexiest as he coaxes the object of his affection into his arms. The music video released with the track captures Sivan’s command of his newly found sex symbol status, as he dances fully unabridged and fully queer in an abandoned warehouse, accompanied by shirtless men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan imbues this electrifying, bright, optimistic energy to the rest of album, which alternates ballads and bangers. The titular track, “Bloom,” finds itself on the upbeat side as Sivan not so subtly references “bottoming.” As with the rest of album, Sivan gives little worry to the binaries of sexuality and gender, speaking freely about a topic that has been given little freedom to be expressed in popular culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another upbeat highlight is Sivan’s collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Dance To This.” The two combine forces to deliver an ode to staying in rather than going out. At a time when Grande has never been bigger, Sivan manages to keep the spotlight evenly balanced between the two stars, as their angelic voices combine to create a soothing club track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s evolution as an artist is most obvious when he is at his most understated and vulnerable. Rather than pushing each track to emotional explosion and relying on catharsis to imbue effect, Sivan allows himself to shine in his most breathy, low-key moments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acoustic ballad, “The Good Side,” showcases Sivan’s sweetness, as the mature relationship retrospective emphasizes respect and empathy over the pettiness breakups often go hand-in-hand with. Meanwhile, “Animal,” an experimental ballad ripe with desire and longing, slowly builds until a Frank Oceanic release ends the song in euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s bright, fruitful and flowery imagery subverts the typical masculine pop archetype, perhaps ushering in a new era of artists who reject toxic masculinity and embrace vulnerability. Sivan produces imagery based on the queer experience; however, his masterful pop music is for everyone. Each song on the 10 track listing leaves a bright, harmonious and euphoric feeling in the ears of listeners, signifying Sivan’s rightful place among today’s hitmakers. Perhaps because of society’s slowly changing views on sexuality and gender, there has never been an openly queer artist quite so poised for mainstream success like Sivan. And with Sivan’s razor-sharp execution of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it seems like he’s more than ready to rise to the occasion.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-83945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Bandcamp</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski Miyawaki has outdone herself. The singer-songwriter, known mononymously as Mitski, released her fifth studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">via Dead Oceans on August 17 to seemingly unanimous critical acclaim. In an album so aesthetically different from her prior works, Mitski proves that she does not need to lean on her lo-fi indie rock niche, as she breaks out of her classic use of vocal overlays and grainy tracks as heard on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Puberty 2 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bury Me At Makeout Point</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski is one of the rare artists who can articulate feelings so complex, that trying to formulate the words to describe them usually seems futile. She isn’t afraid to broadcast emotions and desires that seem ugly or taboo because she knows everybody else feels them, too. That’s what makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such a standout: Every relationship is unique, but the corresponding feelings remain universal, and Mitski chooses to lean into the discomfort with an unflinching candor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Geyser,” is one of Mitski’s more cohesive songs with her previous work. The album begins with a hazy intro and the yearning lyrics, “You’re my number one / You’re the one I want / And you’ve turned down / Every hand that has beckoned me to come.” Unlike many of her other tracks, Mitski admitted in an interview with NPR that “Geyser” breaks from her traditional use of narrative and instead is “all feeling.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem to reference a lover, Mitski sings of her relationship with music and her career. Being an artist has led to her sacrifice of her physical and mental health and her relationships with other people. She skillfully personifies music as a partner, thus allowing “Geyser” to remain wholly relatable, even for those who are not so musically inclined. She ends the song with the woeful, “I will be the one you need / I just can’t be without you,” which is indicative of any passionate — maybe even unhealthy — relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second song on the album, “Why Didn’t You Stop Me?” portrays a self-centered desire for an ex. In this narrative Mitski finds herself feeling regretful after ending things with her partner. “I know I ended it, but / Why won’t you chase after me?” she asks. As the song continues it becomes clear that Mitski has a distorted perception of her partner and the relationship they had together, as she sings, “I look for a picture of you / To keep in my pocket / But I can’t seem to find one / Where you look how I remember / Look how I remember.” It seems incredibly bold for an artist to shed light on a relationship in a way that lacks a whimsical and nostalgic element. While the music may retain these undertones, the lyrics tell a different story of warped ideas of other people and even of ourselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most relatable track on the entire album, Mitski delves into the sentiment behind trying to settle the score with an ex on “Lonesome Love.” She sings of putting on makeup and high heels to prove to her ex that she has moved on and is thriving, but upon seeing them immediately softens and completely loses the upper hand. The melody shifts from an upbeat acoustic guitar to a more solemn tone as she mournfully sings, “‘Cause nobody butters me up like you / And nobody fucks me like me.” Mitski manages to completely gut her listeners (and all in under two minutes) as she relays a story that may feel all too familiar to many. She ends the song on a solemn note: “Why am I lonely for lonesome love? / Why am I lonely?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to her incredible vocals, Mitski is also a profound lyricist. She shows off some of her best songwriting chops on album-standout “Nobody.” Juxtaposed with the upbeat music, the strikingly sad lyrics once again touch on feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Possibly the most insightful verse on the entire album, Mitski compares her own desires to the greenhouse gases on the planet Venus: “Venus, planet of love / Was destroyed by global warming / Did its people want too much too? / Did its people want too much?” Breaking from the abstract she goes onto sing, “And I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me.” On this particular verse, Mitski explained that she views pity as the “emotion you have for someone who’s, like, lower than you.

One of the best shows I’ve ever covered was from the understated, classic rock-influenced Dawes. The steep steps lead to a charming, mid-sized concert space with comfy seats and a welcoming ambiance. Nestled in between office buildings on downtown Santa Barbara side streets, the Lobero was the perfect venue to showcase a night of rock and roll. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Biko Garage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking for something a little closer to our Isla Vista home, the Biko co-op house is a great spot to catch punk shows and open mic nights. And for lovers of spoken word, there’s even poetry. Biko is an orange house, named after South African activist Stephen Bantu Biko, located on the 66 block of Sueno. The house’s no-substance shows are held in the spacious garage, where Isla Vista residents crowd in for loaded lineups of local music. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The usual June fog hung over downtown Santa Barbara a few Friday nights ago on the south end of Olive Street. The low, heavy mist reflected the lights of State Street with an orange glow, and kids shuffled around outside the gate of D.I.Y. space Bici Centro between cigarettes and quiet words. The asphalt-covered space behind the gate housed 20 more people chatting among themselves listening to the first soundcheck. It was obvious that most of the people inside knew each other. There was a nervous energy that filled the air as the first band, Little Bitch, took the stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outside crowd began to trickle in as Rose Nadis, lead vocalist of Little Bitch, stood at the mic. Stragglers from the outside crowd, lamenting the five dollars they had to pay in entry, filed through the gate for their stamp and joined the crowd. The band seemed to swell as the show carried on, becoming bolder and obviously having more fun as their friends began to shed the cool-guy affect generally associated with being at a show labeled “D.I.Y.” –– which, of course, stands for “Do It Yourself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With whimsical lyrics and a healthy amount of power chords, Little Bitch’s sound falls squarely in-between Neutral Milk Hotel and Beat Happening. It’s easy to see where they are drawing influence from –– and that’s a good thing. As musician Ian Svenonius of National of Ulysses, The Make Out, Escape-ism and countless other projects said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this year, every good band is essentially a cover band. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dramatic climax of the set came at the peak of a song called “Pants-less Michael,” during which keyboard player, backup vocalist and band namesake Mikol Bitch (spelling as relayed to me by other band members while Mikol himself was hiding from angry concert-goers) tore off all his clothes and went careening into the crowd of teenagers. Most opted to part themselves instead of engage with the young man until he connected squarely with an unsuspecting friend of a friend, head buried in her phone mid-set. Mikol Bitch’s wiry frame connected with the girl and she subsequently connected with the asphalt. Mikol sprang up unfazed and charged back to the keys for the end of the song as his new friend charged straight out of the gate, learning a valuable lesson in show etiquette that she surely will not forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value of D.I.Y. shows like this is their teachable moments. The bands and audience are all one in learning how to put on a show. While it often feels like the underground has become pop culture in traditionally hip places like Los Angeles or San Francisco, the environment in Santa Barbara feels welcoming. The barrier to entry is relaxed, giving more space and an authentic platform for bands like Little Bitch to figure out how to be a band. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acts from Santa Barbara help each other. The series of shows this summer at Bici Centro is, in part, organized by Ruben Zarate, the enigmatic frontman of Santa Barbara-based Dante Elephante. With his own band experiencing some success and earning praise for their project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anglo-Saxon Summer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Zarate turned inward and is helping foster a new wave of local groups coming from Santa Barbara’s D.I.Y. scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zarate, along with indie label Last Resort Forever, are helping to fill the void left by the popular D.I.Y. venue FUNZONE’s closing last year. FUNZONE, which occupied the old maintenance shed for the batting cages on Milpas in the back of East Beach Tacos, came alive at night with youthful energy. As Santa Barbara’s only all-ages venue for three years, it was at the heart of the scene. Local kids had a safe, substance-free space where their music was the focus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a five-dollar donation, you got a night of music at FUNZONE –– a staple in the lives of those who frequented the spot. Spencer vonHershman, manager of the East Beach Batting Cages where FUNZONE resided, started the venue as an experiment. It quickly became a breeding ground for local talent, with a regular cast including Little Bitch and Cave Babies. With the demise of FUNZONE, the shows at Bici Centro are now vital to the survival of the scene and to the cultivation of talent in the 805 area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FUNZONE helped teach bands to be good members of the musical community. It’s understood in the underground scene that FUNZONE created a platform for alternative, indie and punk fans alike, and it connected both bands and fans to a sense of place that was once hard to find in an upper-class town with 21-plus venues and large stadium shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D.I.Y. venues along with self-organized house shows in Isla Vista provide a space for young alternative and indie bands that did not exist in years prior. Notable acts currently coming out of Santa Barbara, such as Clean Spill, Mellow Grass and The Anti Shiest, have created their own network, organizing shows that gather hundreds of people into Isla Vista backyards a couple nights a week. The big local names draw the crowds that lend exposure to the newer acts on the bill, and the significance of that kind of exposure to a young audience cannot be understated. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anti-Shiest is an act formed in Santa Barbara that has been paying their dues locally for the last few years. The boys have earned their spot as resident lords of the Isla Vista backyard scene. No proper I.V. backyard show is proper without them on the bill, and they do a large part in drawing crowds for new and visiting bands alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara] scene is fucking rad,” says Sam Deeley, the notoriously shaggy lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Anti Shiest. Often likened to a golden retriever, Deeley plays shows like a hardened veteran with power and a shark-eyed gaze. Through position changes, drunken fumbles and beer-soaked equipment, Deeley along with Mikey Threet and Dan Carrol have been making waves that stretch farther than the 805. “Anyone looking to start up a band needs to lose the hesitation and indecision,” the band agreed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sentiment epitomizes what makes Santa Barbara’s D.I.Y. scene so special — people and places like Ruben Zarate, FUNZONE and The Anti Shiest who share a strong sense of community and respect for the people and places that raised them. The D.I.Y. ethos is alive and well in Santa Barbara, California. Ask for help, connect with those who are doing it, and “If they blow you off, then they aren’t a part of our scene.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/","id":6621,"author":{"id":693,"name":"Sean Edwards"},"related":[6620,6619,6618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bon Iver Graces the Bowl with Summertime Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-08-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=807%2C454&ssl=1","description":"Throughout the first three songs, I felt disoriented and distorted.

I arrived exactly at 7 p.m., the time allotted for the opening act, and was serenaded to my seat by Perfume Genius’s opening few songs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perfume Genius opening for Bon Iver hailed as a true gift. Genius moved like a snake; he slid across the stage with ease and experimented with sensual dance moves that garnered a laugh from the crowd. At times he came into a complete squat while singing, melting down with the beat of his music. Complementing his charismatic dancing, his suave voice pierced throughout the Bowl carrying a smooth resonance; spontaneously, he threw in a few penetrating shrieks, naturally on key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was able to appreciate his talent much more as I had researched his background a couple nights before. An interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Yorker</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reveals that growing up, Perfume Genius, formerly known as Mike Hadreas, was the only openly gay student at his high school. He struggled with self-identity issues alongside domestic abuse, which led to significant drug abuse as well. Though unjustifiable, his tough life experiences add a complex and dark layer to many of his songs. For an artist that I didn’t know until four days before the show, Perfume Genius definitely surpassed my expectations.    </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He sang delightfully for a total of 40 minutes then bluntly walked off the stage after performing “Queen,” without giving a real goodbye. Shortly after his set, a slew of fans crept in for Bon Iver, completely stuffing a previously half-filled auditorium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 8:15 p.m., Bon Iver graced the stage like an angel heaven sent. They began the set with the first song from their newest album, “22 (OVER S ∞ ∞ N).” I laughed at the fact that an artist would choose to begin a set, or an album for that matter, with a song that opposes the very idea of a beginning. With lyrics like, “It might be over soon,” the song serves as a very cryptic foreword to the set. “22 (OVER S ∞ ∞ N)” was followed by “10 Death Breast,” a song that seems indicative of falling apart. The visuals to this song flashed sporadically in the background and gave me an impression of puzzle pieces that could be put together. The lyrics of “10 Death Breast” themselves appear as fragmented ideas rather than a continuous thought.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83804\" style=\"width: 817px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1081717378\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83803\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83804\" data-attachment-id=\"83804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/bon-iver-graces-the-bowl-with-summertime-show/bon-iver/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=807%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"807,454\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bon-iver\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=807%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83804 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=807%2C454\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?w=807&amp;ssl=1 807w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Consequence of Sound</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the first three songs, I felt disoriented and distorted. I began to forget the peaceful side of Bon Iver that lulled me to sleep many nights in a row. But the eerie and fragmented atmosphere was broken five songs through by “8 (circle).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“8 (circle)” began as refreshing: a soft and more divine song compared to those before. The visuals transitioned from rigid pieces, corresponding with previous songs, to a glowing fluid stream, pink and adorned with hearts. The song’s slow and airy nature moved into a grand quality of magnificence. This song may sound beautiful in its recorded version, but it was absolutely breathtaking live. I could not help but hypothesize that “8 (circle)” represents growth, a transition from a fragmented soul to one that is whole again. Chills ran down my arms as I sat and watched a dark, electronic mood shift completely to one of growth and power. I’ve watched “8 (circle)” live on YouTube from his other performances and most of them pale in comparison to the raw energy of frontman Justin Vernon’s SB Bowl performance of the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vernon took a break after this emotional song to introduce the band and then transitioned to “29 # Stratford APTS.” This song was complemented by a backdrop of five doors, which I assume represented choice and options. It became clear to me at this moment that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22, A Million</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tells a story, one of isolation and disintegration that evolves to one of growth and choice. Bon Iver told this story beautifully through their emotional and graceful set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They played “Blood Bank,” my favorite of their songs, with incredible passion and intensity. If I hadn’t known the song so well it would have been hard to recognize it immediately, since Vernon played it so much more powerfully live. The song is nuanced by the color red, with references to blood in bags as well as blood rushing to one’s cheeks. He played “Blood Bank” with a lot more energy and speed than is heard in the recorded version. His performance of the song was incredibly emotional and brought about a newer life to the song than I had ever felt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vernon paused in between his set to announce partnership with a non-profit, STESA, a Santa-Barbara-based organization advocating empowerment against and awareness of sexual assault. On the topic of sexual assault, Vernon spoke with conviction and wondered how people could be so horrible to other strangers they barely know. (You can get involved with STESA at </span><a href=\"http://sbstesa.org/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sbstesa.org</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bon Iver received a standing ovation that went on for a couple minutes, and, as might be expected, he came back out for an encore. Vernon ended his show with a solo acoustic performance of “Re: Stacks.” I was completely in awe by his concordant and lovely strumming during this piece, but I was even more astonished by his strong, high-pitched pipes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a chance to speak to UCSB third-year sociology major Dallin Mello after the show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He thought the show was amazing: “Bon Iver exemplified that his work isn’t just oriented around his voice, but also various other aspects that define him as a multifaceted artist.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His previous album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bon Iver</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was much more focused on a voice backed by instruments needled in between, whereas </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22, A Million</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> incorporated all kinds of synthesizers, intensified glass sounds and distorting effects. “Babys,” for example, integrated really clean glass noises that spun around the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello continued, “Tonight we saw his use of visuals as a way of creating motion and capturing attention throughout his performance.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His visuals completed the story that his music told as thought the backdrops were an instrument themselves, needled in the background of the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara Bowl was an ideal venue to see Bon Iver perform and to spend my Wednesday night. I’d consider shelling out to see him again because playing his set list on Spotify does not compare at all to the talent, beauty and emotion of his live set.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

In honor of the month of the Gays, below is a definitive list of new and old Pride Month Bangers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. “Bloom”- Troye Sivan</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troye Sivan, the sweet prince of pop, has been delivering danceable summer jams since his early days as a teen Youtuber. His 2015 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighbourhood </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gave us his first exploration of queer identity as a coming-to-age and coming out album, in which he explored the struggles of discovering and shaping one’s identity. However, “Bloom,” the title track off his upcoming album, finds a much more confident and self-assured Sivan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright pop song follows Sivan into a field of flower fueled metaphors, allusions and innuendos as he tackles the previously unexplored and unmentionable topic of gay sex. His sweet melodies and smooth voice take listeners on an intimate yet euphoric journey on a topic which has previously been ushered into the shadows. A music video, which matches the bright, colorful vibe of the track, explores both Sivan’s masculinity and femininity and questions the lines drawn between the two. The song and video shine the vibrant hues of Pride by turning a fun dance track into a vehicle for representation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41PTANtZFW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pynk (feat. Grimes)” – Janelle Monae</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monae, a multifaceted talent, has been nominated for Grammys, has appeared in Oscar-winning films and has been deemed a fashion icon. Her decision to come out as openly pansexual this year on her album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirty Computer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allows her to add “LGBTQ+ Icon” to that impressive list. Monae’s confident attitude and charismatic charm endows each track of the album with energy. However, “Pynk”’s artful celebration of the female existence seems especially important after Monae’s recent powerful statement of truth. Monae, a protégé of the purple man, Prince, finds her own color by imbuing pink as the color of feminine sexuality, power and desire. The romantic song manages to sound both upbeat and tender as Monae expresses desire and appreciation for women. Monae’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics create a playful dimension to this feminine, queer anthem. The song’s video, which features Monae and backup dancers dressed in what can only be described as “vagina pants,” perfectly accompanies the song’s sweet, funky vibes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaYvlVR_BEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Supermodel” – RuPaul</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before RuPaul had “Drag Race” glued to his last name and an entire empire, he was simply America’s most famous drag queen. Oh, yeah, and a bigtime recording artist. “Supermodel,” one of the most-fun songs ever to be recorded, imbues joy into the ears of anyone who hears its banging beat. As RuPaul commands his listeners to, “Work it, covergirl,” “Give us a twirl” and “Do your thing on the runway,” his listeners actually transform into runway models, equipped with fierce poses and sickening faces. After listening to this song maybe 500 times this month, the Hadids better watch out because this writer is ready for his Vogue debut. The song preaches the same self-acceptance and confidence which the ever popular reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” evokes in its viewers, allowing Supermodel to be a Pride Month dancefloor staple. This irresistible track captures the energy, confidence and love Pride pushes forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vw9LOrHU8JI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>4. “Chanel” – Frank Ocean</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2012, Frank Ocean became the first openly-gay major hip hop artist after he released his landmark album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channel Orange</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While Ocean’s dreamy, velvety vocals launched him into musical stardom, his idiosyncratic lyrics have pushed him among contemporary legends. On “Chanel,” a single from 2017, Ocean is in top form, delivering verse after verse that challenges and questions societal norms of gender, sexuality and success. Ocean’s lines flow and build upon each other, creating layers of meaning culminating in heart-wrenching croons. Ocean “sees both sides like Chanel,” and can “see on both sides like Chanel,” referencing both the fashion brand’s crossed “C” logo and his appreciation for his lover’s feminine and masculine sides. The quality of art delivered by Ocean makes him the queer icon we need and deserve. Chanel gives us an opportunity to appreciate all of Ocean’s talents, and that’s something we can all be proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnbsIl2BnWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>5. “I Don’t Want It at All” – Kim Petras</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Petras’ sugary-pop sound can only be described as a lollipop covered completely in Fun Dip. On her breakthrough single, “I Don’t Want It at All</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Petras is at maximum exuberance demanding — not asking — for all her wants and needs to be answered. If not delivered with Petras’ signature sweet and fun charisma, the song could sound flat and shallow. But with Petras in the driver’s seat, the song steers into the lane of colorful pop perfection. Petras first launched into international awareness as a young German teen fighting the German government for the right to receive sex reassignment surgery. After becoming the youngest person to ever undergo the surgery, Petras began writing songs and pursuing her dream of pop stardom. Petras’ mastery of pop signals that being trans and a popstar are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, her talent, charm and ambition proves her place in the future of pop and as a prominent figure of Pride.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9FA8lZRy8</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/","id":6645,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6644,6643,6642],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"route":"/categories/artsweek/music","highestPage":35}},"__N_SSG":true}
