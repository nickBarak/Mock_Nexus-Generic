The carnival has exponentially grown since its origin in 2012. Carnival-goers were surrounded by a plethora of activities including rides, games, and of course, live music. This year’s lineup was arguably the best yet, featuring an array of artists such as A$AP Rocky, Anderson .Paak, Erykah Badu, and Chance the Rapper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The carnival took place over two days, both of which consisting of around 12 hours of quintessential festival activities. Primary artists performed on two stages: Camp stage and Flog stage, with various DJ’s operating the small central Gnaw stage. The carnival grounds featured three Ferris wheels, luminescent slides, as well as other classic carnival rides. Attendees were provided with a plethora of eating options ranging from chicken &amp; waffles to Action Bronson’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuck That’s Delicious</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Chinese takeout truck. Similarly, guests could take their chances at carnival games to possibly win Golf merchandise or visit A$AP Rocky’s retro video gaming tent. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74335\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1952015201\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74324\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74335\" data-attachment-id=\"74335\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/camp-flog-gnaw-festival-returns-to-l-a/unnamed-1-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=743%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"743,743\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=743%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74335\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Maddy Judd / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?w=743&amp;ssl=1 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74335\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maddy Judd / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day one was kicked off with a soulful performance by Phony Ppl, a Brooklyn-based band that exhibits a sound consisting of vintage funk, soul, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. Two hours after the group’s set, Kamasi Washington performed on the same stage. Washington’s set was packed with exhilarating and euphoric jazz instrumentation, highlighted by the breathtaking talent of his band. At 4:30 pm, LA producer, TOKiMONSTA, took the stage. By this point, the carnival was in full effect. Beach balls began to dance around the sun-saturated sky as TOKiMONSTA brought out two surprise guests: Isaiah Rashad and Joey Purp. Rashad’s appearance was still in the wake of hype surrounding his debut LP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sun’s Tirade</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Joey Purp boosted the crowd’s dynamism with a performance of his quirky single “Girls</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A highly anticipated performance of Flog Gnaw 2016 was that of the Grammy-nominated neo-soul group, The Internet. Following a brief technical delay, vocalist Syd tha Kyd exploded onto the stage as the band played their hit song “Get Away</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  Tyler, The Creator made an appearance towards the end of the group’s set, then returned off stage to resume dancing. Chicago native Chance the Rapper followed with a mix of high-energy hip-hop and gospel-laced soul music complemented by exhilarating fire and spark displays onstage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A$AP Rocky had his own slot on Saturday. Rocky performed a variety of songs from old and recent projects, even bringing out fellow members of A$AP Mob such as A$AP Ferg and Twelvie. Rocky’s performance was a carnival favorite as he surfed the crowd and provoked mosh pits at various points throughout his show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler, The Creator kept the crowd on its toes by repeatedly switching from old to to new songs prematurely. In addition to his own tracks, Tyler brought out Rocky to perform “Telephone Calls,” a single from the recent A$AP Mob album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cozy Tapes: Vol. 1 Friends</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Lil’ Wayne capped off the night for the majority of attendees whilst Canadian producer KAYTRANADA headlined the smaller Flog stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than 12 hours after Wayne’s performance, doors opened for day two of Camp Flog Gnaw.  Sunday was equally as saturated with talent as the first. Vince Staples came out for Taco’s set to perform “Norf Norf.” Delirium 2016 acts Flatbush Zombies and YG both made appearances at the carnival following their UCSB Halloween special. After Flatbush was New York rapper [and chef] Action Bronson, who showered the crowd with culinary raps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Camp stage, Anderson .Paak and his band, The Free Nationals, continued to assert themselves as one of the country’s most exciting and energetic acts. Paak’s sexy, soul-inspired hip-hop and singing flooded the atmosphere of Exposition Park with funky beats and raspy hooks. Following Paak was the legendary Erykah Badu, one of Tyler’s life-long idols. Badu performed a culmination of songs, many of which derived from her critically acclaimed album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baduizm,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which turns 20 years old in 2017. Badu’s set began and ended approximately 30 minutes behind schedule; at this point, suspense surrounding the TBA slot in the festival’s lineup reached it’s peak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previous surprise performers included artists like Kanye West, so expectations were quite high. The slot was initially rumored to be attributed to Frank Ocean, though many were either pleased or disappointed to discover that Earl Sweatshirt would actually be performing with his once-estranged friend, Tyler, The Creator, under the stage name of EarlWolf. The duo performed Odd Future classics such as “Orange Juice” and “Couch,” as well as solo work. Headlining day two was Schoolboy Q on the Camp stage and Death Grips on the Flog stage. As fans flooded Q’s show Tyler headed out to the carnival grounds to ride rides and take photos with fans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Tyler, The Creator exceeded the expectations of many music-lovers and critics and established his illustrious carnival as a staple of the West Coast festival scene. In a political and social climate like this, it’s delightful to see people of all kinds come together and collectively enjoy the creativity of others.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

I came across concertgoer Dorothy Tang near the front of the stage and asked if she was prepared to mosh her heart out, responding by pointing at her five inch black heeled boots and saying, “These shoes weren’t made for moshing, but I’m ready to head-bang my heart away on the side!” This show was a prime example of concerts bringing complete strangers together, creating a safe space where chaos and camaraderie can coexist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three opening acts had brief sets before The Garden was scheduled to take the stage, reminiscent of a Beach Goth-esque festival setting. The second opening act Heyrocco brought forth a Nirvana atmosphere to the stage, building up to a grunge momentum and emitting songs about the never-ending wave of sadness found in a teen’s heart. Heyrocco’s union of engaging lyricism and thrilling instrumentation amplified the intensity of the purple-lit Velvet Jones. Once The Garden hit the stage, Wyatt Shears transfixed a laser-like focus on channeling a spastic diorama of sound. The bleak lyrics provided an addition to the polyrhythmic precision as Wyatt repeatedly yelled out, “I like cereal, but I’m not a serial killer.” The Garden does not rely on impressive theatrics nor grandiose stage backgrounds to get the crowd entranced, hyped up and sweating profusely on each other. During the performance of the track “All Smiles Over Here,” the crowd turned into a maelstrom of failed stage dives, checkered Vans flying in the air and Wyatt handing the mic to ecstatic fans so they could shout out the chorus. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Midway during the set, the sonic distortion escaping from Wyatt’s buoyant vocals in “Crystal Clear” created a journey of sensory annihilation. The bass riffs combined with Fletcher’s thunderous drumming when performing the single “Egg,” displayed The Garden’s stylistically diverse dynamic. The audience reciprocated the same chaotic energy that The Garden put into their performance, creating a symbiotic relationship between fans and the band. The eager fans erupted in a rage for an encore, pleading for one final song to draw the night to a close. Fletcher and Wyatt responded to their dire calls and performed “I’m A Woman,” an ode to the twins’ ability to defy gender roles. A realization hit the audience that perhaps The Garden’s songs were meant to be sung together, in a space where everyone feels at ease and accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd dispersed toward the entrance of Velvet Jones, people lit their cigarettes with sweat shining from their foreheads and exchanged words about Wyatt’s spontaneous dance moves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum up the show, second-year Chloe Anderson said, “The night was fun and interesting, but most of it consisted of me desperately trying to avoid getting caught and trampled in a giant mosh pit.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Garden provided a show composed of unbridled energy, innate eccentricity and polite fans offering a helping hand to anyone who dropped on the floor during the escalated moshing intervals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shears twins don’t adhere to any guidelines, rules  or preconceptions — they embody their own conceptual style of music. Their music is centered on having free reign on creative landscapes and being able to illustrate a panel of alluring emotions through the medium of unconventional sounds. In The Garden’s world, there is no focus on wanting to fit in with what is deemed to be cool in the punk scene. They dare to defy gender roles, genre molds and the tangents of normality.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6718,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6717,6716,6715],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Lady of Folk Joan Baez Sparkles at Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"For the past 50 years, Baez — a dedicated social activist — has explored forms of social expression through her music.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lights dim, spotlights focus and she steps on stage, donning a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt, a red bandana scarf and a smile that prompts thunderous applause. At 75 years old, Joan Baez appears as effortlessly cool as she did when she rose to fame in the 1960s as the next great American troubadour. Now, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award holder and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Nominee, Baez continues her contemporary folk rock legacy, most recently performing at downtown Santa Barbara’s Arlington Theatre. There’s no question that Baez’s command of the stage is nothing short of powerful, for after a quick greeting, she strums her guitar, allowing the entire room to melt into its seats, a collective release of tension.<br>\nBaez led with a rendition of the song “Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word” by the musician she helped bring to fame, Bob Dylan. She joked that she would sing a few Dylan songs in light of it being “Bob Dylan appreciation month,” referencing his recent Nobel Prize in Literature. Vocally, Baez fluctuates between her signature soprano trill and a mature, light, husky tone. The familiar tune prompted many audience members who had come with their significant others to cuddle up to her sweet and sentimental serenade.<br>\nJoining her onstage was her band, who appropriately entered wearing “Bad Hombre” T-shirts to accompany Baez’s own wardrobe, which was the first of many 2016 election references of the night. The team consists of Dirk Powell, who played a variety of stringed instruments throughout the show, and Baez’s only son, Gabriel Harris, who provided percussion. “Turns out she can sing,” Baez said of her personal assistant, Grace Stumberg, whom she also invited on stage to accompany her through backing vocals and little duets. The talented bunch even did so well as to steal the spotlight from Baez at times, especially in the case of Stumberg, whose impressive belt brought a modern complexity to the music.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74110\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1436783336\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74109\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74110\" data-attachment-id=\"74110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/3523-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"306,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"3523-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74110\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Arts and lectures\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Arts and Lectures</p></div>\n<p>Kathryn Krebs, a Santa Barbara local, reminisces “[going] to the county Bowl when the lawn seats were $5. I saw her when she played for Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers.” Another audience member, Martha Donovan, expressed her love for the song “Deportee,” claiming, “It’s so appropriate now.” Baez, who is of Mexican descent, obviously agreed, as she placed heavy importance on the song before performing it. Her version is touching, tender and a perfect example of how her music immediately impacts the audience, as it left Donovan dabbing tears from her eyes. Powell, Baez’s accompanist, targeted the crowd, mentioning that if the song strongly resonated with anyone, he urges them to vote in the upcoming election. In particular, he promoted his stepmother, Joan Hartmann, who was recently elected Third District County Santa Barbara supervisor.<br>\nBaez, whose setlist flows through personal anecdotes of her journey to musical recognition or her social activism, continued with songs such as “Prison Trilogy,” which she penned when her then-boyfriend, David Harris, who was arrested for resisting draft in 1969. Today, the song continues to hold significance to Baez as she revealed her tour is in conjunction with the Innocence Project, a program that, according to its website, “exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.” Baez even recounted the inspiration she drew from visiting a man who had recently been acquitted after 28 years in prison and his outlook on life. “He’s not bitter,” she said before claiming that it’s cases like those that call us to, as the song says, “raze the prisons to the ground.”<br>\nShe went on to perform many favorites such as “She Could Never Resist A Winding Road,” “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man.” Her most stunning part of the set, however, was the haunting “Diamonds and Rust,” an entirely dark acoustic performance, set in front of an ethereal and foggy background that left me with chills down my spine. Baez, who seems to find the humor in all of her music, tweaked the end of the song by adding, with a devious twinkle in her eye, “if you’re offering me diamonds and rust … Well, I’ll take the diamonds,” before nonchalantly taking a sip of tea, as the audience roared with cheers and laughter.<br>\nAs the concert progressed, it became obvious that for many, Baez’s music brings forth a collection of memories of youth and rebellion. The messages of the music, while more common nowadays, were themes that began a revolution for many of the adults that sat in the theater that night. “I grew up with Joan Baez. She represents all of the angst of growing up,” Krebs affirmed. Donovan added, “I first saw her in eighth grade. I snuck into this little club in Los Angeles, and I remember thinking, ‘We need more people like that in our world.’” Others discovered identity and individuality through the music. Debra Stanfield, who saw Baez live for the first time that night, talked about how Baez helped “develop what [she] believed about society.” Adding to her sentiments, Stanfield concludes that Baez influenced her as a person, because her songs “related to the needs that people had. I’m a psychotherapist, so I guess I found some personal meaning from her.”<br>\nTo round off the night, Baez answered the demand for an encore with a rendition of the traditional gospel standard “Swing Low Sweet Chariot.” The stage was a modern echo of her famous performance of the song at the legendary 1969 Woodstock festival. Likewise, the Arlington Theatre was transported to a dimension of nothing but “peace and music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/","id":6720,"author":{"id":709,"name":"Tamara Luechinger"},"related":[6719,6718,6717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morrissey Lights Santa Barbara Aglow for Dia de Los Muertos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=699%2C578&ssl=1","description":"As I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.

On Saturday, the plainly commercial space of the Santa Barbara Bowl was awash in a tide of local culture, and the walkway up from the front gate to the concert stage was transformed into a vertical street festival. Altars dedicated to lost loved ones flickered under the candlelight, and stray flower petals seemed to dance aloft on the voices and hands of missing friends. Tributes to fallen idols were in abundance; I teared up a little as I passed two candy skulls painted in the likenesses of David Bowie and Prince. Our own KCSB even had a small shrine dedicated to the programmers that have passed on over the years. In a patio area halfway up the slope, as I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.<br>\nAs I stood in the pit waiting for Moz, music videos and movie clips lit up a gigantic projector screen behind the stage. The mixture of Sex Pistols, New York Dolls, James Dean and Cher made it immediately clear that these had been selected by the man himself. When he finally did take the stage along with a band of dashing young skeleton men in shirtless tuxedos, the crowd responded like drought victims in a rainstorm. He immediately dove into “How Soon Is Now?” and the tremolo set us all rippling. It was a smart call for the opening song, as the dominant sentiment in the audience was something along the lines of, “I’d throw myself in front of a bus for Steven Patrick Morrissey, but he had better play some goddamn Smiths tunes.” Alyssa, a senior at Cal Poly, echoed these sentiments after the show saying she was, “very stoked on him, but he was a bit of a tease. I [wanted] more Smiths.”<br>\nAfter the cheering died down, he quipped, “I sure hope you all enjoy yourselves, because you’re all royally screwed come Tuesday.”  A Cheshire grin flashed across his face as the crowd erupted once more. Mozmania had officially set in, and he could now say essentially anything he wished.  Luckily he (usually) uses this power for good, and after a couple of songs the charming man paused, and the screen behind him lit up once more.  As he sung the opening lines of “Ganglord,” harrowing scenes of police brutality played out behind him. Men in riot gear dashed people’s heads against walls and shot dogs in the street, and the number of fists raised around me made it clear these scenes were all too familiar to the crowd. A round of sober applause sounded out as the last image of an officer smiling behind a riot mask faded to black.<br>\nMorrissey was quick to liven up the audience again, starting up with a cover of the Ramones’ “Judy Is a Punk” leading into “You’re the One For Me, Fatty” and “Ouija Board,” two of his solo classics.  Afterward, he performed several of his newer songs, and I admit the show might’ve lagged (musically) at this point. However, Mozzer’s signature brand of animal magnetism seemed to carry us all through the middle. The entire time, eager fans attempted to catapult themselves onstage only to be intercepted mid-flight by a group of expert bouncers. One man in a full skeleton costume was able to make it all the way and gave Morrissey a tender bear hug before a baldheaded man in a polo shirt sprang like a puma from stage right and whisked him away.<br>\nBefore the set’s finale, the Irish crooner took the time to thank his band, whom he described as “the best platoon from here to the moon.” They all bowed reverently and then polished off the crowd with “Everyday Is Like Sunday” and “First of the Gang to Die.” Morrissey’s dulcet tones were drowned out by a chorus of tearful voices, but not a soul complained. He gave the crowd a coy wave as he and the band left the stage, everyone in attendance knowing full well that the pause before the encore was mere formality. In another calculated move, Moz finished with the raucous Smiths tune “What She Said,” making a heady and frenzied end to the performance. As I walked back down past all of the altars, candles now blown out, I knew that Morrissey had done right by the spirit of the Day of the Dead. He’d awoken a light in all those watching that would never go out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/","id":6719,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6718,6717,6716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Election 2016: 6 Songs for a Young, Apprehensive Voter","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fc8a3eb0-400c-44d9-9378-d95b7a2e94ac.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fc8a3eb0-400c-44d9-9378-d95b7a2e94ac.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There is a strong undercurrent of apathy buoying this election season, and the brunt of it is being felt by us young voters. We are facing an unprecedented amount of pressure right now, trying to figure out how the decisions made by us and for us will affect our futures. Politically charged music has been created throughout the years for this very reason and have consequentially become classic anthems of unrest. There is a new class of songs that have been created with the same purpose and carry the same weight that political songs of the past did for our parents.</p>\n<p>Baby Boomers gave way to Generation X, and Generation X gave way to Millennials. Each generation of young people comes with their own set of large-scale anxieties and therefore creates art to serve as both a response and a relic as time goes on. Younger generations do not only serve as tastemakers in culture, but they also have the power to completely shift the tide of politics. This is especially important in this election because Tuesday’s outcome does not only have obvious partisan and economic implications, but monumental cultural implications as well. We can confront this in the best way <em>we</em> know how: Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol>\n<li>“Mr. November” by The National</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This song was written during the latter half of George W. Bush’s second term. The National seem to scrutinize career politicians like Bush: blue-blooded, Ivy League men who have consistently led our country. The titular “Mr. November” churns through an overwrought, aggressive internal monologue. “I won’t fuck us over, I’m Mr. November,” lead singer Matt Berninger sings in a way that strains his voice beyond comfort. The pressures leading the country pose to any potential leader are captured by the song’s pounding, kick-crash drums that carry the song’s angst to unfathomable heights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjszc2YOAE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>“Young Americans” by David Bowie</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For clarification’s sake, Bowie was British in every single sense of the word. Even from the other side of the ocean, however, he was fascinated by our way of handling political unrest: specifically, the widespread uneasiness that characterized Nixon’s presidency and how young people acted upon the way they felt. This and Bowie’s use of elements from soul music of the ‘70s, characterized the album <em>Young Americans</em> as a whole. This song is upbeat, which makes it easier to find positivity in being unestablished but still in control of our futures.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSHY1_ux8rs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>“Fortunate Son” by Creedence Clearwater Revival</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a communication class I am taking this quarter, the professor screened an advertisement featuring this iconic track written by war veteran and lead singer of CCR, John Fogerty. It was an advertisement for jeans; denim as a symbol of classic American ideals is analogous to apple pie. However, the professor mentioned the irony of this song being used in the commercial as a positive representation of being an American citizen because it is a blatant criticism of young men being drafted for the Vietnam War. America, of course, is not currently under the threat of war, but it is important to remember that although for different reasons, young people in the ‘60s were facing just as much — if not more — discontent with our country as we are now.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec0XKhAHR5I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>“Holy Shit” by Father John Misty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Singer-songwriter, amateur comedian and all-around magnetic persona Josh Tillman, also known as Father John Misty, is famous for his commentary on the state of love as it relates to everything. Whether it be religion, technology or politics, he glides through it all, acoustic guitar and silky voice softening his tongue-in-cheek criticisms. In this track from his sophomore effort <em>I Love You, Honeybear</em>, his disillusionment with the issues our country is constantly bombarded with is clear. He is a part of the group of people in the grey area between Generation X and Millennials, and his music reflects his uncertainty in his position. Tillman is well aware of how the problems we are facing are affecting us, but he is unsure of how to confront them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TXdtZLrsZc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of the many stories I’ve heard from my mother about my great-grandfather, one of the fondest is her memory of this song by Marvin Gaye, his favorite classic soul track. My own memories of him are blurry because he passed away when I was young, but I can imagine him sitting at the kitchen table, shaking his head at all of the confusion going on in the world and tapping his cigarette into an ash tray. The finger snaps and doo-wop singing in the background of the record give it a pool hall feel, but it is instantly elevated by the impassioned lyrics and string orchestration in the foreground. This song, like “Fortunate Son,” is anti-Vietnam, but it is more of a plea than a protest. With the current state of conflict within this country, this would still be my grandfather’s favorite song if he were alive. Because certain tracks have a way of bridging gaps between multiple generations, it is just as relevant to me as it was to him.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-kA3UtBj4M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although Dylan is practically the father of musical activism, this track is not explicitly political. “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,” he sings, as though he is soothing a crying child, and it is a sentiment which can quell the worry of almost any problem. Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion we are feeling this election season is uncertainty. No matter who you are voting for, the outcome this year is quite uncertain.

But tonight a variety of students found themselves in Campbell Hall long past 8 p.m. enjoying the fusion of the sitar and tabla drums along with the rest of the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was fortunate enough to host Zakir Hussain, one of the world’s most acclaimed tabla drummers. The tabla is a traditional Hindustani instrument that consists of a bass and high drum and requires intense training to skillfully play (with a complex series of finger and palm motions). Rising star Niladri Kumar accompanied Hussain on the sitar, which he specially modified to be an electrical “zitar.”</p>\n<p>As I walked toward Campbell Hall, it was obvious the building had been taken over and class was no longer in session. The enormous trees that often provide shade to studious students or the weekly farmers market were all lit up with blue and purple lights to signify a grand cultural show was about to commence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Upon arrival to the venue, I found a group of audience members following the instructions and dance moves of two Bollywood dancers. Arts &amp; Lectures had provided the audience members with a preshow treat; if one was brave enough they could partake in this dance mob and learn the Indian dance moves. Despite the slightly uncoordinated dancing, it was entertaining to watch because there was a sense of unity and commitment in learning this unique dance style.</p>\n<p>Once inside the theater, it was very difficult to separate school life from pleasure. The stage was set up in a very minimalistic manner, with an elevated platform for the artists to perform on. There was nothing to act as a backdrop so the audience sat in anticipation for the act to stimulate us musically.</p>\n<p>The crowd was made up of an even range of students and a various mix of adults from the Santa Barbara community. After some eavesdropping and recognizing students from my world music class, it was easy to deduct many under the age of 25 were attending the concert for a class requirement. Those over 25 remained a mystery for the rest of the night; some seemed to be genuine fans, but the sheer range and diversity of this age group indicated this duo inspired an eclectic group.</p>\n<p>When Hussain and Kumar finally stepped on stage it was much anticipated and well-received by the audience. The internationally acclaimed drummer blessed the stage as he ascended the platform, because, as he remarked later speaking to this quarter’s World Music class, “music is sacred.”</p>\n<p>For those of us who were not so educated in the process of Indian music, Hussain kindly spent a few minutes explaining the structure of the performance. He added a flare of his personality to this speech by livening up the audience and the performance with a bit of humor.</p>\n<p>In an improvised performance that was over two hours long, excluding the 10-minute intermission, only four songs were played.</p>\n<p>The first song was purely sitar and highlighted the talents of Kumar. This left many perplexed, as they had been under the impression Zakir Hussain was the star of the show whom everyone had congregated to this venue to see. But it was further explained by the pair that the sitar takes the lead in the song and acts as the “quarterback” the tabla accompanies.</p>\n<p>The first song had a long and lustrous build that left the spectators wondering what was happening and whether Hussain was ever going to play. But the slow build was worth the wait because the song had multiple climatic points that were extraordinarily impressive. The mad sitar player commanded the instrument with such skill and moved his hands across an overwhelmingly large instrument in a way that left viewers on the edge of their seats. In the middle of his solo performance he took smooth moments to tune his instrument; after over 30 minutes of this, Kumar joked this was the “long sound check we start the concert on.”</p>\n<p>After the “sound check” the concert transitioned into what everyone was anticipating and waiting for: the inclusion of the tabla. The team finally unified and played their instruments independently and harmoniously to one another. They would look to each other for affirmation to move onto the next segment of the song or to check in to make sure one was not overpowering the other, but they were also each happily in their own element, enjoying the dramatic solos they enabled each other to play.</p>\n<p>After an intense hour full of music and a responsive audience, the two called for a short intermission that was well-deserved.</p>\n<p>The second half of the show was just as long as the preceding first half. This section of the show was faster and more vibrant, which I did not think was at all possible after witnessing the more plaintive first portion.</p>\n<p>The tabla was the focus of the second segment of the show. Hussain really honed in on his talents and impressed the audience with his inhuman drumming capabilities. The way he played so many beats at once on the cultural drums by using different parts of his hands to strike the drum was astounding, and the will he had over his hands controlling how fast the tempo played was incredible.</p>\n<p>The concert ended on a cacophony of sounds that highlighted the capabilities of both the sitar and the tabla players. The finale was so tense and dramatic that when it finally concluded the audience leapt from their seats in uproar, releasing the tension they contained while witnessing such an innovative performance.</p>\n<p>In reflection of the performance, second-year Kristine Kazangyan stated, “I thought it was super cool how they played Norwegian wood.” She brought up stylistic elements I hadn’t even noticed: “It was cool that they fused traditional and pop music in that moment.” The duo had taken their traditional sound and made it accessible to the younger audience.</p>\n<p>The good vibes kept rolling into the next day because I was fortunate enough to have the two musicians visit as guest performers in my world music class. The two gave my class a lecture on what music meant to them and how they have struggled as Indian and world musicians.

The festival was held all day on Saturday and was open to all who wanted to pay respect to loved ones or socialize with people from the community.</p>\n<p>Just outside the building were booths offering a variety of themed activities, one of which was face painting. The people within the booth talked happily while one artist focused on painting a sugar skull on a little girl, who excitedly kicked her feet back and forth from her spot upon her chair. A second booth sold dresses and purses, as well as sugar skull tapestries. The last booth sold offerings such as rosaries and, right next to the Virgin Mary candles, shot glasses for the ofrendas, or ritual altars.</p>\n<p>The small venue was filled to the brim with Day of the Dead decorations. Paper marigolds were placed in every available space, paper streamers lined the walls, two shelves were used to present giant paper mache sugar skulls and a large, hollow cross filled with sugar skulls hung on the wall. At the end of the main hall, there was an impressive display of a graveyard that included tombstones, streamers and pictures of loved ones, all enclosed by a picket fence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ofrendas lined every wall, covering every inch of the space with a colorful collection of offerings. Each altar held several pictures of relatives past and was well-spread with decorations of fruit, candles, pan de muerto (or bread of the dead) and various items the deceased enjoyed in life. One ofrenda in particular held a black-and-white picture of a man in his late 50s, propped up next to a classic glass bottle of Coca Cola and a crumpled pack of Marlboro cigarettes. This simple but sweet display was enough to get anyone to smile. On a separate altar was a framed photo of a teenage girl wearing a yellow dress; on the frame was a yellow bow to match. Several magazines were placed close by. A larger ofrenda was placed toward the middle of the venue and was labeled “Our Future Leader.” This altar had the most pictures; the most prominent was a group photo of about 10 smiling men. People not only paid respect to loved ones who have passed, but also to those who have had influences on their lives. On a long table in the corner of the venue was a picture of Frederick Douglass and beside it was a display of Bob Marley; the display was crafted out of a shoe box and decorated with Jamaica’s national colors.</p>\n<p>The folks around the festival all had smiles on their faces as they not only enjoyed each other’s company but also enjoyed plates full of tamales, tacos and other delicious smelling food. The energetic live music flowed through the building and echoed off the walls. Although the band was not the center of attention at the celebration, they still enjoyed playing for children, parents and families. They danced around the small stage and gave huge smiles to everyone around. There were a few people scattered throughout the crowd who appeared to take a special liking to the music, and showed their appreciation by nodding their heads or tapping their feet. The sugar-skull-sweet experience of Dia de los Muertos left me with a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my chest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/","id":6714,"author":{"id":707,"name":"Kelly McPhail"},"related":[6713,6712,6711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Delirium 2016: UCStillBrazy","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Questions about the reputation of UCSB’s legendary legacy have underscored the anxiety surrounding the extensive security measures.

Given the greatly increased police presence and strict residential rules across campus, UCSB had been on edge since protocol began Thursday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Questions about the reputation of UCSB’s legendary legacy, the Halloween that put Santa Barbara on the international list of places to be, have underscored the anxiety surrounding the extensive security measures. However, the enthusiasm toward the annual Delirium concert has come to replace this lost spirit of Halloween, and Delirium has become a benchmark of the UCSB legacy. In the words of UCSB undergrad Clare Doyle, “music brings people together, especially big names like YG … it’s cool that UCSB throws concerts like this. Kids really appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration the length of last year’s entrance line, eager Gauchos began lining up for the concert around 4 p.m., four-and-a-half hours before the concert was due to begin. Heightened security at the entrance initiated a wave of fears about the ticket exchange. However, excitement in anticipation of the performance was nowhere near subdued, and hundreds of anxious undergraduates began clogging the underground pathway leading to the Rec Cen fields.</p>\n<p>Concert attendees trickled timidly into the Thunderdome under a heavy security presence. But once inside, the atmosphere changed; the anticipation for Flatbush Zombies compounding the waves of excited heat produced by the pulsing mass of concertgoers. The stream of entering students diverged into two paths, one seeking relative safety in the partially extended bleachers on either side of the main stage, the other merging straight into the throbbing heart of the concert’s ground floor.</p>\n<p>As the stadium grew increasingly packed and excitement grew exponentially higher, everyone began to wonder when Flatbush was set to perform. A full half-hour passed in waiting for the opening act, yet the evaporating energy of anticipation became displaced, manifesting in the body-heaving fray created by Flatbush’s performance. Interventions by stage security, which were primarily to save raving concertgoers from being trampled, couldn’t dissuade the movement and flow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73689\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"339560544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73689\" data-attachment-id=\"73689\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/meganmineiro_delirium-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=350%2C467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"meganmineiro_delirium-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73689\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?resize=350%2C467\" alt=\"Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The throng excluded no classic Halloween character, but some concertgoers’ costumes were lost in the sweaty haze permeating the dance floor. To one freshman, Marlena, the green spotlights radiating from the stage as well as the smell “made the experience”.</p>\n<p>The Zombies began with some of their more well-known hits, but, ever off the beaten path, refused to stay structured, instead choosing to freestyle while performing on-stage acrobatics. The Zombies’ shirts disappeared at the onset of the show, and Gauchos center-stage received a hearty surprise when one of the trio wormed his way to the stage through the crowd.</p>\n<p>During Flatbush’s peak, two stage-wide mosh pits sprung up at the demand of Flatbush frontman Meechy Darko, who refused to continue performing without a “real mosh pit.” The pit soon devolved into rave-like chaos, with Darko interrupting the performance to address the crowd on numerous occasions. His interludes challenged the Gauchos to reanimate a yearning Halloween spirit and were answered with deafening roars by the pulsating mass of proud and primed UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Before performing their outro, “Palm Trees,” Flatbush halted their performance so that a glassy-eyed and drenched Darko could command UCSB to “forget everything else we said tonight; if we leave you with one message, it’s this: O<em>pen your f***ing minds”.</em></p>\n<p>But the main course was still yet to come, following another half-hour of waiting. YG’s act succeeded Flatbush with a crowd-hyping session by his crew’s DJ. Gauchos were taunted with an instrumental intro that brought on YG’s companion rapper.</p>\n<p>A surge buckled the crowd as 400 stepped onstage after another instrumental intro. YG began his act with performances of classic YG hype hits “Still Brazy,” “Left, Right” and “Toot It and Boot It.” A fiercely responsive SB answered with a new wave of mosh pits and crowd turbulence.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73684\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"99159227\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73684\" data-attachment-id=\"73684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2142/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2142\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73684\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Around the middle of the concert, YG brought his performance to a halt, addressing the SB crowd with “Y’all UCSB, right? Lot of Latinos in SB. I love Latinos.” A brief speech about Latinos spawned an anti-Donald Trump tangent met with great support from YG’s famously anti-Trump fanbase.</p>\n<p>YG attempted to quell a coming rant on the candidate by stating, “I’ll save that for the end of the show… in the meantime, I brought a friend with me.” YG then introduced East Santa Barbara native Sad Boy Loko as his guest rapper. While garnering limited recognition in the crowd, Sad Boy Loko regained the enthusiasm of YG previous performance by joining YG in singing some of the duo’s hits.</p>\n<p>After Sad Boy left, YG resumed the concert with a riled performance of “Bitch, Who Do You Love,” another of his most successful and more recent songs<em>. </em>YG periodically interrupted the performance by addressing the Gaucho audience, asking girls to “speak Ghetto” for him and to perform other tasks in tandem with the concert’s atmosphere. YG also included a crowd-hyping interruption to throw some of his personal merchandise into the audience. The rapper and his crew then electrified the students with an extremely well-received performance of “Don’t Tell ’Em,”  his collaboration with artist Jeremiah, going so far as to freestyle from Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73683\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1578037408\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73683\" data-attachment-id=\"73683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2235/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2235\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Toward the conclusion of the concert, YG revived the Donald Trump rant he had refrained from performing earlier, espousing to the Gauchos that, “a racist is running for office right now, a man who hates black people.” Following more commentary, he asked, “so who y’all voting for?” and delved into his infamous track “F*ck Donald Trump” to roars of “Hillary Clinton” and echoes of his catchphrase, “I like white people, but I don’t like you.” Following two more high-energy songs, YG was played out with the final words, “You great, Santa Barbara, look out for my mixtape dropping Friday.”  Right before walking off, YG concluded Delirium with the answer to his earlier question, settling all of the Gauchos’ Halloween unrest, “UC still brazy!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The stage was brightly lit in hues of blues, red and violet. On Thursday night, UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts &amp; Lectures’ Roots series. Parker is most known for his work alongside James Brown in the 1960s and with Parliament-Funkadelic in the ’70s. After going solo in the ’90s, he began playing alongside legends like Prince and De La Soul.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The crowd, composed of mainly older adults and a few college students, sat in the massive auditorium waiting for the first act to go on. The room was almost completely full and many were buzzing with excitement, creating a very high energy in the room.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Opening for Parker was The Jones Family Singers, a band made up of family members from Houston, Tex. Performing in the style of gospel blues and jazz, this was their Santa Barbara debut. They had amazing stage presence, directing the audience to stand up and dance along with them. Their large vocal range rang through the hall as their five vocalists filled the room with bluesy lyrics. The energy they brought to the stage was so powerful that many people stood up and jived along while clapping to the beat. One of the main vocalists then employed a call-response method, successfully engaging with the audience by transporting them back to the roots of gospel. The crowd was so high-energy and so responsive, one could feel more than just the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The screams of the crowd were almost deafening, drowning out the sounds of the announcer. The music started and the crowd went almost silent. The heavy bass and strong funky drum pattern complemented the smooth sounds of Parker’s saxophone. Add in the brass trombone, a guitar and a piano, and the blending of sounds brought you back to the funkadelic grooves of the 1970s. Parker’s music epitomizes what funk is; the rhythmic tune of the bass emphasized the down beat alongside the jazzy and soulful blues. The compilation of intricate sounds blended together so effortlessly, varying between slow jazz and a faster upbeat, funky tempo. One could hardly sit still. Many were shaking their heads, tapping their feet and swaying to the intense rhythm. At one point, many had gotten up out of their chairs to dance to the music. The entire set was accompanied by shouts of love and encouragement as well as constant clapping and whistles. The legend played well-known songs by other famous artists like Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx, Marvin Gaye and Ben E. King. Parker continually sang in his deep, throaty voice “We love you,” engaging with the audience while also showing his appreciation. He made small jokes here and there, really talking to his audience, confirming his ability to connect with the crowd. The response back to Parker was electric and almost tangible. The audience grooved to the tunes as the sharp guitar riffs and the blunt plucking sound of the bass echoed through the hall. The energy, almost as palpable as the music itself, rang through the ears of every person experiencing Parker’s talent. The show ended with a very long, rad drum solo, and Parker played the crowd out. Screams and claps reverberated through the large hall.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">UCSB alumnus Patricia Oreño said that this was a wonderful time. “As a child of the ’70s, I grew up with funk, and I’ve always been a fan. I had so much fun. I don’t come to these events as often as I should, but I’m glad I came to this one. I hope they have him back because I will be back for him.”</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/","id":6786,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6785,6784,6783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Noise Serves up a Dose of SB Culture, Tunes","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9840.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9840.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This wasn’t a massive festival where you are separated from those performing by an endless sea of people.

Many of us can easily spend four years here without leaving I.V. and campus to see the amazing things happening in that wider community in Goleta and Santa Barbara. Though many of us will only be a part of it for four years, it has so much to offer if you’re willing to put yourself out there. This past weekend’s New Noise Music Festival Block Party was a great opportunity to experience the community and witness the unique cultures we are lucky to be around.</p>\n<p>A friend and I had heard the Block Party was the highlight of every year and were particularly excited about Saturday’s show, which featured headliners STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Making sure to get there early to see the openers — because you never know what you might discover — was a good decision. The Block Party consisted of a single stage and about a dozen booths representing different parts of the community, along with a Beer Garden, made use of by plenty of Santa Barbarans of age. With a little bit of time before the first of the four bands came up, we decided to visit the different booths before checking out KOLARS.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73523\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"341552210\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73562\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73523\" data-attachment-id=\"73523\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/6o2a9331/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a9331\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73523\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"KOLARS by Riley Esguerra\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOLARS by Riley Esguerra</p></div>\n<p>What’s astounding about seeing little-known openers is that you can never predict what you might get. In that way the tarot reading we’d gotten earlier at the KCSB booth had prepared us for the experience of a KOLARS show. The band features only two members, Rob Kolar, the guitarist and lead singer, and Lauren Brown, perhaps the world’s only full-body percussionist. As the two came out to start the set, Brown stood on a large sideways drum surrounded by two more drums and a singular cymbal as Kolar took his spot behind the microphone, guitar in hand. The song started and the drummer in the futuristic silver dress started tap-dancing on the drum as part of the percussion! Right then, I knew that this was why I loved seeing openers I know nothing about. Not only did KOLARS have a unique style of percussion, but their overall sound was spectacularly unique as well. The band clearly drew inspiration from many artists, from their futuristic outfits and electronic embellishments to the Elvis-esque growl of Kolar’s voice to the cover of “King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1” by Neutral Milk Hotel. With so many inspirations from all over the rock-electronic spectrum, the result was something unique but familiar and irresistibly danceable. Talking to the group after their set as they walked around and visited the booths, we learned the L.A.-based band loves Santa Barbara and had performed at the festival before as part of their previous band. After discussing Kolar’s inspirations, we asked Brown how she keeps up her stamina to dance and jump on a drum for 45 minutes each show. Brown says she’s able to do it because performing “isn’t tiring at all because it feels like I’ve just finished a good run.” The drummer’s “runner’s high” was just an example of how much energy the band projected out into the crowd during their set. In the end, we walked away with a USB featuring all of the band’s music. I knew then that New Noise wasn’t like any festival I had been to before. Something special was happening here, and that was community. This wasn’t a massive festival where you are separated from those performing by an endless sea of people. Anyone could go up and talk to them because they were just people enjoying the community like the rest of the festivalgoers.Before the next set, we enjoyed some cheap but delicious fully loaded hot dogs and checked out a few different booths selling unique hats, giving away organic, gluten-free energy bars and fighting for more ethnic studies programs in the area.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Even if the band’s sound wasn’t in your normal wheelhouse, you couldn’t deny they brought a lot of energy to the stage as lead-man Travis Hawley danced and got the crowd involved. Several times, the various band members joined the drummer in percussion, including an impressively coordinated routine between Hawley and the lead drummer Rico Rodriguez. The San Louis Obispo-based band clearly had a lot of chemistry together, as they started jamming together in high school. We had a long conversation with the lead singer about songwriting and the band’s fairly intense practice schedule. It was so cool that the up-and-coming band didn’t think they were above having a real conversation with fans, and it just reinforced for me the community aspect of New Noise.</p>\n<p>As day faded to night, Unknown Mortal Orchestra performed their unique psychedelic brand of indie pop-rock that I’ve constantly been playing on my Spotify since the concert ended. The band combines the soulful voice of lead singer, guitarist and front-man Ruben Nielsen with the beautiful keyboards of Quincy McCrary and the rhythms commanded by Amber Baker and Jake Portrait on drums and bass, respectively. The spectacular thing about their set was that the band descended into improvised solos between songs that went on for minutes and sounded like a jam session from a hallucinatory dream world. While the band might not be the most danceable out there, UMO’s music is perfect to simply close your eyes to and marvel at the remarkable skill and psychedelic nature of their unique blend of styles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73527\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1398288583\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73562\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73527\" data-attachment-id=\"73527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/6o2a9708/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a9708\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73527\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"UMO by Riley Esguerra\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UMO by Riley Esguerra</p></div>\n<p>The Block Party ended with a final performance by headliner and indie electronica dance group STRFKR. The headliner finished the night off perfectly as the crowd lost its inhibitions and danced the night away. The group, led by Joshua Hodges, clearly had a lot of fans as the crowd went wild for their songs with dancing.</p>\n<p>As we walked back to the bus, I reflected on the community I was a part of here in Santa Barbara. I felt a strange kinship to the people I had just enjoyed the festival with as the crowd eventually dispersed to different bars and restaurants down State Street. Soon enough we caught our bus and the festival was over, but the experience I had will stick with me. As we ate at Freebirds to cap off the night, I felt a connection to Santa Barbara and like I was a part of its community, and I knew I wouldn’t miss the next chance to see what else the city could offer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/","id":6770,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6769,6768,6767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joey Alexander Trio: Prodigious","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alexander’s original compositions are simply inspirational.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on the island of Bali, Indonesia, Alexander first encountered a keyboard at age six and immediately knew piano was his calling, jazz piano in particular. Not only could he pick up virtually any blues composition by ear, but he could also improvise with a level of experience far beyond his years. In 2014 at the young age of 11, the musical genius was discovered by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and flown out to New York for Marsalis’s all-star jazz concert at Lincoln Center. From there, his career took off. He’s released two solo albums and been nominated for two Grammys in just the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is Alexander’s first time on the road. He was accompanied by Juilliard graduate and two-time Grammy winner Ulysses Owen, Jr. on the drums and Berklee College of Music alum Reuben Rogers on upright bass. Celesta M. Billeci, executive director of the Arts &amp; Lectures program, introduced the band by simply stating, “I don’t even know how to describe what you’re about to see tonight except: Wow.”</p>\n<p>Greeted with tremendous applause, Alexander opened the show with a classic by John Coltrane called “Calm Down” followed by several original compositions. He received continuous encouragement from bass player Rogers, who periodically yelled out a supportive “yeah!” The trio as a whole was tremendously in sync; Alexander thrives in the syncopated rhythms of jazz. He studied classical music as a child, like the works of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, but always wanted to elaborate on it. Classical music is supposed to be played as written, though; you’re not supposed to embellish. Jazz, however, allows the freedom to express yourself, unlike classical composition, and you can tell it’s what the young virtuoso is meant to be playing.</p>\n<p>His bandmates perfectly complemented him with many impressive solos displaying their remarkable skills on their respective instruments. If you think Miles Teller was good in “Whiplash,” you obviously haven’t seen Owen, Jr. play yet. His hands moved so quickly they completely blurred. Rogers, the “jokester” of the gang according to Alexander, was having the time of his life on stage, yelling out and swaying with the music.</p>\n<p>Now, if you like music — which I assume you do if you’re reading this article — you’ll like Alexander’s original compositions. They’re simply inspirational. It’s more than just genius in its arrangement, it’s the notion of a 13-year-old following his dream and truly succeeding. Every silence and pause was precise and intentional. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel deep down in your core. It makes you want to get out of your seat and cheer, cry and grin. Many audience members shook their heads in disbelief. After the first piece, the woman to my left let out a quiet “Wow,” one you could only hear if you were sitting directly next to her. Everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>After the show, Eleanor York was more than excited to share her thoughts about Alexander’s performance. “It was phenomenal. The way everyone played off of each other and with each other; it’s amazing for anyone, let alone a thirteen 13-year-old,” said York, who has followed Wynton Marsalis as a frequent patron of the Arts &amp; Lectures events for years and knew when Joey got his endorsement he was someone to look out for. “It was just delicious.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a word other than “adorable” to describe the pianist, but gifted will undoubtedly suffice. When he speaks, though he is not completely fluent in English, he is humble and compassionate. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Hans Christian Andersen: “Where words fail, music speaks.” While Joey’s English may not be the best, he certainly makes up for it with his music. His sound and soul are much older than 13 years, and when he plays you forget about his age. This was evident in the <em>two</em> standing ovations he received.</p>\n<p>I was left with only one question at the end of the night: is Joey good for a 13-year-old, or is he just good? I think it’s safe to say he’s just good.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/","id":6732,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[6731,6730,6729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arlington Laps Up a Case of James Blake","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new.

As a curtain of fog swirled beneath their feet, a singular point of light oscillated back and forth across a great black backdrop. Like Blake’s music, it was minimal yet incredibly transfixing.</p>\n<p>The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new. “I’m gonna try and play some of my newer material,” he announced before diving into his famous cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love” from his self-titled debut back in 2011. This is how James Blake operates; he sets up rules for the listener, and then shatters them into millions of glittering bits almost immediately after they’ve been formed. During “Modern Soul,” for example, a pulsing white rectangle we’d grown to accept as a central part of Blake’s backdrop suddenly rotated into a brilliant, multicolored ring, leaving everyone in the room subsumed in the best possible way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although they were originally intent on retaining their air of ruthless politeness, the crowd of sedate Santa Barbarans were finally pulled from their theater seats during his <em>excellent</em> remix of U.K. dubstep act Untold’s “Stop What You’re Doing.” According SB local David Shin, “We didn’t expect this type of energy! For him to bring everyone out of their seats like this … it was unreal.” And unreal it was; I’d never seen a crowd dance in a way so sensual yet collectively understated.

The tawny synth maestro clearly loves putting on a show (I’d never known the Clavia Nord 4 to be a full-bodied instrument!), but after spending a set in his presence you get the feeling he’s there for the audience, not for himself. However, Blake’s musical performance really only made for half of the concert experience. The background visuals by abstract artist Matt Clark — current creative director of United Visual Artists — were perfect ekphrases of Blake’s sound. When coupled with intricate lighting changes of every shape and color on the spectrum, they made for the most thoroughly audio-visual experience I’ve ever witnessed. Apart from a minor technical which incited Blake to charmingly scrap a song in the middle of it, the performance went off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Nearing the show’s finale, Blake and the band finally gave into chants from the front few rows, tiptoeing their way into 2013’s “Retrograde,” Blake’s most popular track. No matter how many times you listen to it, there’s always a certain subtlety to Blake’s sound; it sneaks up on you. Even though everyone in attendance knew this track by heart, when it finally swelled into the chorus it was as if we were standing at the feet of an eclipse.</p>\n<p>Paying homage to his long-time fans as well as his own roots, Blake finished the set with “The Wilhelm Scream” from his aforementioned self-titled. The song is a cover of one his father, James Litherland, wrote. Even through the electric fervor and downtempo drum rhythms, you can really hear the affection in Blake’s voice. Through Blake’s traditional style of minimalist repetition, the song builds upon a wall of soothing reverb like a set of waves gradually overtaking a shore. The end result is a wall of noise reminiscent of one of My Bloody Valentine’s famous “holocaust sections,” but with the intent of melting the audience into a puddle of their own sentiments rather than reducing them to dust.</p>\n<p>After a scant few minutes of frenzied cheers, Blake returned by his lonesome to perform a serene, two-song encore. As his solemn silhouette casually lit up the empty backdrop, he serenaded us with his cover of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You,” leaving more than a few eyes in the room in a state of pleasant dampness.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73315\" style=\"width: 4414px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1575840009\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73315\" data-attachment-id=\"73315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/james-blake-arlington-theatre-oct-18th-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=4404%2C3146&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4404,3146\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct  18th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73315 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct 18th 2016.

So do you think you could … let this one just be me?”</p>\n<p>As I sat there mulling over how I’d never be asked to <em>shut the fuck up</em> so pleasantly again in my life, Blake, voice alone, began spinning the first verses of “Measurements.”</p>\n<p>“God damn …” a man in front of me whispered, clearly struggling to contain his whoops of pleasure. In the most wonderfully masturbatory show of musicianship I’d ever seen, Blake proceeded to harmonize with himself six or seven times over, his vocal cords weaving a veritable tapestry of sound. These voices then gradually trickled off one by one as people stooped down to grab their jackets and purses, and Blake’s set closed gracefully like the bud of a morning glory at dusk.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

But as they arrived, ready in their rain boots and warm layers, they found that Treasure Island was the grossly unprepared one. The festival was continuously way behind schedule and even canceled artists minutes before they were about to come on. Here’s the low-down on some of the ones that actually ended up playing:</p>\n<p><strong>Young Thug</strong></p>\n<p>After a wait of three hours — not 30 minutes of which passed by under a torrential downpour — Young Thug finally took the stage. He apologized for travel complications and quickly started his set. The crowd was very low-energy; after waiting three hours, it was to be expected. Throughout his entire set, Thug would try to hype up the crowd and ask, “If you’re ready to turn up, say, ‘hell yeah,’” but the “hell yeahs” were pretty sad. However, this didn’t last for long: Toward the end, when he started singing “Pick up the Phone,” the crowd’s enthusiasm was back. You could hear people singing and dancing along, with various shouts of, “It’s LIT!” during the song. Despite the rough start, Young Thug definitely put everyone back in a good mood by the end.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Glass Animals</strong></p>\n<p>Glass Animals put on a solid performance despite the short amount of time they had on stage. The creepy, cool voice of Dave Bayley spread through the crowd and gave everyone chills during “Toes.” The chilly, windy, post-rain atmosphere matched the vibes of Glass Animals’s set. Playing songs from both <em>Zaba </em>and<em> How to Be a Human Being</em>, the set combined older favorites with newer jams. “Cane Shuga” — a song from their recent album that isn’t very popular, what with its simple synth background beats — stood out like a hidden gem. Finally, Glass Animals ended with a favorite: “Gooey.” Everyone in the crowd was singing and moving to the catchy, buzzing tune.</p>\n<p><strong>Zhu</strong></p>\n<p>Zhu is a performer who is never afraid to change it up. At his TIMF set, one of his band members began with a guitar solo of “The Star-Spangled Banner” with a huge projected Zhu flag on the back screen. This differed from his performance at Coachella, which was a bit more mysterious with lots of fog and smoke. Both of these performances, however, show Zhu to be an artist who values production as much as music. Every one of Zhu’s intros and outros was remixed in new and unexpected ways. Many of the songs he played were accompanied by energetic guitar and saxophone solos, and he also sang all of his songs live while DJing. His voice, a high falsetto, only further adds to his mysterious, sensual aesthetic. The lights flashed black, white and red as the screen depicted hints of a cityscape. As the crowd listened, the combination of vocals and the dark visuals added to Zhu’s enigmatic persona. In addition, attendees who’d caught him just a few days before on his tour confirmed that his Treasure Island set was completely different. Zhu is always two steps ahead of the crowd. Toward the end of his set, he started playing “One Minute to Midnight,” but just as the crowd started anticipating the song, he immediately transitioned to one of his more hype tracks, “Hold Up Wait a Minute.” Zhu continues to push live mixing to its boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Tycho</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73362\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379438551\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73362\" data-attachment-id=\"73362\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73362\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tycho recently dropped a new album, <em>Epoch</em>. His live set, which was during the late afternoon, was a bit more mellow of an experience than many of the other acts. But don’t confuse mellow for boring; combined with his visuals, which comprised of Grand-Canyon-like natural footage superimposed with funky oranges and pinks, his sound seemed to take you away to another place. Although he played specific cuts from all of his albums, his entire set seemed like one connected experience with seamless transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sylvan Esso</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73363\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"949299361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73363\" data-attachment-id=\"73363\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73363\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73363\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Thought to be just a one-album project, Sylvan Esso recently released a single, “Radio.” This surprised many fans, giving them hope that they would release a new album. The DJ-singer duo who rarely tour was one of the more special performances of the weekend. Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath took the stage and announced that this would be their last performance before they dropped their next album, and excitement ensued. Amelia captivated the audience with her crazy dance moves and crazy-good voice. At this point of the evening on the second night, there had already been so much rain that the mud covered people’s shoes. But it didn’t matter: When she sang  “H.S.K.T.,” everyone in the crowd was dancing and pointing to their heads, shoulders, knees and toes as she sang the chorus.</p>\n<p>This was Treasure Island’s 10th Anniversary and last year on San Francisco Bay’s Treasure Island. The eclectic lineup and their talented performances were the main attraction. But while the performances themselves were phenomenal, the music festival was supremely disorganized. Some of the main acts during the evening like Duke Dumont, Flight Facilities and James Blake were cancelled due to rain or wind. Treasure Island advertised as being a rain-or-shine festivalbut could not deliver. Had they planned the necessary precautions for the weather or even communicated better about set times and artist changes, the festival would have run much more smoothly.</p><div

weekend and stands to deliver another fantastic showing of artists. Past years have featured bands like last year’s headliner and indie rap superstars Run the Jewels, as well as multi-talented drummer and music producer Andrew W.K. and YouTube violin sensation Lindsey Stirling. This year, over a dozen different acts will perform throughout the weekend with bands from all across the indie music spectrum, both locally and nationally renowned.</p>\n<p>Oct. 22 should be the highlight of the festival as STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra headline the first day of the New Noise Block Party part of the festival. Both groups are often described as psychedelic, so they should really complement each other and make for a great night of chill vibes and interesting sounds. While these groups might not have the same fervor and excitement as other past headliners, their sound really matches the relaxing beach town vibe of Santa Barbara, and the direction the festival is going is very promising.</p>\n<p>While STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra might be the most attention grabbing, plenty of other bands will be playing throughout the weekend as well and promise to bring another dynamic to the festival. One standout is Ho99o9 (pronounced Horror) which performs on Saturday night at Velvet Jones as part of the festival. The punk-rock flavored experimental New Jersey rap group remains well-known in the underground hardcore rap scene for their explosive, high-energy shows. The group, which has been compared to Death Grips, headlines the more hip-hop inspired part of the festival along with their opening act Ashe Blanco, a female California-based MC.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If Saturday doesn’t appeal to you, don’t fret.

Barbara. Wild Nothing is a critically acclaimed indie-pop band solely created by Jack Tatum in 2009. At the time, Tatum was finishing his senior year of college, but that didn’t stop him from releasing Wild Nothing’s debut album <i>Gemini,</i> which brought an immense amount of attention to Tatum’s dreamlike and nostalgic style.</p>\n<p><i>Gemini </i>features a variety of songs that showcase Tatum’s unique approach to creating music. The songs feature beautiful and whimsical keyboard sounds as well as simple but sweet additions from the guitar. <i>Gemini </i>ultimately evokes a sense of longing through Tatum’s dim lyrics, but still presents hints of light by pairing soft pop beats with peaceful rhythms. The initial song on this album, “Live in Dreams,” immediately represents the more somber approach Tatum takes when writing lyrics and creating sounds. Other songs on this album such as “Bored Games” and “Summer Holiday” are calm, beautiful tracks that force you to feel nostalgic for anything, whether it’s childhood, old love or a past memory. Wild Nothing knows how to be an innovative force in the current indie music scene.  Tatum effortlessly makes you grasp the sentiment and longing you’ve pushed back and tried to rid yourself of. The talented indie artist cultivates within listeners that it is okay to be feel nostalgia and to reflect on the beauty of the past. This is ultimately what Wild Nothing does to us with <i>Gemini </i>and this is without a doubt what to expect if you catch them in concert at the SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on Tuesday, Oct. 18.</p>\n<p>Tatum continued to develop his synth-heavy brand of music with the release of perhaps Wild Nothing’s most acclaimed album, <i>Nocturne.</i> This album shares similar stylistic traits as <i>Gemini,</i> but Tatum dives deeper in providing a more soothing and holistic sound for listeners. The leading tracks on<i> Nocturne</i>, “Paradise” and “Shadow,” are undeniably luscious, gentle and blissful songs. This album and Wild Nothing collectively are the epitome of ‘80s dream-pop, a unique quality that Wild Nothing brings to the current indie scene. Each song on <i>Nocturne </i>possesses delicate rhythms and soft, alluring sounds that paint light-colored images. “Through the Grass” and “Nocturne” are just two of the many songs on this album that give listeners a truly introspective experience, and this is what makes Wild Nothing such an avant-garde project in the indie music realm. Overall, Tatum does an exceedingly well job of crafting glimmering and echoing sounds with <i>Nocturne</i>, and provides listeners a simply beautiful, elegant and delicate album to indulge in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wild Nothing is definitely worth seeing live.
