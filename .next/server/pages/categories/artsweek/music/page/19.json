After some time trying to track down the creator of this delectable new flavor of lo-fi rock, singer and guitarist Ruban Nielson finally laid claim to it under the name Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Thus, with “Ffunny Ffrends,” UMO was born. Fueled by this pre-prepared hipster blog following, the New Zealand/Portland-based group hit the ground running, releasing a self-titled album in 2011 that gained acclaim from Pitchfork Media for its unique lo-fi garage rock sound with just the right touch of psychedelia.</p>\n<p>With the recent success of their third album, <em>Multi-Love</em>, it is no surprise that Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s upcoming show at SOhO has been sold out for weeks. You may know UMO from last summer’s Outside Lands lineup, though you may not have seen them given Mac DeMarco’s conflicting show time. Be this the case, I sincerely hope you’ve claimed your SOhO ticket, because an Unknown Mortal Orchestra performance is so grungy yet perfectly executed that it turns passive music listeners into connoisseurs and brings connoisseurs to tears.</p>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from classic jazz and hip-hop artists like Chet Baker and MF Doom, UMO’s vintage sound peppered with affected guitar and hypnotic bass lines is the stuff of underground rock dreams. Though their recordings are testament to this, it is impossible to comprehend the depth of talent each musician in the band possesses individually without witnessing one of their seven-minute intra-song jams during a live show. So, calling all lo-fi fanatics, all garage rock enthusiasts and all psychedelic devotees; this April 14, 9 p.m. show is the one for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/","id":6690,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6689,6688,6687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Preview: GoldHub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The instrumental DJ plays at The Hub on April 7.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69250\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69250\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"947142357\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69249\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69250\" data-attachment-id=\"69250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/goldroom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=250%2C203&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=888%2C722&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C650\" alt=\"Courtesy of nesthq.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>nesthq.com</em></p></div>\n<p>On Thursday, April 7, UCSB’s very own Hub is in for a funky night filled with good vibes as DJ, producer and songwriter Josh Legg — better known as Goldroom — will be taking the stage, along with special guest Matt DiMona. Goldroom is particularly unique from other DJs because his career began when he was part of the band NightWaves. Since then, Legg has taken on the pseudonym Goldroom and found much success by providing his fans with amazing and relaxing sounds.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based artist sticks close to his roots, as his name stems from the city itself. Legg sees LA as one big gold room, and this is what influenced him to choose the nom de plume. Legg’s first few songs, “City Girls” and “Morgan’s Bay,” were heavily influenced by LA and in a way were odes to the beautiful city. Being an artist from such a big city is difficult because one is surrounded by hundreds of other young people with big dreams. Nevertheless, Legg found his way in the music industry and has brought along some friends. After working as a solo project for some time, Legg turned Goldroom into a trio when he was joined by keyboardist/vocalist Mereki Beach and drummer Nick Sandler.</p>\n<p>After transforming into a live three-member ensemble, Goldroom’s sound has evolved into a mixture of tropical and upbeat production accompanied by soothing and melodious vocals. Since 2013 his performances have evolved into live shows involving four members, adding in a bassist. Although his sound is categorized as dance music, Legg integrates instrumentation and vocals that lead to a much more passionate and ardent feeling than the work of typical EDM artists. His distinctive melody has paved the way for him as he has made notable appearances at some of the most prestigious music festivals and venues in the landscape; for example, he joined reputable artists such as Flume, Mac DeMarco and Toro Y Moi at last year’s FYF festival.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goldroom is on his Pacific Coast Trip tour right now, performing in places ranging from Portland to Santa Barbara to Indio. Luckily, Josh Legg took some time from his busy schedule to answer some questions from the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some artists that get caught up in fame and materiality, it is clear that Legg has a genuine passion for what he does. Legg digs deep into his creative process and makes sure to keep his vibe unlike that of many other DJs.</p>\n<p>“I like to think of myself as a songwriter that happens to make dance music,” he stated when asked about the lyrics in his music.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that he produces his beats, Legg also holds the vocal component of his music near and dear to his heart.</p>\n<p>“Songwriting is the core,” says Legg. “The lyrics allow me to convey a message.” It is evident that he finds the connection between him and his listeners to be a vital aspect of his creative process.</p>\n<p>Legg sticks close to his roots and constantly finds himself going back to where he started: playing an acoustic guitar.</p>\n<p>“I was always playing acoustic guitar and writing songs. When I was younger I was always in band.” In fact, he also says that whenever he gets writer’s block what seems to help him gain some motivation is going straight to his acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, Legg urges others to “make a challenge for yourself.”</p>\n<p>His songwriting has definitely progressed since his first EP, and Legg shared that this is surely going to be noticeable in his upcoming debut album.</p>\n<p>“My songwriting has gone to a new level,” claims Legg.</p>\n<p>Not only have his songwriting abilities advanced, but he has also found himself embracing more performers in his live act. Throughout his entire career he has only had a six-piece group once, but he feels as if this helps in making his performance much more electrifying.</p>\n<p>“Performing live is normal for people who are performing other people’s songs,” states the songwriter. “This adds a unique flavor from other artists.”</p>\n<p>Rather than being close-minded, Legg believes that Goldroom is about trying new sounds and taking risks. “When I close my eyes, this is what I pictured Goldroom to be,” states Legg.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Santa Barbara will have the opportunity to experience the sensational and tropical vibes that Goldroom has to offer at The Hub on April 7. Doors will open at 8:30 p.m. and students can buy their ticket at the A.S. Ticket Office for $14 or $21 at the door.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/","id":6768,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6767,6766,6765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warming Up With Grouplove","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?resize=300%2C464&ssl=1","description":"Grouplove set to rock ASPB's Deltopia alternative concert.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69254\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69254\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1617806638\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69254\" data-attachment-id=\"69254\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/warming-up-with-grouplove/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?fit=300%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?fit=162%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?fit=663%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69254 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o-e1459509903303.jpg?resize=300%2C464\" alt=\"12419322_10154146504274558_8366641761584344629_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"464\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy A.S.

While this idea may seem appealing to some people, it diminishes the reality of what the band is actually capable of. No matter what Grouplove is depicted to be, they have a song for everyone, and this Saturday at the Thunderdome they will grace each UCSB student with the immense artistry that lies in every one of their songs.</p>\n<p>Grouplove formed with its five members in 2009 purely out of passion, and these friends were unaware of just how big they were going to become. After playing their first show mid-2010, they proceeded to go on tour with bands like Foster the People, The Joy Formidable, and Florence + the Machine. After just two short years of being together, the name Grouplove was on everyone’s radar, and before they knew it they were performing explosive sets at large festivals like Glastonbury, Coachella, Outside Lands and Lollapalooza to name a few.</p>\n<p>In the midst of these defining performances, the band managed to release both their self-titled EP, <em>Grouplove</em>, and their debut album, <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em>, all in the same year. <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em> features their hit single, “Tongue Tied,” and if that song alone is not reason enough to see them live, both the debut album and EP feature blissful, captivating sounds. The melodies tend to be contradictory in the way they appear when compared to the meaning behind the songs, but that is what separates Grouplove from other, more ordinary acts. There is no attempt to sound like anyone else, nor is there an attempt to market happiness by pretending to be happy. The concept that someone can listen to them and battle a multitude of feelings that have nothing to do with happiness but still feel overwhelmed by the forthcoming perception of joy is what makes this band so alluring. Their live set only amps up this joyousness, with the band members playfully and energetically hopping around to hype up their ecstatic audience.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although this is not the way that many people pictured spending their first weekend back from Spring Break, this alternative makes other options seem inferior.

Although the band is currently on what they are calling a “tone quest,” once they do release new music it will not be long before they are back on the road. At least UCSB students will be able to say they saw them before they took the world by storm.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Gnash as an artist is particularly unique because he is able to create his own genre with such subtlety that there is no room for comparison. Many have debated the idea, but he neither identifies as a singer nor rapper, nor solely a DJ, but just as an artist. Attempting to label his creativity would be difficult, so if, for whatever reason, necessity called for a label, it would simply be “Gnash.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash, along with Goody Grace and Julius, is a Los Angeles local, and he is certainly not a stranger to the scene. Performing at shows with artists like Kehlani, Mod Sun and Blackbear, his fan base has expanded enormously over the last several years. He has been friends with these artists for some time, so it is not accurate to say that this is where his fan base originated from, but rather it helped him to become known to the people who had looked past him for some time. His first EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is crafted as a vivid representation of someone who has loved and lost, yet refuses to let it tear them down completely. This is a common theme throughout his early music, giving people an inside look at his heart and mind while also letting people know that is okay to feel something even when it feels like it can destroy you. Gnash’s latest EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, includes this similar truth, but it is much more lively. As he stated in an Instagram post immediately following the release of the EP, it includes many of the life lessons he has learned about moving on and being content with being alone, a healing that is completely evident between the lines of every track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash’s music is all about his journey, and it makes it easier to get to know him as a person. If his sounds are ever too difficult to follow (which is nearly impossible), then it is a joy to get to know his personality through the updates he provides for his “dreamers” via Twitter and Snapchat. His love for his fans shows through his constant hard work and interactions, and there is never a time in which you would second guess supporting him. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to experience Gnash’s music live comes around often, but it increases with intensity with each performance. His energy on stage is overwhelming, and his ability to adapt to any stage or fan base is what makes his performances so enjoyable. If someone is not familiar with his music, they will be sure to check him out after the show. For someone who has seen Gnash a number of times, I know for a fact that he will bring everything he has to the stage. Everything he does, he does it for the people that support him, and he is never quick to forget that his fans are the backbone of his success in addition to his worth ethic. Velvet Jones is a very intimate venue, so it will only enhance the Gnash experience. Getting to see Goody Grace and Julius (who are featured on several songs with Gnash) alongside him is going to make this show go down history. Santa Barbara will be raving about these Los Angeles natives for days, and the lucky ones will be able to say they were there to experience it.</span></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/gnash/ihateuiloveu</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/","id":6773,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6772,6771,6770],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stwo Hits the Hub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?resize=800%2C530&ssl=1","description":"Ben Miller picks up what the French-Torontan DJ's putting down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68929\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-68929\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1018783640\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"68927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68929\" data-attachment-id=\"68929\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/stwo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?fit=800%2C530&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,530\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"stwo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?fit=800%2C530&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68929\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stwo-e1457427973700.jpg?resize=800%2C530\" alt=\"Courtesy of nesthq.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-68929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>nesthq.com</em></p></div>\n<p>The modern day musician has no stereotypical look. A market that was once controlled solely by major labels now boasts an eclectic mixture of artists that represent the many facets of society. Perhaps that is why Steven Vidal (Stwo), Thursday night’s man of the hour, was able to walk through The Hub and grab a drink 45 minutes before his set, without being noticed by one single person. The Internet has given successful online artists a valuable perk, the option to remain anonymous. While the name Stwo may be recognizable, the face generally isn’t. But this should thrill music fans, as, for the first time ever, pockets of the music industry are being pushed completely by the music. Vidal put on a brilliant show Thursday night, not because of a larger than life stage presence, but because of music that is simply put, good.</p>\n<p>Vidal may not have to worry about the same kind of groupie mobs that religiously consume the 10-foot radius of a superstar like Kanye West. However, Vidal’s online presence will give an intrigued fan some fascinating information to latch on to. He hails from Paris, France and currently resides in Toronto, Canada, where he has formed ties with today’s hottest music label, the one and only, October’s Very Own.</p>\n<p>Drake’s right hand man and producer, Noah Shebib, known to many as “40,” reached out to Vidal after hearing his 2014 project, <em>92</em>. A mentor-protege relationship has since blossomed, providing Vidal with a priceless foundation, chock full of industry guidance and knowledge. OVO Sound Radio, the label’s newest project, has featured Vidal’s mixes on multiple occasions. It must be nice to have worldwide exposure at the push of a black and gold colored button.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A little SoundCloud digging reveals a gold mine of Vidal’s work, dating back three years. He clearly favors remixes. However, two EPs titled <em>Beyond</em> and <em>Moans</em> display his ability to create from the ground up. Both projects were released two years ago, and what listeners hear as amazing production is likely viewed by Vidal as child’s-play. Producers learn fast, and with someone like Noah Shebib providing direction, Vidal’s skills have undoubtedly improved drastically since 2014.</p>\n<p>Vidal played an hour-long set on Thursday for a handful of UCSB students hoping to escape the quarterly stresses that inevitably manifest around Week 9. Following the theme of his SoundCloud page, he blended a variety of work, from original tracks, to remixes, to untouched party jams. His mix included multiple Kanye West tracks, Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You,” and of course, some Drizzy Drake bangers. A couple remixed tracks that underwent the Stwo treatment included A$AP Ferg’s “Work,” 2 Chainz’s “No Lie” and Sango’s “Middle of Things, Beautiful Wife,” a crowd favorite which deservedly boasts four times as many SoundCloud plays as the original song.</p>\n<p>Although his show was all about the music, Vidal’s image was naturally displayed by the way he commanded the stage. He didn’t talk despite the powered on microphone stationed three feet away; he wasn’t tempted to use it until it was time to thank the crowd for their support. His clothing was no different than that of a typical UCSB student. Perhaps this is why he blended in so well amongst the crowd before his set. A 23-year-old rocking jeans and an OVO hat on a college campus doesn’t induce many double takes.</p>\n<p>All types of artists have their preferences when it comes to performing. Many musicians, especially DJs, insist on wearing headphones or in-ear monitors to hear with more clarity. Vidal chose not to. Whether the audience realizes it or not, a performer who is hearing the same exact sound through the same exact speakers at the same exact time is providing an indirect sense of organic connection. No headphones means no barrier between audience ears and performer ears. Vidal’s nonverbal behavior provided the audience bond that is typically achieved through talking.</p>\n<p>Stwo at The Hub was a special show because it caught a musician in the ripening stages of his career. Those who attended will certainly look at future “band-wagon” fans in a told-you-so manner. With 30 countries toured and counting, Steven Vidal has already built quite an impressive resume. Keep an eye on the Frenchman from The Six; he’s not done cooking yet.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68927\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68927\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/","id":6772,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6771,6770,6769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Odell Fox Folk it Up","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Thomas Mannell covers Americana at SOhO.

The parents caught up and chatted, the young adults brought their friends and dates and the little kids tried their best to maintain interest. The band — the reason for the get-together — sang comfortably, strummed confidently and spoke casually in front of an audience comprised heavily of their friends and friends of friends. As a friend of a friend myself, I was honored to be let in on this secret fan club, getting to speak with not only other sworn members but the band members themselves.</p>\n<p>Raphael Odell Shapiro, Jenner Snow Fox and their manager/fiddler/angel-voiced songstress Lauren Tronick played a lyrically driven, bluegrass selection of melodies. Between the three of them, they incorporated a harmonica, a violin, a mandolin, a classic acoustic guitar and a gorgeous Gretsch resonator into their repertoire. Fries got cold and beer got flat as the band captivated the crowd, jumping from solo works to unreleased material, comical songs to hard-hitting ballads and selections from their album to covers of their esteemed predecessors.</p>\n<p>The songs from their only album, <em>Moon Shiner EP</em>, were the most well-known to the crowd, as seen by the more dedicated fans unwittingly mouthing the words to hits like “Waiting Game” and “One at a Time.” Because of this, one would expect an aspiring, relatively unheard-of band with a fully stocked merch table set up in the back of the room to be pushing their album as much as possible. This was not the case. As Raph put it, “Songs are a very funny piece of art, because it’s something you create, and you have to play it over and over and over, and it’s not really good until you’re sick of it … and sometimes an older song will just catch you by surprise and be awesome.” Accordingly, some of the best songs of the night seemed to be the less tired-out ones not found on their album.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One such song was “GGD”, a skeptical plea with the clever lyrics, “I don’t give a good God damn because I know that God don’t give a damn about me” and “I ain’t no rabbi, buddhist, preist or pastor, but I know I got a tendency to preach.” This was immediately followed by an a cappella cover of “House of Gold”, a song so wholesomely Christian it could’ve been featured on the “O Brother Where Art Thou” soundtrack. This polar pairing left listeners unsure of what stance was being taken, or if a stance was even being taken at all. In fact, the only stance the band took very strongly the whole night was on the unquestionable superiority of Gatorade to Powerade in their aptly named song, “Gatorade.”</p>\n<p>As far as their future goes, the band’s next move is to finish their tour and set up a new home base in Austin, TX, one of the most prominent music meccas in America. They’ll spend a few months embedding themselves in the music scene there and will then return to the “boring” jobs they have when not on tour: guiding white water rafting tours down the Tuolumne River near Yosemite (Fox) and teaching at an art school and exploring in Alaska (Odell). They will begin touring again in July, starting at the Tall Tree Music Festival in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>Odell Fox, as demonstrated by their SOhO performance, had all the genuine charm of an underappreciated, up-and-coming band. No money-grubbing gimmicks. No ulterior agenda. No bullshit. Just a couple of good friends playing good music with a good attitude. The treasure-hoarding hipster part of me wants them to remain underground, eternally unknown and underrated except to a proud few. The pretentious hipster part of me wants them to blow up so I can tell everyone that I knew them first. But what I feel is truly amazing about Odell Fox is that they’ll enjoy themselves either way. As they put it, “even if you play shitty shows you’re at least on a pretty cool road trip with your friends.” They therefore must be feeling fantastic,­­ because their SOhO show was everything I could’ve hoped for and then some.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/","id":6767,"author":{"id":722,"name":"Thomas Mannell"},"related":[6766,6765,6764],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Olés Return to Isla Vista","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Finals season is fast approaching, and what better way to end a grim Winter Quarter than with an astounding show from Isla Vista’s very own The Olés.

The recently graduated Olés have acquired their own enticing twist on reggae and hip hop supplemented with some classic rock. The combination is typically hard to pull off, but it proves to not be a great challenge for this band. The Olés are not only verified on Spotify, but they have an overwhelming amount of supporters across the state of California. Aside from their numerous fan base, their music speaks for itself in a very humble form of musical complexity. Their California roots run deep; it is apparent in their sound, and it is what gives them the edge that most bands seek: a mixture of soft vocals and electric melodies that no other band could match. This is what drove a number of I.V. natives to jump at the chance to see them in action.<br>\nAfter recently embarking on their Southern California tour, members Matt Tweed, Cole Leksan, Daniel Kearney, Eric Lordan, Nicholas Marks, Dominick Burham and Westin Byerly made their return to the town of I.V. and were welcomed back with open arms. A Facebook invite created for the event went out before the show, and its attendees totaled nearly 1,000 people for this long-awaited concert. The buzz surrounding the show via word of mouth was immense compared to the typical talk of an Isla Vista concert or party. It is not rare for people to just come across a band they had not been anticipating in Isla Vista, but for The Olés, there was little promotion that had to be done because all of their fans were doing it for them. In the days approaching the show, it was not uncommon to be asked, “Hey, are you seeing The Olés this weekend?” or, “Yes, I saw the Facebook invite; I am definitely going!” The closer it came to the day of the show, the more the anticipation increased to finally see the band that everyone and their mother could not stop talking about.<br>\nThe show lineup included sets from Atomic Walrus, Zeek Beats &amp; Caleto and, finally, The Olés. Sueno, and of course Isla Vista in its entirety, filled with the upbeat, radiant sounds of the band that we all came to see. Like any other Saturday night, you saw drunk people flinging their limbs in rhythms they hoped came off as dancing. Everyone was in sync with each other, and while their love for The Olés poured out of their hearts and lungs, the band reciprocated the feelings by giving their all to their performance. Whether it was the fact that the guys were incredibly in tune with each other or the fact that they were playing in the heart of the town they had a great amount of love for, it was one of the most emotional performances that an Isla Vistan could experience and the band would have the opportunity to play. Sober or not, there is no forgetting the union of the glowing lights with the gray smoke in the cold night that enhanced every chord and every vocal melody. Although nothing could beat seeing them where it all began, The Olés are stopping by Velvet Jones and a few other local venues, and it would be an understatement to say that they are worth checking out. Do yourself a favor and catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

guitar-tosses on stage and a dance frenzy ensued last Thursday as HUNNY shared the Velvet Jones stage with tour mates Kid Cadaver and Armors.</p>\n<p>Kid Cadaver opened up the night with neon electro pop with a slight punk formula that emulated the likes of State Champs and Tokyo Police Club. Their song “Let Your Youth Show” brought forth a dance wave in the audience with the coupling of a wistful chorus and melodic hook. The band’s enthusiastic personalities could be reflected onto their unicorn socks paired with Creepers to their playful banter with the crowd. Kid Cadaver’s electrifying performance was met with applause and off-pitch screams from all the alternative kids that had only came for HUNNY.</p>\n<p>The OC-based band Armors, the second band of the night, left me craving an espresso shot as the band began to lose their momentum in the midst of their set. Their sound replicated a “great value brand” Twenty One Pilots with a messy stylistic blend of electronic, rock and rap. Unfortunately, they just ended up sounding like pop chameleons trying to mask their indie pop sound in several genres. During the lull of their performance, I was attentive toward the sounds escaping the synth and keyboard player, Sam Beresford, who happens to be a UCSB alumnus. I suggest that he should commit a Zayn and leave his underwhelming band for his own good. Since the previous five-piece shrunk down to three, lead vocalist Olen simultaneously sang and drummed while standing up. They have the whole energetic sound intact, but the dark undertones ended up casting a spell on their genuine lightheartedness. Their song “Parasite” was the standout of their lengthy set list, the only part that roused me enough to wake up.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As HUNNY began to take the stage, the glitter-clad six-piece sauntered around each other and exchanged laughter when they hit the wrong chords. I spoke with an impatient Morgan McIntyre, who had recently seen HUNNY alongside the Neighbourhood last year.</p>\n<p>“HUNNY reminds me of all the rock influences I grew up on, and they all look like they just stepped out of Goodwill, which only adds to their whole ’90s bully aesthetic.”</p>\n<p>The ’90s bullies opened the show with “Natalie,” despite the heartrending profundity within this song, the combined background of the Velvet Jones’ faux New York skyline and lead singer Jason Yarger’s drunken slurring of “It’s been a week or 15, Natalie hasn’t said a word to me,” devoured the audience. Yarger crooned over the microphone with wine in one hand, only letting it down to begin his lurid guitar layering. During the middle of the set, after their performance of “Cry for Me,” Yarger threw his guitar on stage and took a one minute break to the bathroom, which left the audience in a state of confusion while the rest of the band continued with an extended instrumental. After HUNNY finished performing every song off their notable EP, they ended the set with new songs. Yarger kept profusely apologizing for the slew of new songs which had fans guessing at lyrics.</p>\n<p>The energy from the audience, hardly larger than 40 people, became immensely more fluid when the band belted out “Parking Lot,” an immaculate performance from Kevin Grimmett who provided stabbing synths. Yarger kept obnoxiously rocking the mic back and forth as I held out my right hand since death by a microphone falling on me is not one of the things on my bucket list. The intimacy of the venue allowed me to be sprayed in the face by Yarger’s spit during the “July” performance, possibly a pivotal point of my life. HUNNY’s fuse of slinky ’80s-style post-punk vocals, layered guitar riffs and genre-defying sound brings them a future of moving on from venues that have a capacity of 100 people to selling out arenas. My suggestion is to go experience an intimate, angst-ridden HUNNY show before they start selling tickets at a $60 price tag.</p>\n<p>Overall, the show was worth losing my hearing for about one hour after HUNNY wrapped up their performance and getting spit in my eye. I was faced with a revitalization for post-punk music, leaving me wanting to star in a ’80s movie with The Cure playing in the background.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

On Tuesday, March 1, Odell Fox is coming to SOhO in the second-to-last leg of their first tour ever. At 7:30 p.m., you can witness Raphael Odell Shapiro and Jenner Snow Fox soothe the soul and convince your parents that not <em>all</em> of our generation’s music is trash.</p>\n<p>Shapiro and Fox share a love for acoustic singing-songwriting, the great outdoors and “the next great American sport,” Spikeball. Moreover, as recent college graduates, they share the experience of stumbling out into the big bad world and giving it a go. Conveniently for us Gauchos, they have worked their newfound knowledge into their first EP, <em>Moon Shine</em><em>r</em>, a bluegrass-based, Americana armada of passionate tunes. With songs like “Waiting Game,” and “One at a Time,” they reflect on the shared dream of many twentysomethings that are abandoning the sedentary nine-to-five “successful” waiting game to welcome the struggles of following their passions and taking each step one at a time.</p>\n<p>The two met at Yale, where Fox was recruited to play collegiate soccer and Shapiro was recruited for musical theatre. The two eventually crossed paths in the Yale folk roots chorus, Tangled Up In Blue, where they toured together for three years and then went their separate ways. Shapiro began touring in an a capella group, the Yale Whiffenpoofs, and then graduated with the most folk-favoring degree a college boy can get: American Studies, focusing on cultural history and American storytelling. Fox graduated with the most scientific music degree possible: Cognitive Science, focusing on music and the mind. Shaprio moved to New York to make it big as an actor and Fox moved back to Oregon to work in the family business as a river tour guide. They each released their own solo album and something must’ve clicked because in less than year they decided to relive their days as Yale boys. In their unique case, this meant making folk music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just last winter, they got serious about their whole “dropping everything and making it as a musician” thing and moved in together in Palo Alto at Jenner’s parents house.

electronic music festival is invoked, a number of images are generally called to mind: booming bass music, fuzzy leggings and, perhaps, some night clubbers on a weekend getaway. On Memorial Day Weekend, May 20 to 25, Lightning in a Bottle will be shedding almost all electronic festival stereotypes in an effort to reimagine the festival experience.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the California-based production company The Do LaB, Lightning in a Bottle will be celebrating its 16th birthday this year in the scenic central coast town of Bradley, CA. The Do LaB’s main goal is to tackle the music festival experience with a mind for showcasing visual arts, curating immersive workshops, promoting environmental sustainability and, of course, offering the best in alternative electronica. If you haven’t made the pilgrimage to LiB before or are on the fence, listen up.</p>\n<p>One of the big draws of LiB is the sheer number of world-renowned minds that come to host lectures and workshops. The Temple of Consciousness will offer yoga sessions, discussions on spirituality and the occasional musician. If you find yourself working up an appetite from an early morning meditation session, your next destination will be The Learning Kitchen, which offers a host of various nutritional workshops and the necessitated tasting samples.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At LiB music is less the main attraction and more of a conduit for creating a transformative festival experience. However, the festival still manages to boast one of the most impressive lineups in the indie electronic scene. LiB will be headlined by festival circuit veterans Chet Faker, Grimes, Big Gigantic and Jamie xx. The undercard is also sporting a number of big bass acts in the form of Mija, G Jones, Four Tet and Hayden James. If you’re looking for a divergence from the typical festival formula or even just an early summer vacation, Bradley, CA on Memorial Day weekend is the destination for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Chanting and clapping, the Los Angeles-based band emerged from behind the curtain and stationed themselves near one of the 13 glistening instruments positioned all over the stage before jumping into some tracks from their debut album, <em>Tropicoso</em>.</p>\n<p>Although the wedding band look of crisp, white button-ups, fedoras and five-o-clock shadows may be misleading, this 10-member collective knows how to keep the crowd out of their seat. While the band maintained a mild two-step throughout their performance, the fusion of 1970s funk and Afro-Latin dance rhythms moved the crowd beyond a simple two-step. Led by somebody’s father in the front row, the second the percussion instruments rang throughout the theatre, people whipped out some funky moves to the funk-filled tunes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The audience’s acceptance of the “Firewalker” artists’ dependence on instruments and an absence of lyrics illustrates that music is all about energy. The rattling of the West African shekere, the booming Cuban congas and piercing American electric guitar meshed together to create undeniable dance tunes for those from all walks of life. Santa Barbara resident Betsy Brenner praised such combinations.</p>\n<p>“I like the way the different rhythms come together, the drums with the cow bells,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the drums echoed throughout the theatre and the horns screeched, zebra-striped ponytails swung from shoulder to shoulder alongside hip-twisting neighbors. Everyone was connected through the complex fusion of Jungle Fire, unbothered by anything outside the rhythms.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara first-timers reiterate these sentiments of interconnectedness as they shared the development of their sound. One member shared that a particular song developed as they witnessed some children in an alley toying with a melody before allowing one of the guitarist to record their efforts, later transforming it to create their own track. Although there are no lyrics offering an explicit message, their blending of cultures through their sound and sources of inspiration conveys to listeners the positive interactions and feelings that arise when people embrace the fact that everyone is interconnected.</p>\n<p>While Jungle Fire steers clear of melodies, their special guest, Alan James, brought lyrics and powerful vocals to complement the soulful beats. As James bellowed, giving Bruno Mars a run for his money in the funk realm, he maintained the clapping ignited by the composers. Together, they bounced near the grounds symbolizing the breakdown in the beat before bouncing upwards with an increase in instrumentation to accompany James’ exclamations of “gotta get myself together, gonna get higher.” As James’ appearance came to an end, the collective directed more rapid clapping and declared, “it’s getting ready to be that time” before the lights dimmed to pink.</p>\n<p>As the show approached its end, the band aimed to leave the crowd in the highest spirits possible. Abandoning their two-step, the groovy group entertained an occasional jump and clink of drumsticks. The three percussion players stationed at the front of the stage maintained the excitement through their version of musical chairs as they bounced from one instrument to the next with the seemingly permanent smirks of all band members widening.</p>\n<p>While one concertgoer plopped down in her chair with her head dangling over, most attendees were able to drag themselves out of the MCC theatre and examine hard copies of the music that tired their bodies.

Sunday and Monday nights.</p>\n<p>The backdrop transitioned from blue to amber behind dozens of speakers stacked up, as if prepared for a rock show. But the music seemed to emanate directly from the instruments themselves. Kayhan Kalhor, an internationally known musician, slowly began playing the kamancheh, an Iranian stringed instrument. After four minutes of solo play, more than 20 members of the ensemble picked up their violins, clarinets and bass, adding to Kalhor’s skillful strumming.</p>\n<p>Ma was the last person to begin playing, and while many of those in the audience likely came to see him, it was members of the ensemble who were front and center for much of the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cristina Pato, bagpipes player for the Silk Road Ensemble from Galicia, Spain, said that “In Galicia, playing bagpipes is like playing soccer — you only have two choices.”</p>\n<p>She said that in the United States, many refer to Hispanic women as simply “Latina,” rather than focusing on their accomplishments or profession.</p>\n<p>“In Galicia, I was known as the Galician Bagpiper,” Pato said. “When I moved to the U.S., I was called Latina.”</p>\n<p>Then she burst into a song, filling the theatre with the high-pitched screams of her bagpipe as she swayed her hips and danced around the stage. The clarinetist gyrated, swinging from side to side and looking at his fellow musicians with emphatic smiles. Many of the other musicians also danced and moved around while playing, but Ma simply focused on his cello with serious ferocity, surely knowing that the audience’s eyes were flying back to him after every measure.</p>\n<p>This seriousness was contrasted at one point by a man who began using his own body for percussion, slapping his thighs, chest and at one point his buttocks, resulting in a scream from an elderly woman next to me.</p>\n<p>During one brief break from the music, a violinist said that the ensemble loved coming to Santa Barbara because of the dining options.</p>\n<p>“Musicians, they live for food,” he said. “We’ve been feasting on Lilly’s Tacos. We’re going to try and feed you back food for the soul.”</p>\n<p>When the audience returned from intermission, only four musicians took the stage, including a clarinetist, a cellist, Kalhor and Sandeep Das, who played the tabla — an eastern percussion instrument. Das went back and forth with Kalhor, challenging him with more and more complex rhythms.</p>\n<p>The instruments created such strong vibrations that it sounded like there were six musicians on stage even though often only three of the four were playing.</p>\n<p>Das said the quartet’s music was “about how we meet, about how we fall in love, about how we learn about each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>Later, the audience was rewarded as Ma took center stage with accompaniment from only Pato on the piano.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of heads stood still as they fixated on Ma’s masterful playing, his eyes closed, his hand viciously sliding his bow back and forth on the cello.</p>\n<p>The Silk Road Ensemble is releasing a new album, <em>Sing Me Home,</em> on April 22.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Overnight, Tidal went from struggling to stay afloat to number one in the app store solely due to the exclusivity. #FACTS</p>\n<p>But, what’s up with the name?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last year, Mr. West began stirring the pot by releasing the album’s original name, <em>So Help Me God</em>. Shortly after, the title was changed to <em>SWISH</em>, which held strong until very recently when Kanye revealed a shift to <em>Waves</em>. The new name ignited a feud with Wiz Khalifa who believed Kanye stole the slang from imprisoned rapper Max B, curator of the term, “wavy” (publicity stunt, perhaps?). After wife Kim Kardashian conducted various Twitter polls about the three possible title choices, Kanye ultimately chose none of the above. Shocker.</p>\n<p>The meaning behind <em>The Life of Pablo</em> sparked the imaginations of many Twitter philosophers.</p>\n<p>Theories about the ever elusive “Pablo” went rampant, ranging from the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar to Pablo Picasso, arguably the most influential artist of the 20th century. The latter is more likely when taking in account the lyric, “I feel like Pablo when I’m working on my shoes” and Kanye’s self-proclaimed title as one of the greatest artists of all time.</p>\n<p>However, new rumors stated that Kanye claimed Pablo is actually a reference to St. Paul (Pablo in Spanish) which fits the gospel tunes in “Ultralight Beam,” “Father Stretch My Hands,” his son’s own name and the allusions of Mary and Joseph in the revamped version of “Wolves.”</p>\n<p>Part of the genius of TLOP lies in its hectic release. Kanye gave his fans a front row seat to the makings of an album. It went from an obscure process that magically occurred behind closed doors to a play-by-play experience filled with raw, uncut footage.</p>\n<p>Before embarking on the journey of <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, one must bring their sense of humor because first and foremost, the album is ridiculous. From its multiple name changes and ever-changing track lists, label as a “gospel album,” parade of features and cockiness every step of the way, the purposeful outrageousness is clear.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be talked about. “Everyone gonna say something … I’d be worried if they said nothing”. And what better way to get people talking than with insults? In between poking fun at Rob for his weight and sexual endeavors and reminding Ray J that it doesn’t matter who “may have hit it first,” he also managed to (accidentally?) reignite a feud with Taylor Swift. But hey, who can blame the guy? He already admitted, “I don’t know what it is with females … I’m not too good with that shit.”</p>\n<p>However, the braggadocio humor in “Famous” and “Highlights” starkly contrasts the self-reflection in “Real Friends” and “30 Hours,” which represents Kanye’s game face in social circles as compared to his inner thoughts respectively. He also uses TLOP to reinforce the juxtaposition between the profane and the sacred that has come to identify most of his work. Hence, “pray for Paris, pray for the parents” transitions to “now if I fuck this model and she just bleached her asshole …” Granted, not his best lyrically, but the duality is important here.</p>\n<p>It’s bipolar and doesn’t always make sense. Just like humanity. Kanye’s sometimes flawed, but complete honesty makes TLOP so monumental. It reveals the good, bad and the ugly in humanity.</p>\n<p>And the constant revisions that occurred up until the minute the album was released were not hints of sloppiness, but rather the strokes of creative liberty and passion. Without Chance the Rapper’s last minute prodding to keep “Waves,” already a favorite track, the album would be missing a vital organ. The transition between “I Love Kanye” to “Waves” is so flawless that it makes you wonder how the song was passed up in the first place.</p>\n<p>But yes, overall the album is disjointed.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks cohesion.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks an overarching message.</p>\n<p>However, are those really problems? Since when did cohesiveness become a staple for artistic expression? Keep in mind that TLOP is coming from an artist who has already proven he is capable of impeccable mixing and mastering. He revolutionized a genre with every album he has put out. He already made his political statements clear. He even created “so many Kanyes.” Therefore, a lack of cohesion cannot be a mere mistake. It cannot be the effect of mediocre mixing. It must be intentional. It’s life.</p>\n<p><em>The Life of Pablo </em>takes you from church to the club to the cemetery. Kanye even manages to bring Frank Ocean out from hiding for this one. It is brilliant in its unpolished realness. So, now, it’s time to just “shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/","id":6798,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6797,6796,6795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stephen’s Eclectic Sounds Take Over Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Few people watched as Tyson Leonard, the violinist and founder of the band Tropo, a man in a simple black T-shirt holding a violin, made his way onto the stage.

Although Tropo was originally a one-man band, Leonard was later accompanied by drummer Adam Kapuscinski and bassist Grant Leonard. Interestingly, their jazzy and classical rhythm is integrated with a lush synth, providing an electronic club atmosphere. As more people filled the room, a funkier and groovier tempo arose, causing the audience to start dancing, along with a soothing touch of vocals from Leonard, maintaining a relaxing rhythm. This portion of the show felt as if it was a Boiler Room session with Flume and Yo-Yo Ma. Despite the upbeat feel, Tropo lacked some of the interaction and performance expertise that was embodied by the subsequent performers.</p>\n<p>Upon gathering their various instruments, Tropo thanked Santa Barbara’s amazing crowd and made their way off stage. Throughout the intermission I overheard some conversations and managed to interact with a few of the audience members. Two young women told me their reasons for being at the show that night.</p>\n<p>“My friend and I were just looking for a place with good music and we came across this, we’ve never heard of any of these artists before,” stated one of the girls. Her friend then went on to explain, “We were just looking for good music, really, of any genre.” Although they were unfamiliar with the artists prior to the show, they both agreed that the music was surprisingly sensational.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup for the night was perfect for just that — anyone with an eclectic taste in music and a yearning for melodic jams.</p>\n<p>A skinny and tall young man approached the mic with high intensity. “Can we turn up? It’s fucking Saturday night!” yelled Lafa Taylor, the Oakland-based singer/emcee/producer. Throughout his career, Taylor has managed to find himself incorporating a variety of different genres into his music, leading to a unique artistic performance. Not only is the music that Lafa Taylor has to offer noteworthy, but he also has an impressive ability to engage the audience and leave them craving more. Taylor’s beats were so ardent that each time the bass dropped the venue shook and the crowd became invigorated and overcome by the music. “Y’all feel that shit!?” yelled the emcee. Although heavily influenced by trap, Taylor has managed to dig deep into the roots of R&amp;B and old-school hip hop, incorporating it into his setlist. People sang along as Ginuwine’s “Pony” came on and a nostalgic feeling emerged as Notorious B.I.G’s “Hypnotize” resonated through the loudspeakers, dispersing into the elated audience.</p>\n<p>Lafa Taylor’s “It’s all music” message pervaded his performance to emphasize that despite the wide genres of music exemplified, the ultimate goal was to play soulful music that would allow the audience to lose themselves in the music.</p>\n<p>After a long wait, Stephen finally took the stage, leading everyone to force their way even closer to him, ensuring a better view. Although Stephen gained much of his fanbase from the song “Bullet Train,” which he made back in 2013 while still in college. He has since transitioned into a somewhat new sound that has a much more genuine essence. Similar to a vast majority of other artists that create music without the intention to simply attain great wealth, Stephen has a relatively small fanbase. Every song was filled with a high level of intimacy due to all of Stephen’s music surprisingly being backed up by the singing of the crowd. Almost everyone in attendance sang the lyrics to every song he played, each time becoming more entranced with his words and the music. Nonetheless, this was not the only impressive element of Stephen’s performance, as he demonstrated his incredible knowledge of almost every instrument that surrounded him and as he not only sang, but also played the drums and guitar. “I’m gonna be real with you guys, that was probably the best I’ve ever played a guitar,” Stephen shared after he gave an astonishingly remarkable guitar solo. He went on to make it clear that he could, for a fact, play a rad drum solo — “Alright, before I leave I have to play the drums,” announced Stephen as he grabbed the drumsticks and had an intense drum-off with the original drummer. To finish off the show, Stephen performed a phenomenal live version of his cover of Adele’s “Hello.”</p>\n<p>The night was, in the words of Lafa Taylor himself, “A fusion of music, multiple styles mixed together!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/","id":6799,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6798,6797,6796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"STRFKR Gets Rowdy in VNTRA","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=800%2C517&ssl=1","description":"STRFKR is very serious about not being taken too seriously.

Ironically lifting their name from the label slapped onto those willfully entrenched in the celebrity lifestyle they so eschew, STRFKR’s live set perfectly crystallizes their direct dedication to keeping things fun.</p>\n<p>Fake Drugs started the show off with a set hurtling down a cyberpunk highway at 80 mph on a Tron bike. The electro-punk duo slapped some frenetic strings over new wave synths and squawked distorted, unintelligible vocals. While the Drugs maintained a high energy throughout, their show would’ve been greatly enhanced by the addition of a live drummer; without one, they lacked the rawness that an exciting punk act should exhibit. Though not all that compelling in and of itself, their synthy vibe served to whet the collective appetite for Com Truise, the second act of STRFKR’s winter tour.</p>\n<p>Com Truise seemed to appear all at once, assuming his position helming an expansive dual-Macbook mixing station. Silent and stoic and clad in a plain black tee, he spun a pulsing set of his ’80s synthwave repertoire. Com Truise and the entire stage were highlighted over by melting geometries in neon pastels, unfortunately dim as a result of presumably deficient projector settings. Enthused audience members cast crude shadow puppets on the spiraling visuals, nipping and winking innocently at the unalterable DJ. After bumping back-to-back jams like crowd favorite “VHS Sex,” Com Truise departed coolly, without a word. His music spoke loudly enough to set the perfect palette for STRFKR to paint their vibrant poppy melodies with.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the crowd shuffled with anticipation for the main event, a fog machine puffed out its haze incessantly, shrouding the stage in mystique. As STRFKR took the stage and began to play, the reason become clear; the six pillars of shifting light and color standing behind the band was allowed to play in the negative space, effusing a chameleon glow throughout the theater, perfectly timed with their upbeat rhythms.</p>\n<p>The set was constant crescendo. Despite maintaining their grooving mellow throughout, the band managed to draw out more and more crazed feedback from their audience with every song. Draped in a velvet dress that could’ve been snatched from his grandmother’s closet, frontman Joshua Hodges crooned softly as his bandmates deftly riffed through their collection of indie poptronica tunes. The four appeared a little bit mismatched on stage, to charming effect. Pointing out each member individually, UCSB second-year Johanna Ramirez noted “That one looks like he came from a Renaissance faire, that one looks like a dad, that one a college dropout and that guy a high school student that plays in a band at night.”</p>\n<p>Despite their quirky aesthetic differences, the band expertly meshed together sonically.</p>\n<p>The four of them stayed playful throughout, not afraid to shuffle up their spots on stage. Hodges and drummer Keil Corcoran traded spots for “German Love,” and bassist Shawn Glassford joined the scramble for a trio of covers, including The Human League’s “Don’t You Want Me” and New Order’s “Blue Monday.” During their famous rendition of Cyndi Lauper’s (er, Robert Hazard’s) “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” friends of the band arrived on stage decked out in spacesuits to launch confetti cannons from their groins. The rowdy astronauts also incited a spree of (excessive) crowdsurfing throughout the audience, much to the chagrin of the venue’s hyperactive security guards.</p>\n<p>After blasting through hits like “Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second,” “Malmo” and “While I’m Alive,” the band departed to clamorous roars from the audience. As a soft light hung in the foggy haze, recorded speech (presumably the words of Alan Watts, a big influence on Hodges) was drowned out by the calls of the crowd for more. The intermission stretched on, but the crowd was relentless, erupting ecstatically when the band resumed the stage to close the night out with an encore consisting of “Pop Song” and “Bury Us Alive,” culminating with a rock-star performance of “Leave It All Behind” among flaring strobes of darkness and white light. By the end of the set, Hodges lank hair stuck to his forehead, a facsimile of the turbo energy the audience channeled increasingly up to the very last song of the night. The band thanked their parents watching above in the Ventura Majestic’s closed-off balcony, and left the stage graciously to the applause of a crowd that’d just had a seriously good FKing time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/","id":6797,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6796,6795,6794],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":19,"route":"/categories/artsweek/music","highestPage":35}},"__N_SSG":true}
