Vulnerable, she stopped short after opening with “Fastlove” in her tribute to the esteemed pop icon. She asked to “restart” the song from the top saying, “I can’t mess this up for him.” She shares an emotional connection to Michael because of their mutual London roots. It was quite a night for the pop songstress herself. The powerhouse singer simply dominated, bringing home five Grammys for her third studio album, 25, in the show’s most sought-after categories: Song, Record and Album of the Year. The British songstress performed “Hello” in a geometric red and black dress with an accordion skirt, channeling her classic look with a new twist.  The nostalgia in the room was uncanny, with the singer gushing, “The last time I was here was five years ago, and I was pregnant … I lost a lot of myself being a mother … it seems like I’ve gone full circle.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout her five wins, Adele decided to share her successes with an idol of hers, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>“I adore you, and I want you to be my mommy,” she exclaimed to Queen Bey. “The Lemonade album was so monumental … We got to see another side of you … We, as artists, adore you … You are our light.” Beyoncé stopped the show with her breathtaking performance centered around her latest studio album, Lemonade. Although she chose to perform less popular tracks, including “Love Drought,” and “Sandcastles,” she successfully won over the crowd. Even while pregnant with twins, she still owned it. Bey’s royalty radiated through her goddess-like costume.</p>\n<p>The messages she instilled in us will stay: “Your mother is a woman, and women like her cannot be contained.” Queen Bey’s performance will go down in Grammys history.</p>\n<p>Although there was no specific tribute dedicated to David Bowie, he won Best Rock Song with “Blackstar,” the title track from his 25th and final studio album, which was released on his 69th birthday.</p>\n<p>Best New Artist recipient Chance the Rapper also took the night by storm.</p>\n<p>“I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” he exclaimed. “I know that people think independence means you do things by yourself, but independence means freedom.”</p>\n<p>He referenced SoundCloud and “all the independent artists out there” throughout his speech and encouraged the audience to continue in their endeavors, big or small. Chance started as an independent artist himself with his first mixtape, 10 Day, and since then, he has made significant strides in the music world, winning his first Grammy with Coloring Book. His success shows that no matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75760\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"859788678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75756\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75760\" data-attachment-id=\"75760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75760\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p>After taking a break from the public since her father’s death in 2009, Paris Jackson finally made an appearance, presenting The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The trio began with a medley of “Starboy” that led into “I Feel It Coming.” The collaboration gave rise to an unusual yet intriguing set that channeled Hoth from “Star Wars.”</p>\n<p>New York DJ duo Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, also known as the Chainsmokers, rocked the charts this past year. Tracks such as “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer” and “Roses” blasted through speakers on repeat, whether at a raging party, the gym or car radios. It’s no wonder that they won their first ever Grammy Award this year alongside Daya. Although Rihanna turned them down to be featured in the Grammy winning single, “Don’t Let Me Down,” they still seemed to reach success in the viral department.</p>\n<p>Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots were definitely not “stressed out” about receiving their award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” in nothing but their underpants.</p>\n<p>“Josh turned to me … and he said, ‘If we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this,’” Joseph said.</p>\n<p>Ed Sheeran was loving our bodies, and we are loving his Grammy performance right back. Although he was a last-minute addition to the set list, he did not disappoint. Sheeran centered his performance around his latest single, “Shape of You.” He decided to play it casual and performed the song with nothing more than his acoustic guitar. His manner seemed like he was performing for a few of his closest friends, yet millions were watching all over the world. His all-black outfit — including a “HOAX” T-shirt, black jeans and kicks — contributed to the affinity of his performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native Katy Perry took the stage with a new and improved look. With short blonde locks that frame her face and a new wardrobe, she surprised the audience as platinum Perry. She really was trapped in her “white picket fence” as she took the stage on a set emulating her opening line to her new hit single, “Chained To The Rhythm.” Perry came barreling out in a white, black-lined pantsuit and John Lennon-esque rose-colored glasses and white sneakers. She walked through blue and white clouds and turned the corner to find Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican legend Bob Marley. The younger Marley channeled his grandfather’s eclectic reggae sound and wore a white army jacket and pants. Perry topped her performance off with an iconic “We the People” backdrop.</p>\n<p>In a night with no shortage of political statements, Donald Trump was criticized by a number of performers. Neil Portnow, record producer and president of the Recording Academy, took a different approach, calling out to Washington to keep American music alive.</p>\n<p>After quoting John F. Kennedy, he remarked, “The Recording Academy together with the music-makers call on the President and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.” Portnow concluded, “We have a collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique,  economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/","id":6710,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6709,6708,6707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Six Songs About Girls: A Valentine’s Day Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2013-05-27-AmyOhAmy.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2013-05-27-AmyOhAmy.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sugar, spice and everything nice.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sugar, spice and everything nice.

This tune penned by the legendary McCartney-Lennon duo is centered around the simple phrase, “Michelle, my belle.” Not even a minute into the song, Paul McCartney is tenderly pleading with Michelle in French to understand how much he wants, needs and loves her.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrRLH-ZGZEs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Amy” by Ryan Adams</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Adams paints a picture of himself sitting by a window, wondering if Amy still loves him after countless seasons have passed.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although you may not recognize his name, Sampha is a voice you’ve likely heard before. The singer, songwriter and producer from South London has had his hands in many of the best R&amp;B, neo soul and electronic records of the past few years. He co-produced four songs on Pitchfork’s top album of 2016, Solange’s spectacular record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and lends his vocals to one of the top singles from that album, “Don’t Touch My Hair.” He’s worked heavily with British DJ and Young Turks label-mate SBTRKT. He’s been featured in tracks by Kanye, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Drake, yet hadn’t released a full debut album of his own until this week’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When a new artist like Sampha gains the respect of so many talented and influential musicians before they’ve even put out a debut album, it’s good to pay attention to their solo work ,and I’m glad I did with his new project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sampha states in the heartfelt ballad about his childhood, “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” he has “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something some people call a soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” His vocals aren’t perfect and clean, but they carry tremendous emotion. His voice is like a beautiful, passionate mixture of James Blake, Frank Ocean and Leon Bridges, and he’s already learned how to compliment it well with the instrumentation on his debut LP. On “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” one of the lead singles of the project which Sampha dedicates to his mother, he strips back the instrumentation and creates an amazing back-and-forth between himself and the piano that make you believe him when he says, “No one knows me like the piano in my mother’s home.” The listener can feel the true demand he feels for self-expression. That amount of soulfulness is special, and Sampha has it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hear that soulfulness again when he sings of the ways he blamed a past lover for his own underlying problems in “Reverse Faults,” using the metaphor of taking the breaks out of his own car, getting into an accident and blaming the other person in the relationship even though it was his own doing. You hear it when in “Timmy’s Prayer,” perhaps singing about this same ex, he laments that, “I got thrown out / I don’t know which way to go now / Don’t know which way is home now.” Not only is his vocal delivery powerful, but Sampha also does an incredible job of painting a picture with his lyrics. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His lyrical imagery is most notable on what is perhaps the best song on the album, “Blood on Me.” The most upbeat and exciting track on the record, “Blood on Me” features evocative images of a tortured dreamscape where Sampha is running away from his inner demons and fears. Throughout the track, the singer is out of breath and the repetition of the intro throughout the runtime of the song creates a dreadful, anxious chase scene in the listener’s mind. He has said in an interview with Genius that this track came about from improvising on the piano after watching the critically-acclaimed anime film</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ghost in the Shell</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the influence is obvious, as the emotion of a cold world filled with enemies around every corner really comes across in the delivery of this track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might lob the same criticisms on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that many initially did on Solange’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which Sampha worked heavily on. They might say that it’s too low-key, especially within the deeper cuts of the record. However, his style of electronic-infused soul is not as laid back as it would first seem and has a lot of depth to it that rewards multiple listens, especially once you dig deeper into lyrics. Not every single song is a complete hit, but that’s to be expected with a debut record. Still, every song on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showcases the unique artistry Sampha brings to the table. In the end, what we are left with is one of the best soul debuts of the past few years and perhaps the best album of the year so far.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/","id":6708,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6707,6706,6705],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: CULTURE by Migos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=942%2C336&ssl=1","description":"The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Atlanta’s Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, who make up the trio known as Migos, have always made music that is more than just <i>music</i>. They breathe the voice of hip hop’s most vibrant city, they craft anthems for a young and energetic generation and they drop some of the filthiest bangers on the face of this planet. Simply put, it’s more than music. It’s culture.</p>\n<p>Many Migos mixtapes and albums have come and gone, but the hip hop community, internet and culture were especially buzzing for this one. The group had been lurking in the background after the overdone and frankly overrated “Pipe It Up,”and with the dab trend having died out, many dismissed the group as superficial gimmick rappers. But everything changed in October with the single “Bad and Boujee.”</p>\n<p>“Bad and Boujee,” as Donald Glover pointed out in his Golden Globes name-check of the track, is extremely important — for Migos, hip hop and all of us. “Bad and Boujee” showed the world not only that Migos are back stronger than ever, but also that they are making much more than gimmick hits. This song is the thesis statement, manifesto and earth-shattering proclamation of <i>CULTURE</i>, the album and the construct. The infectious bounce of this hit is why the hype is so present around this album, and upon the first listen, this hype is absolutely warranted.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens up with the title track, “Culture.” Featuring DJ Khaled, this song utilizes the most appropriate hypeman possible because, whether you like him or not, Khaled has established himself as a cultural icon over the last year. The next few tracks keep the album’s opening extremely high energy, as heavy-hitting singles “T-Shirt,” “Call Casting” and “Bad and Boujee” follow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the album, which features entirely new material, is extremely consistent with strong production, smooth southern flow and a few well-placed features. Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Travis Scott, who all mesh perfectly with Migos, have standout roles. “Kelly Price,” featuring Travis Scott, particularly shows the group’s versatility as they weave in and out of a downtempo beat with melodic verses. This album’s strength lies in the ability to go in on a harder beat and contrarily sing well on a slower one. Other highlights include the head nodder “Get Right Witcha,” and a Zaytoven-produced piano banger called “Big On Big.” The contrasts between each track are noticeable and keep the listener engaged throughout the album. The only noticeable flaw is the drawn-out length of some of the songs.</p>\n<p><i>CULTURE</i> is extremely important for the careers of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, as it is the most seriously they have been taken and is the first true album from the group that will be listened to as such. After early breakout hits like the Drake-remixed “Versace” and club favorite “Hannah Montana,” Migos were all about internet presence. They made hot singles that were played for fun at parties, often memed on the internet, and nothing more. However, after signing onto Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label and this release of a cohesive and consistent album on the coattails of “Bad and Boujee,” Migos are finally serious hip hop contenders.</p>\n<p>The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. Upon listening to this album, it is extremely apparent that their approach has changed from a hit-making formula to something both enigmatic and fluid. Quavo, Offset and Takeoff have used Atlanta to create music that is not for profit appeal but for the appeal of themselves, their roots, their experience and their audience. Migos have started a dialogue with their audience that we must engage in — for ourselves, for the music, for each other, for the culture.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/","id":6707,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6706,6705,6704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Elephante Brings Dreamy Beats to the HUB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The energy was already high nearly an hour before Elephante came on, and the Hub filled up quickly for the sold-out show.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past Thursday, Los Angeles-based DJ, Elephante, mesmerized students in the Hub with electronic remixes and resounding drops.

His tracks are easy to dance to and have a similar feel to Andrew Luce, another up-and-coming DJ who played at the Hub during Fall Quarter.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75441\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"482766820\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75441\" data-attachment-id=\"75441\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/elephante-1-26-17-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elephante 1-26-17-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75441 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The night’s opener, Sarthe, played to a cozy yet growing crowd. He remixed popular songs like Twenty One Pilots’ “The Judge,” gaining many cheers from the crowd while continually shouting, “Give it up if UCSB still parties like it used to!” (And believe me, we do.) Sarthe played a continuous set, moving from one song to another quickly and smoothly through soundboard effects. He’s a loud, big personality, interacting with the crowd and encouraging everyone to “Get weird.” The energy was already high nearly an hour before Elephante came on, and the Hub filled up quickly.

Opening with the track “Closer,” featuring Bishøp, he almost immediately captured the attention of anticipating students. The upbeat mix of dance, house and mellow EDM is easy for even the most casual electronic music fans to enjoy. He kept the crowd moving all night and students sang along to whimsical lyrics. His brand of music is perfect to let sparks fly; couples danced all throughout the crowd. Elephante’s beats are a clear rebellion against the buttoned-up corporate world, celebrating the simplest moments of electric excitement. He intoxicated crowds with trippy music and the lights behind him framed his silhouette. The beat drop in “Dynasty” with MIIA elicited cheers and synchronized swaying.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

By 10:30 p.m., all you could see was the hands of dancers in front of you illuminated by colorful stage lights on a perfectly transformed dance floor, backed by a beer garden. Flanked by the bookstore and surrounded by popular on-campus restaurants, the Hub really feels like home. Watching artists perform there has an interesting appeal because of how greatly transformed it is from the bustling student center it is during the daytime. It enables UCSB music lovers to magically transform from top scholars to dancers after nightfall.</p>\n<p>A large part of Elephante’s appeal is his background, particularly how he stood up to his family and peers and went after his musical goals. Dropping out of school to pursue a career in the music industry is risky, but it’s undoubtedly paid off for him. Seeing and supporting growing artists is a great way to get exposed to new music and, in Elephante’s case, a great example of a student following their heart. Having an up-and-coming artist play in the Hub is a unique experience we as UCSB students get to experience. There is such a contagious excitement in a room full of young people pursuing their dreams and watching others succeed as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/","id":6706,"author":{"id":705,"name":"Olivia Yazzolino"},"related":[6705,6704,6703],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Atomics Are a Blast from the Past","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=948%2C362&ssl=1","description":"Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world.

Some would say the Smiths are “genetically blessed” or “musically talented”—close to having it all. I’ll say they’re definitely something else. With a mere entrance they seem like they’re from the 70s, which may stem from their early upbringing and roots in Spanish Fork, Utah, a small town one hour south of Salt Lake City.</p>\n<p>“We got instruments for Christmas when we were younger. When we first started, we lived in Utah, so we just set up all our instruments in the family room. We’ve been playing since then, but it was probably seven or eight years ago when we said, ‘Let’s form a band and play shows.’ We had our name, ‘The Atomics,’ and that was it. We’ve been doing this for a long time, but it keeps transitioning,” Daisy spilled.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Lucky on drums, Pyper on bass, Daisy on guitar and Starlie on lead vocals, these siblings are invincible.

Pyper impressed the audience with her dance moves, iconically falling to the ground with her guitar. The song, “Cuz You’re in Love,” was featured in a recent H&amp;M campaign video. It’s slow sound and wave-like beat transformed the audience from jumping up and down to a nonchalant sway. The Smiths closed their set with their latest song, “Voulez Vous,” which was released in October and is available for listening on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world. All four are signed with Next Models, Los Angeles. Pyper discussed balancing music with modeling, “Well, I can’t choose between the two because they’re so different, even though they’re both in the entertainment industry. Like with music I’m a bit more free, I play what I want and dress how I want,” she said. “With modeling, everyone’s doing what they want to me and I’m trying to create an image for them. Scheduling wise it’s good because modeling is during the day. There’s set times and our photo shoots are usually in the morning, so I can always do music at night. It’s fun to do both.”</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Voulez Vous by THE ATOMICS\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286907145&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The amazing thing about this family band is how eclectic and original their sound is, yet it’s retro psychedelic. “When we first started playing together we played surf music, so we did a lot of Ventures covers,” Daisy added. “Our influences differ a lot depending on which band member you’re talking to. Like I play guitar, so I love like Dick Dale and Chuck Berry. Lucky loves old school hip-hop beats, while Pyper loves disco music and Starlie loves jazz and soulful singers.”</p>\n<p>With so much to juggle as band mates, modeling partners and siblings, the Smiths’ still get the job done. They’ve successfully assimilated into the Californian rock’n’roll lifestyle, all while walking runways such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Bottega Veneta, Fendi and Tom Ford.</p>\n<p>“In the next year we’ll be playing Coachella. We’re going to be in Europe doing shows, so I think it’s going to be a lot of traveling, which is always fun with my siblings,” Pyper said, reflecting on what’s to come in the next few months. “I hope that we can develop our music more because a lot of our songs are different. I hope that we can focus in on a sound we all really love and become tighter as a band.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75421\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75421\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/","id":6704,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6703,6702,6701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Switchfoot and Relient K Rock the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=900%2C529&ssl=1","description":"Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday evening, alternative rock bands Relient K and Switchfoot performed at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara as a part of the “Looking for America Tour Part II.” Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike. Both bands had plenty of these to perform, as they’ve been active since the late ’90s, and each released an album earlier this year. Switchfoot’s July 2016 album, <em>Where the Light Shines Through</em>, provided the tour’s name with one of its tracks, “Looking for America.” Relient K’s eighth album, <em>Air for Free</em>, was released later that month.</p>\n<p>The show began with Relient K taking the stage, designed to resemble the yard of a quaint cabin in the woods, complete with a white buffalo and a strip of artificial turf. This scene was characteristic of the band, who are “quirky, super-relatable … not-typical rock stars,” as attendee Chad Jordan described. As soon as the band took the stage, they launched into the opening strums of their hit song, “High of 75.” This beginning, met with emphatic applause, preceded upbeat songs such as “Who I Am Hates Who I’ve Been,” “Be My Escape” and “Sadie Hawkins Dance.”</p>\n<p>The music was interspersed with introductions and light-hearted stories from lead singer Matt Thiessen. In a particular moment of nostalgia, he mentioned that during a past tour stop, he purchased 30 shirts at a now-defunct Santa Barbara clothing store. Later in the set, Thiessen noted his band and Switchfoot’s partnership with a charity organization called CURE International, which provides surgeries for conditions such as cleft palates to children who would not ordinarily be able to receive them. Thiessen encouraged the audience to visit the organization’s booth outside, also mentioning to the audience that the first leg of the tour resulted in over 100 surgeries for children.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Relient K concluded their set with their 11-minute song, “Deathbed,” from their fifth album, <em>Five Score and Seven Years Ago</em>. The album version of the song features Jon Foreman, the lead singer of Switchfoot, at the very end, so many fans of the groups undoubtedly hoped he would come on stage to sing his part. Sure enough, when the song neared his cue, the singer came out, embracing Thiessen as he played the piano, then advanced to the microphone to sing. It yielded a very powerful end to Relient K’s portion of the concert.</p>\n<p>Once Relient K’s cabin background and décor was replaced by various monitors, the stage was set for Switchfoot. Each member of the group, save Jon Foreman, came to the stage, with Foreman’s silhouette depicted on a monitor. Foreman began to sing “Holy Water,” and soon made his welcome arrival on stage. The group followed this with one of its earlier hits, “Meant to Live,” shortly after which Foreman wasted no time interacting with the audience. After beginning “Bull in a China Shop,” the lead singer climbed down from the stage and into the audience, balancing on the theatre seats with support from enthusiastic attendees and went back about five rows into the audience before returning to the stage. Foreman made his way into the audience later in the concert as well, creating a very personal experience, especially for those seated near the front.</p>\n<p>After playing a fair amount of more recent songs, especially those from their most recent album, the band played one of their earliest hits and a powerful ballad, “Only Hope.” Toward the beginning of the tune, Foreman urged the audience to turn on their cell phones’ flashlights and sway them with the music, following that up with a request for the stage lights to be shut off. The result was a theater solely illuminated by the spectacle of the tilting lights. The song itself possessed a certain impact as well; attendee and physical therapist Taisa Skovorodkl said she “totally fangirled out on ‘Only Hope,’ cause it was like memories of high school all over again.”</p>\n<p>After several more songs, Thiessen and Relient K’s drummer, Dave Douglas, returned to the stage to contribute vocals, then left Switchfoot to give a proper end to the concert with their most popular hit, “Dare You To Move.” The song was prefaced with Foreman relating that he first sung it shortly after dropping out of college, and that no matter where you are, you don’t know what tomorrow may hold.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/","id":6705,"author":{"id":704,"name":"Isaac Mikulski"},"related":[6704,6703,6702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tracks of the Month: January 2017","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At the end of each calendar month, Artsweek takes a look at new tracks that stood out and made a place in our playlists.

The xx first burst onto the scene with their critically acclaimed 2009 debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">xx</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After the success of their debut, the band followed up with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coexist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2012. These albums both showcased the group’s minimalist approach to pop and dance music engineered by DJ Jamie Smith. Smith’s 2015 solo debut album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Colour</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — released under the stage name Jamie xx — was one of the best records of that year and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album. The album featured contributions from xx guitarist/vocalist Romy Croft and bassist/vocalist Oliver Sim, and its subsequent success makes the band’s debut all the more intriguing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For fans of the xx’s previous work, this album keeps their atmospheric instrumentation and their oft-touched themes of love and loneliness. However, the addition of samples influenced Smith’s solo work and brought more dynamism to the tracks. Croft and Sim’s vocals might not be the showiest, but they both do a great job breathing emotion into these tracks. In what is perhaps the best song on the album, “Say Something Loving,” there is a great sample from the Alessi Brothers’ 1976 tune, “Do You Feel It?” that perfectly compliments Sim and Croft as they sing about a new love and the doubt that it might “slip away.” On a previous project, the band would never use such an obvious vocal sample, but it works quite well here and the song is better for it. Another standout track is the lead single “On Hold,” which again features a prominent vocal sample, this time from the Hall &amp; Oates song, “I Can’t Go For That (No Can Do).” This is a definite new direction for the band, but it is really a melding of the solo work of Smith and the previous sound of the xx that keeps their style cohesive. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the additions of vocal samples to a few of the tracks, there are still standouts that have no samples and epitomize the group’s sound, such as “Performance,” in which Croft sings about the pressure she feels to act a certain way and to perform to impress rather than be herself. Here, Smith does a great job complimenting the vocals by letting them take center stage, while the strings in the background build the emotional tension. This sort of track is exactly what a fan of the band would expect, and the group pulls it off beautifully. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I See You </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has all the normal ingredients the xx’s records offer, from Smith’s carefully constructed beats to the duality of the two lead singers going back and forth with their trademark emotional, low-key vocals. For fans of Jamie Smith’s solo work, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I See You </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might not be quite what they are looking for, but it’s certainly worth a listen.  Smith’s solo work is characterized by his ingenious use of samples and his ability to create a variety of different emotions in a beat. While some may contend that the presence of Croft and Sim makes this album more restrained than Smith’s dynamic 2015 release, it is unfair to compare his solo work  to that of the larger band. Smith and the xx embody different genres, therefore intentionally have different sounds. Instead of comparison, appreciate how the group has evolved to incorporate their previous work and the sound of Jamie xx’s solo work to create something even more exciting. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/the-friday-review-the-xx-i-see-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/the-friday-review-the-xx-i-see-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/the-friday-review-the-xx-i-see-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/the-friday-review-the-xx-i-see-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/the-friday-review-the-xx-i-see-you/","id":6789,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6788,6787,6786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dawes, Dad Rock and the Modern Meaning of Genre","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genres are, in fact, boxes; they’re compartmentalized for conveniently choosing what we want to consume in a culture constantly flooded with new music.

I saw small, disposable wine cups in almost every hand that was waiting patiently for the show to start. The intimate venue was warm and ready for the Saturday night show, simply christened “An Evening with Dawes<em>.</em>”</p>\n<p>Once the house lights went dim, Dawes walked onto the stage with an energy that was stadium-ready, silhouetted by a variety of multi-chromatic backdrops. Once the band was visible, it was clear that they were greeting the stage with comfort. Lead singer Taylor Goldsmith went right into “One of Us,” from their fifth album, <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>. A week before the show, I had the chance to talk with drummer Griffin Goldsmith, younger brother of Taylor. Of the sharp album title, he said simply, “that general concept is applicable to anybody, anywhere.” And, as I watched the band play, I knew that was their intention: to be music for anybody, anywhere. Their brand of guitar music is quite refreshing in its sincere, unpretentious nature.</p>\n<p>A large theme in the music of Dawes, especially on their most recent effort, is acceptance. When asked of the things that he has had to accept recently, Griffin offered, “it’s nothing like ‘fuck Trump,’ it’s more just about experiences with aging, or things like that.” This, combined with the virtual absence of electronic elements in most of their catalogue, gives them an appeal to a more mature audience. Informally described as “dad rock,” some other familiar, and successful, acts that have this sound are Wilco, Ryan Adams and The National. The concertgoers that I noticed flooding the lobby of the venue and standing in lines to buy merchandise were not young and were mostly male.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Any genre prefaced by the word “dad” is bound to ruffle feathers, but the label doesn’t offend Dawes. “That’s not the most encouraging genre,” Griffin laughed. “But, I mean, that kind of stuff doesn’t offend me. I feel like all it does is allow people to categorize us, in a sense.” He then considered the genres that are generally accepted, and commonly used to describe Dawes’ sound. “We often get ‘Americana’ or ‘Laurel Canyon sound.’ I do the same thing with music I like,” he considered. “It’s fine; to put it in a box means that you like it.”</p>\n<p>Genres are, in fact, boxes; they’re compartmentalized for conveniently choosing what we want to consume in a culture constantly flooded with new music. However, some music is best created by challenging these very categories, and Dawes knows that is where the opportunity for growth lay while writing <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>. “I think the songs made it very clear to us that this wasn’t going to be a folk record. We felt like these songs could benefit from a different approach,” Griffin explained. One of the songs, “When the Tequila Runs Out,” explores the dynamic between the familiarity of the band’s typically delicate approach to music and the heavier sound that runs throughout their new songs. The crowd raised their plastic glasses to the chorus and danced in the space between their seats and the carpeted aisles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74968\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"88473201\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74966\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74968\" data-attachment-id=\"74968\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/dawes-dad-rock-and-the-modern-meaning-of-genre/dawes-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=2048%2C1583&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1583\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dawes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=888%2C687&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74968 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes-250x193.jpg?resize=250%2C193\" alt=\"Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=768%2C594&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=1024%2C792&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=430%2C330&amp;ssl=1 430w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74968\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Throughout both hour-long portions of the show, Dawes scattered quiet moments from earlier in their catalogue. “Now That It’s Too Late, Maria” was a particularly charming moment in the set list, with the harmonies of the Goldsmith brothers highlighting the folk ballad’s lovelorn lyrics. The brothers’ chemistry in conjunction with their other bandmates is smooth. The pounding, Fleetwood Mac-like rhythms of bassist Wylie Gelber keep the band grounded, while flourishes added by keyboardist Lee Pardini give the songs a much appreciated lightness.</p>\n<p>Dawes’ world-wise, well-traveled lyrics are built around metaphors that fill the music with warmth. A track that is a personal favorite of mine, “Time Spent in Los Angeles,” is a folk-rock gem bordering on country, about a girl who has “a special kind of sadness” because of the city that she’s spent her years in. In fact, to record their newest album, the quartet returned to Los Angeles, their hometown. The band has spent a considerable amount of time in other locales, recording albums in North Carolina and Tennessee. Their homecoming to the West Coast metropolis is perhaps what allowed for a cooler sounding record. The existential chill of “We’re All Gonna Die” filled the room with what felt like a rush of air, in comparison to the acoustic tenderness that characterizes songs like “Time Spent.”</p>\n<p>After a show that ran well over two hours, the band left the stage, only to return again for an encore. When they walked back onto the stage, they humbly received the applause that swelled below them. Earlier in the show, frontman Taylor Goldsmith mentioned that the band played the Lobero in 2013, filling only half of the room. Upon their return this year, they were playing a sold out show. Recording a total of five full-lengths in seven years and touring behind powerhouses such as Mumford and Sons, and legends such as Bob Dylan, Dawes’ work ethic is impeccable. <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>, and the solo, multi-city tour behind it, did not push the band in a new direction, but, in fact, many different directions. Brash guitar jams, cool synth-rock and, of course, warm acoustic-folk can be found in bits and pieces throughout the album. The categories that we put artists in can, of course, stifle them. But when music transcends categories despite, or in spite, of genres, is when the best art is made.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

And, as with any particularly tumultuous time, it left us with some amazing music. In this special end-of-year list, the Artsweek staff reflects on some of our favorites. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Emotion: Side B</i></b><b> by Carly Rae Jepsen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “Call Me Maybe” singer shifted from guilty pleasure pop anthems to complex stories disguised in ’80s pop arrangements. Jepsen channels the complexities of a love-struck mind into song, creating a colorful haven that is welcoming to all. Although these are unused songs from Jepsen’s 2015 project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these B-sides highlight a sincerity in modern pop music that is often diluted, or even completely lost. With the guidance of indie-heavy hitters Dev Hynes and Greg Kurstin, Jepsen made a project full of melancholic songs that could instantly become the soundtrack to the next independent coming-of-age film. The track “Cry” accentuates the downfalls of unrequited love with inviting synths, no doubt an influence from Hynes. The disco pulse radiating from the ’80s in “Body Language” had people singing the chorus in the shower in a matter of time. There is no need to put your Spotify on a private session when listening to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion: Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; this is an album that no one should feel guilty about listening to. Jepsen deserves more recognition for her ability to transform from one-hit wonder status to the same realm as imaginative indie-pop artists like Sky Ferreira. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Rodriguez</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service </i></b><b>by A Tribe Called Quest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legendary jazz-rap maestros A Tribe Called Quest reunite for their swan song with their first album in 18 years, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The group’s sound has aged like a fine wine, and their influence is all over the modern rap game, which is full of jazzy beats and lyrics that celebrate blackness. The group even acknowledges this on the song “Dis Generation” which passes the torch from the old guard to the new vanguard of hip-hop music shouting out “Joey, Earl, Kendrick and Cole.” Another example of the group’s sound being perfect for 2016 is the politically charged lead single, “We The People….” With divisions between people being a huge part of the rhetoric of the last election season, this track fights back emphatically. The chorus, for example, rails against the rhetoric of people like Donald Trump who believe that black, Mexican, Muslim and gay people are “bad folks” who “must go.” A Tribe Called Quest instead sells a message of unity with the track from the opening lyric, “We don’t believe you ’cause we the people,” by drawing on the language of our constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the standout tracks, it’s impossible to talk about the album without mentioning the recent passing of founding member Phife Dawg in March. The group does an amazing job celebrating the life of The Five-Footer throughout the album by incorporating Phife’s raps recorded before his death and the emotionally charged tribute, “Lost Somebody.” As Tribe calls it quits with their final album, don’t feel that you’ve lost a great rap group; instead, celebrate that they went out with a banger. As for Phife Dawg, “he’s in sunshine.”</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Splendor &amp; Misery </i></b><b>by clipping</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experimental, noise-rap trio led by 2016 Tony Award winner and frontman Daveed Diggs is back with one of the strangest releases of the year. According to their label, Sub Pop, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Splendor &amp; Misery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Afrofuturist, dystopian concept album that follows the sole survivor of a slave uprising on an interstellar cargo ship and the onboard computer that falls in love with him. If that doesn’t sound like a unique album, then I don’t know what does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thematically, clipping analyzes blackness in the modern age by catapulting it into the future and the past at the same time. The protagonist, the slave from the future Cargo 2311, comforts himself by rapping over the clangs and buzzes of the spaceship itself, and this is reflected beautifully by William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes’s instrumentation that transport the listener to the noisy ship perfectly. The album makes many allusions to the past through choral renditions of African-American slave spirituals and tackles universal themes of loneliness and existentialism as the main character suffers anxiety and depression as a result of constantly feeling on-the-run. These futuristic ideas have a basis in our modern age, but the Cargo 2331 passenger comforts himself by reasserting his roots through rap music and slave spirituals. This is reflected in today’s America, where black artists are reasserting their identity through their music in an environment that can feel hopeless with systemic injustices. </span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Blackstar</i></b><b> by David Bowie</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Bowie did something amazing with his final album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of course, it is his last album because he sadly passed away in January. However, what is truly remarkable about Bowie as an artist is that he used the pain of the cancer he eventually succumbed to and awareness of his own mortality to make his art. With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he solidifies his nearly 50-year legacy as one of the most unique artists of the last century. Not only is the subject matter innovative and unique as Bowie explores his own death, but it’s a testament to Bowie’s constant evolution as an artist that this album sounds very distinct from his previous work. He fully embraces jazz experimentalism with this album, despite being a rock legend. Additionally, with Bowie being older, he has adapted his music to highlight his weathered voice by focusing on the timbre of his vocals and the haunting mood that they create throughout the album. Overall, this album was a legendary send-off for a legendary man and artist. As Bowie tells his fans and loved ones on the song, “Dollar Days,” “Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you.” And we won’t forget you either. Rest in peace, Starman.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Blonde </i></b><b>by Frank Ocean</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most anticipated album of the year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the follow-up to Ocean’s acclaimed 2012 debut into alternative R&amp;B stardom, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">channel ORANGE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On this album, Ocean continues doing what we love him for: being himself. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features Ocean bearing his heart and soul on his sleeve as he sings about unrequited love, depression and other events from his life. The project features some of the most emotionally charged vocals and lyrics of the year as Ocean’s raw humanity shines through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the intensity of emotion and imagery throughout the album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is rather minimal. So minimal, you might not notice that Beyoncé, perhaps the most well-known modern pop artist, sings background vocals on “Pink + White” or any of the other understated features including sad Swedish rapper Yung Lean on “Self Control.” And that’s without mentioning the myriad of other artists on the album including James Blake and Pharrell Williams. This style allows Ocean’s voice to take center stage without wasting any energy on superfluous instrumentation. However, there is one feature that stands out above the rest: André 3000 on “Solo (Reprise).” André 3000 brought so much energy in his one-minute-long feature that people are begging him for a new album. This is for good reason, as “Solo (Reprise)” was, in this writer’s opinion, the best guest feature of 2016. This moment of intensity does well to inject energy into the album while keeping the focus on Ocean’s minimal style that pervades the other tracks. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have taken a while to finally come out, but any Frank Ocean fan will tell you that the wait was worth it, as he released one of the best records of the year.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>ROCKISDEAD</i></b><b> by Dorothy</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may have named their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in 35 minutes the members of Dorothy prove that rock remains alive and thriving. Old school without feeling overdone, the quartet’s debut record comes packed with infectious clapping beats, blues-inspired guitar riffs and even hints of country all centered around lead singer Dorothy Martin’s powerhouse vocals. Even if you can’t quite belt with the same ferocity as Martin, it’s hard to resist singing along with her hooks. So go ahead and put on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next time you’re on a drive; wail your heart out about what a wild and reckless rock star you are. </span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Teens Of Denial</i></b><b> by Car Seat Headrest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirteen albums in, Will Toledo and the rest of Car Seat Headrest show no signs of winding down. In fact, with their latest release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they’ve only picked up speed, so buckle up and take a listen. Appearing on multiple music publications’ best-of-2016 lists, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeds in its ability to make you feel okay with not being okay. The record offers an honest take on often-heavy topics including clinical depression, but the music never strays into cynicism, maintaining positive and hopeful sounds throughout. If you’re looking for a feel-good take on the low points in life or even just some catchy lo-fi rock tunes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is waiting for you.</span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>City Club </i></b><b>by The Growlers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of the twisted beach carnival vibe created in The Growlers’ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot Tropics, City Club</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels more like watching a five-piece downtown Vegas casino house band while peaking on acid, Raoul Duke style. In lieu of Sinatra covers, they’re playing “I’ll Be Around,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s a little confusing, but there’s nothing wrong with being disoriented sometimes. That is what is so special about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to me. While 2016 has been a time of questionable changes and uncertainty, The Growlers keep it fresh while staying true to their roots. It’s fun, romantic, weird and different from anything else out there. The Growlers are a comforting reminder that all hope isn’t lost. In a genre that has become increasingly derivative, no one else can even do a quality job at ripping them off. With the aptly titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Growlers move away from the surf rock stylings that made up the bulk of their work. Tunes like “Beach Rats” and “Burden of the Captain,” which previously defined their style now morph into “Night Ride” and “Rubber and Bone.” This transition hasn’t happened all at once and doesn’t isolate die-hard Beach Goth festival fans. It’s a diversification of The Growlers, and it’s rad.</span></p>\n<p>— Sean Edwards</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>A Moon Shaped Pool </i></b><b>by Radiohead</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English alternative lords Radiohead released their ninth studio album in 2016, and it was a gentle reminder that they are still relevant and ever-powerful influencers of music culture. Entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the album is an ethereal blend of soft droning melodies and piercing lyrics that evoke such profound emotion from mundane words. Thom Yorke has always had a unique ability to speak simply but wholly capture exactly what you’re feeling. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does this just as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK Computer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bends, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and worms its way into your mind. It relates itself to everything that’s been swirling around your brain, getting deeper with every play. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels like classic Radiohead: a little inaccessible, but that’s the point. There isn’t a Radiohead album that is immediately easily digestible; they all require active thought to really enjoy. Just like jogging through a museum, a half-assed listen may leave you confused and a little sweaty. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reveals something new or makes you feel something different with every listen. It becomes a distorted reflection of internal processes, and Yorke’s blunt lyrics still leave room for creation of your own context. Radiohead once again slipped under our skin and delivered 11 tracks to make us think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Sean Edwards</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Malibu</i></b><b> by Anderson .Paak</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop fans have been waiting for Anderson .Paak for a long time. For years, we have been left struggling to prove the true musicality and talent required to excel in our beloved art form. We could point to Kendrick Lamar for his lyrical wizardry, or Dr. Dre and his command of modern technology in production, but there was no one with undeniable musical greatness. With the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the live shows that followed, Anderson .Paak has changed all of that. A Grammy nominated album recorded on an old laptop and dented microphone, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> features a mix of soulful singing and rapping over instrument-based beats with samples from the likes Hiatus Kaiyote or fully original tunes curated by .Paak and his longtime band, The Free Nationals. Additionally, .Paak is completely redefining the standard of hip-hop live shows. While many rappers only feature a hypeman and a DJ, .Paak’s live show is music being played almost entirely live. Paak himself brings an unmatched energy with his bold personality, quirky outfits and astounding drumming capabilities (these aren’t Bieber drum fills, they’re jazz fills!). At the end of 2016, .Paak, The Free Nationals and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have brought some much-needed funk and soul pizazz to hip hop all the while raising the bar for what it means to be a performer.</span></p>\n<p>— Daniel Carroll</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Cardinal</i></b><b> by Pinegrove</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The natural inclination of people in their late teens and early twenties is to be apathetic. Whether it’s a dead-end job, rough times in school or even a hangover, there will always be a mild feeling of dislike within close reach. Pinegrove, folk-punk’s latest prodigy, captures this feeling with both wit and self-awareness on their debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardinal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “How come every outcome is such a comedown?” lead singer Evan Stephens Hall sings in a tone both sardonic and earnest on the lead track “New Friends.” The exact genre of Pinegrove’s music is hard to pinpoint, dipping into the sensibilities of modern pop-punk, toying with elements of folk and even hinting at a country twang. Music’s current state is one that has no boundaries, and this is a band that is aware of the greatness this can bring. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p>\n<p><b><i>Holy Ghost</i></b><b> by Modern Baseball</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Split between lead singers Brendan Lukens and Jake Ewald, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an 11-track confrontation of depression, loss and past loves. If you listen to the album on shuffle, the two frontmen act as a foil to one another. Ewald’s side is bold, while Lukens’ side is dark. Ewald grew up in a religious household, so tinges of those memories appear in his lyrics at times, most apparent in his wry mention of a girl who is “sipping from that holy cup.” Lukens’ mental health battles are approached directly, “always looking back on my mistakes and others’,” he sings at one point. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the band’s third album, and their growth is clear in the way they continuously dig deeper into themselves without over-exploiting their own struggles. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/","id":6784,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6783,6782,6781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Get Groovy with Marc E.

Bassy utilizes this hurt to fuel his art. Several of us will be experiencing a different kind of pain as we endure finals week, which is why seeing Marc E. Bassy when he hits Velvet Jones next Wednesday will be the perfect remedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in the Bay Area yet residing in Los Angeles, Marc E. Bassy is no stranger to the artistic scene that defines the West Coast. After working with artists like G-Eazy, Chris Brown, Wiz Khalifa and Kehlani, one might think that he would already be a household name. Instead, his inimitable talent is masked by our perception of what genre(s) music should be categorized into. However, it has yet to alter the outcome of the electric melodies he continues to make.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc E.

If you’re one of those people that had a mutual breakup and are still getting along well with your ex, you can take comfort in the fact that things could be a lot worse for you. It’s bad enough getting broken up to face to face, but hearing about your partner cheating on you from someone else is infinitely worse. I hope you aren’t in the same situation legendary soul singer Marvin Gaye croons about in this tune, but at least when your roommates hear you blasting this song, they will know how horrible your ex was. And, they’ll probably take it easy on you if you don’t help out around the apartment for a few days.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPnZZTVp_2A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”  by Hank Williams</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the John Green quote goes, pain “demands to be felt.” Hank Williams actually wrote this song when he was having relationship troubles with his first wife, so you can tell he must’ve been in a tough place. So when your pain demands to be felt, just sing, “As I wonder where you are, I’m so lonesome I could cry,” as you actually do cry into the half-eaten pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WXYjm74WFI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Self Control” by Frank Ocean</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This standout track from Ocean’s stellar 2016 release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was written about a relationship that ended. In a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feature, he says about the relationship, “We just couldn’t really relate. We weren’t really on the same wavelength.” This song has beautiful metaphors that anyone struggling in the aftermath of the Turkey Drop can relate to. As you reflect on what could’ve been, “sometimes you’ll miss it, and the sound will make you cry,” and that’s okay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. “Roses” by OutKast and “Fuck You” by Ceelo Green</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay enough with the sad stuff! Not every good breakup song is sad! These catchy songs from Atlanta-based artists will help with that third stage of grief known as anger. “Roses” is all about how André 3000’s ex, Caroline, was not as good as she thought she was, and I have a feeling Big Boi and André 3000 got their frustrations out in the expletive-filled outro. If that wasn’t enough, there’s also the second song in this pair, “Fuck You.” Not only is this song a great breakup song, it’s also catchy as hell and will probably get you dancing enough to forget that you were sad in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWju37TZfo0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pc0mxOXbWIU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. “Flesh Without Blood” by Grimes</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amazing Canadian singer-songwriter delivers this track off of her amazing 2015 release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Art Angels</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This catchy and fun song explores a different side of breakups: not caring anymore. A fact about the track is that while it’s a great song about breakups, Grimes has said that her inspiration was about a falling out between friends, which can be just as painful as a falling out between romantic partners.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv9YoYCKNoE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. “Eventually” by Tame Impala</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is another side to the Turkey Drop: Feeling a lot of mixed emotions. This song by Australian psychedelic-genius Kevin Parker and crew is only one song from an entire concept album about the singer’s breakup with his longtime girlfriend. Take comfort in Parker’s words, “I know I’ll be happier, and I know you will, too, eventually,” because with luck and holiday leftovers, both you and your ex will be.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHe8kKO8uds?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor and “Make Your Own Kind of Music” by Mama Cass</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tracks are perfect for when you’ve finally accepted your breakup and are ready to move forward. Of course, no great list of breakup songs could exclude “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor. This iconic track is practically an anthem for the dumped masses of the world. The other track is less known, but no less powerful and possibly one of this writer’s favorite songs ever. Here, Mama Cass sings the 1969 pop version equivalent of “do you, boo boo,” and it’s amazing. At the end of the day, “there’s only one song worth singing,” and that’s your song. One day you’ll sing the lyrics to these classics and mean it and know that you’re ready to move on.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBR2G-iI3-I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbSM02_1k34?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” by The Velvet Undergound</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now that you’ve gotten through the worst of it and your friends are getting pretty annoyed with your drama, you can start looking toward the future. You may be pretty jaded after your experience with the Turkey Drop, but it’s important to remember that there’s someone out there who will recognize all the amazing things about you. This track is one of the greatest love songs ever written, because when you find someone who reflects, “the beauty you are,” you’ll realize that all the struggles of your Thanksgiving heartbreak were worth it in the end.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

While we are fixated on the idea of genres, true artists separate themselves from musicians in the way that their crafts break the rules outlined for a variety of musical barriers. This is something that young minds like that of 21 Savage has accomplished, crowning him with the label of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the world of hip-hop, we have been faced with an inexhaustible amount of “SoundCloud rappers” that make it difficult to distinguish what it is that sets true hip-hop artists apart from their kind. 21 Savage makes the distinction apparent in the way that he is able to flow in and out of this new wave of music by making songs that people enjoy, but not forgetting to stay true to his sound. He has made his mark in such a way that when a person hears something of his, they can easily say, “Yeah, this definitely a 21 Savage song,” or, “I bet 21 is on this track,” without having to check. It is a tough phenomenon to explain, but is incredibly apparent after both listening to his music and watching him take the stage. Lucky for Santa Barbarans, they will have the opportunity to experience 21 Savage’s infectious wave this Thursday at Velvet Jones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Atlanta  native is best known for his work with producer Metro Boomin along with his recent release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savage Mode</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rising up in the rap scene without a label or promo team is not unheard of but can prove to make things more difficult when it comes to reaching listeners. This did not discourage 21 Savage but, rather, it pushed him to put more effort into his craft.

But, it will be easy for the entire audience to understand why this night has the potential to be one his best performances. He has shared larger stages with people like Young Thug, but it is the fact that we are able to see him solo and before he reaches his peak that makes this night special. 21 Savage is young, charismatic and will not filter himself for anyone. If you did not think he was a big deal, he will have you rethinking that by the end of his show.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/","id":6759,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6758,6757,6756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Neko Case Enchants Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-4.06.21-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-4.06.21-PM.png?resize=668%2C365&ssl=1","description":"There was something pure of the way Case poured her heart into her own words, making them echo against the walls of Campbell hall with intention.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Campbell hall filled with attendees, anticipation for Neko Case grew at the sight of the dim purple lights and the array of instruments on stage including everything from drums and guitars to keyboards and cellos. The audience, which was comprised by a majority of older adults and a few UCSB students, filled nearly every seat last Friday night at the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the main performance, musicians Erica Bachmann and Jon Raunhouse set the tone of the evening with their quirky two-man folk performance. While the two are usually on scene as backup to Neko Case, it was a refreshing surprise for their sound to open as the forefront of the show. The night was kept at a casual pace set from the beginning</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they progressed through their set, songs seemed to tell a story or paint a picture to illustrate the mood in addition to feeling it. The ruminative quality of their sound was able to carry a brief escape from the trials and tribulations of reality. Scenes of an autumn day came to pass in songs like “Lilliwaup,” while “Asthmatic Gypsy” illustrated what a waltz in Paris may feel like; it was as if the audience was transported to the particular place in time being told. Lyrics in most of the performance were not necessary as the latitude of instruments effortlessly shifting from song to song by the artful and talented minds of the light-hearted artists was more than enough. My personal favorite, “Lupe’s Lament,” effectively showcased their repertoire of tunes that were both engaging and thoughtful.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Neko Case was introduced, the audience fell to an unnerving silence awaiting her start. Both Bauchmann and Raunhouse accompanied her on the stage, set to be her backing band among two other members of the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singer-songwriter stole her audience’s breath with captivating instrumentals and lyrics, overwhelming the crowd with an array of feelings. The sweet, humorous singer opened with “The Pharaohs,” and proceeded to wow every single individual in the theater.  Neko Case can really sing. Her albums </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Worse Things get the Harder I Fight </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Middle Cyclone </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t do her voice as much justice as her live performance. The force of her words came from somewhere deep within her lungs and erupted in pitches that can only be described as a hurricane of force that still holds true to its graceful magic. I didn’t know it was possible for one voice to make a whole crowd feel connected in a range of emotions: from wholesome happiness to nostalgic sadness, all within its pitch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was love, there was sadness, there was an eeriness that brought about a haunting warmth. The humble artist not only charmed us with the highest and highs and lowest of lows, but let her own feelings guide her performance. It was obvious through her facial and body expressions, Case felt her songs on a deeper level as she sang them, showing that even the most talented are only human. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74462\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1690675448\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74461\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74462\" data-attachment-id=\"74462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-28/neko-case-enchants-campbell-hall/3531-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"306,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"3531-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74462\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of UCSB Arts and Lectures\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of UCSB Arts and Lectures</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poetic lyrics such as “Brave to the waves of its residue/ Its laughter from a marbled room/ The white-crowned sounds of possible/ The sound that lures me/ It says, ‘Don’t you hurry/ Don’t you worry, kid,’ we’ll be seeing you/ We’ll see you when you’re ready” from “Ragtime” filled every space of the theater with powerful sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience was enthralled throughout; their content disposition was most evident in the soft whispering of lyrics to songs such as “This Tornado Loves You,” and an array of smiles, myself included, couldn’t be helped. The songwriter’s most popular song “I Wish I Was the Moon” stole the show, as many started applauding at the recognition of chords from the start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was something pure of the way Case poured her heart into her own words, making them echo against the walls of Campbell hall with intention. The country-folk-rock song writer appearing in casual, bare-faced winter attire looking ready to curl up next to a fire rather than perform. But this is a part of what makes Case so special. Her passion toward her music paired with an uncaring attitude to how she represents herself is exactly what draws the audience in closer, literally. Dramatic pauses followed by explosions in songs like “Bracing for Sunday” and “Look for Me (I’ll Be Around)” had her crowd on the edges of their seats, as the ringing of the last note hung in the air and the suspense of the next one to follow built up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between sets, conversation was kept to a minimum, but mentions of 2016 being a dark year led to a change in the pace with what Case calls her “most joyful song.” “Man,” the last song of her set, ended on a bright note that brought liveliness to the stage. Its freeing feel with sounds originating back to her older work graciously stole away the reality of now.
