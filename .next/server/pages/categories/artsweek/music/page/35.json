Program Board. Originally from Syosset, New York, Blau grew up in an artistic family and learned how to play piano and guitar, as well as sing, at a young age. At the age of thirteen, his family made the move to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he is now based. On a trip to Sweden in 2011 he discovered electronic dance music.  Shortly afterwards, he began uploading his mixes and mashups to YouTube under the professional name 3LAU.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of students gathered at Storke Plaza awaiting 3LAU, but before the main star of night appeared, there was an opening performance by up-and-coming DJ Beni Haze. He was met with mostly good reception from the crowd, although some in the crowd complained of his abrupt change in songs. He played hits like “Knock You Out” by Bingo Players and “#Selfie” by The Chainsmokers — while he took a selfie. People were crowd surfing and one unfortunate girl was almost dropped. He also took the opportunity to introduce a new track to the crowd. Towards the end of his performance the crowd began to soar as more and more students filled Storke Plaza.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After much anticipation, 3LAU hit the stage and the crowd met him with pent-up enthusiasm. As a result, a wave formulated from concert-goers pushing back and forth in the crowd, which resulted in people being knocked down (including myself) and security having to pull people out from the front near the stage because they were being pushed up against the fence.</p>\n<p>Before beginning his performance, 3LAU spoke to the crowd, saying that one of his good friends had attended UCSB. He then introduced his cameraman and told a story about him. While at Indiana University, his cameraman got so drunk that he had a blood alcohol content of .33 and fell of a cliff. 3LAU then challenged Storke Plaza to get crazier than his camera man. Although the concert-goers fell short of the challenge that 3LAU put them up to, it still got pretty wild.</p>\n<p>From his first track, 3LAU had the students with their hands in the air and jumping. There was a lot of interaction with the crowd and it responded well to him. He played many popular tracks that got Storke Plaza going, such as “Listen To Your Heart,” “Letting Go,” “I Need Your Love” and even Blink 182’s “All The Small Things,” which everyone  recited the words to. He also played his smash hit “How You Love Me,” which had everyone dancing and cheering. A mini helicopter flew up above the crowd with flashing lights and one could assume a camera, capturing the view from below.</p>\n<p>As it happened, Saturday night was also the birthday of 3LAU’s girlfriend Cassie. He dedicated a mix of Maroon 5’s “The Path That Leads to You” to Cassie and asked the audience to wish her a happy birthday, which they did.</p>\n<p>Practically all of Storke Plaza was full of sweating, dancing college students while some looked on from the sides of the plaza and the stairs. Towards the back of the plaza, members of the campus group Ambience showed off their mad skills and gave free light shows to students. Two shirtless male students climbed and danced their way up one of the palm trees in the plaza. The audience requested an encore and 3LAU played one last track. At the end of it all, the students in the crowd could be heard chanting “U-C-S-B” before they dispersed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div

one of the biggest little festivals on the Californian coast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://treasureislandfestival.com/2014/\">Treasure Island Music Festival</a> has a little bit of something for everyone. The fest is sporting everything from big room electro-house (Zedd), to classic hip-hop (OutKast), to beachy garage rock (The Growlers), to neo-soul (Jungle), to chillwave (Washed Out) and many more. There are only two stages at this festival, which are adjacent to one another, making it easy to commute back and forth. But wait, there’s more! The set times alternate between both stages, so that no two acts are on at the same time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Yeah, it’s true. You can actually see every single music act at the festival. No more crying that you have to leave Capital Cities early, so you can see Future Islands (*cough* Coachella 2014 *cough*). Nothing makes me sadder than burning thousands of calories hop-scotching across mile-wide fairgrounds from one stage to another and still feeling like I missed out on an act that could very well be the next Modest Mouse.</p>\n<p>Noise Pop, the production collaborative responsible for this particular island getaway, has been in the Bay Area for 22 years and continues to cultivate San Francisco’s Independent Music and Art culture even amidst the increasing prominence of bigger festivals in the area (Outside Lands, I’m looking at you).</p>\n<p>Here is the bottom line: one simply does not turn down going to an island that you didn’t know existed outside of Robert Louis Stevenson’s pirate novel and miss an Alt-J post-sunset show with the San Francisco skyline in the background. Tickets are well worth the $160, because there’s no worry that you’ll have to miss one of the 36 artists due to a scheduling conflict. Heed my word and take advantage of this. Also, show support for Noise Pop and similar production agencies that truly care about the development of Independent Music culture.</p>\n<p><strong>ON THE LINE UP:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Outkast</p>\n<p>Massive Attack</p>\n<p>Zedd</p>\n<p>Alt-J</p>\n<p>The Growlers</p>\n<p>Classixx</p>\n<p>Chet Faker</p>\n<p>TV On the Radio</p>\n<p>Janelle Monáe</p>\n<p>The New Pornographers</p>\n<p>Washed Out</p>\n<p>St. Lucia</p>\n<p>Banks</p>\n<p>Jungle</p>\n<p>White Denim</p>\n<p>MØ</p>\n<p>Polica</p>\n<p>Ryan Hemsworth</p>\n<p>Ana Tijoux</p>\n<p>Asgeir</p>\n<p>XXYYXX</p>\n<p>Ratking</p>\n<p>Tobacco</p>\n<p>Bleached</p>\n<p>Painted Palms</p>\n<p>Cathedrals</p>\n<p>Laura Lisbona</p>\n<p>Bit Funk</p>\n<p>DJ M3</p>\n<p>Anthony Mansfield</p>\n<p>Luxxury</p>\n<p>Motion Potion</p>\n<p>Tamo</p>\n<p>DJ Tom Thump</p>\n<p>MPHD</p>\n<p>Push the Feeling</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/treasure-island-to-deliver-a-music-festival-without-scheduling-conflicts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/treasure-island-to-deliver-a-music-festival-without-scheduling-conflicts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/treasure-island-to-deliver-a-music-festival-without-scheduling-conflicts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/treasure-island-to-deliver-a-music-festival-without-scheduling-conflicts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/treasure-island-to-deliver-a-music-festival-without-scheduling-conflicts/","id":7091,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7090,7089,7088],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tony Bennett Show Gets Cancelled Due to Blackout","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1-IMG_4531.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1-IMG_4531.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"State Street had an impressive crowd of some 1,500 80-year olds in the street in front of the Granada Theatre last night, but the air was not one of delight.

Lectures, UCSB’s premier event company, has much in store for students, with tickets running a third of the normal adult price for shows like Matt Groening and John Cleese.</a> Then there’s the Santa Barbara Bowl, the 4,562-seat amphitheater which is playing Lorde, Ray LaMontagne, Hall and Oates and Foster the People this fall season. We at Artsweek love the local stuff and these two companies never fail to disappoint. So take your pick with our easy-to-follow event guide.

Famous for posting pictures of acne-prone skin in an attempt to show the lies perpetuated by magazines and their Photoshop skills, Lorde has identified herself as a feminist and was named one of Time’s most influential teenagers in the world. To say that Lorde is talented is an understatement; the woman is THE pop goddess of 2014, fighting the likes of Miley Cyrus in pursuit of becoming a “Pure Heroine,” like her newest album title suggests. Fun facts: she loves peanut M&amp;Ms, is from New Zealand and doesn’t have a driver’s license. That’s why she drives Cadillacs in her dreams. Heh.

His latest album, one of five, has been hailed by NPR as “explosively creative,” boasting a 60s-pop tone. This show is part of LaMontagne’s Supernova Tour, which will take him across Canada and the States. Often compared to Otis Redding and Van Morrison, the 41-year-old bluesy guitarist has a strong reputation to withhold. Artsweek suggests you immediately play “You Are the Best Thing” on Spotify and let LaMontagne’s smooth drawl take you away to clicking on Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>TIMELESS DYNAMIC DUO:</h4>\n<p>Daryl Hall and John Oates<br>\nWHEN/WHERE: Sunday, Oct. 19, 7 p.m. SB Bowl<br>\nCOST: $45-$90<br>\nWHY YOU SHOULD GET YOUR HOMEWORK DONE EARLY THAT SUNDAY AND GO: Ahem, this is HALL AND OATES we are talking about here, people! Not only are they the number-one selling duo of all time, but their music has transcended the 70s and is still very present today in the new remix culture, with fans like Ben Gibbard, John Mayer and Gym Class Heroes. This is a chance to see a band your parents listened to when they were in college. And anyway, what could be better than taking the 24x bus downtown to catch Hall and Oates sing “You Make My Dreams Come True?” Nothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>INDIE POP BAND:</h4>\n<p>Foster the People w/ Sylvan Esso and Soko<br>\nWHEN/WHERE: Saturday, Nov. 15, 6:30 p.m. SB Bowl<br>\nCOST: $34.50-$54.50<br>\nWHY YOU SHOULD VACATE ISLA VISTA/THE DORMS THAT SATURDAY AND GO:<br>\nFoster the People is probably most famous for “Pumped Up Kicks,” but there’s more to them than the catchy keyboard beats of that lyrically depressing tune. Fun Fact: according to a Rolling Stone article with lead singer Mark Foster, the intention behind the catchiness of the song was to call out hipsters who would dance to the song without knowing the meaning behind it. (We got you now, hipsters!) The L.A. band, which consists of Foster, bassist Jacob “Cubbie” Fink and drummer Mark Pontius, has put out two albums since forming five years ago. This tour will be in support of the second album, Supermodel, which has received rave reviews.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 13 of Thursday, October 10, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/","id":7089,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7088,7087,7086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Natives Headline Way Over Yonder","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Legends of LA’s traffic abound far and wide, yet the drive down PCH to Santa Monica’s Way Over Yonder festival was shockingly painless on its opening day.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56401\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56401\" data-attachment-id=\"56401\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/p1020729/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?fit=3776%2C2520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3776,2520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"DMC-LX7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380219407\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"11.8\",\"iso\":\"80\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"P1020729\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56401 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"P1020729\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020729.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-56401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guitar loop pedal virtuoso Moses Sumney performs at Way Over Yonder. Devon McNaughton//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Legends of LA’s traffic abound far and wide, yet the drive down PCH to Santa Monica’s Way Over Yonder festival was shockingly painless on its opening day. The weather was a perfect, breezy 75 degrees. The ocean glittered so invitingly that it was tempting to forsake the opening acts in favor of a swim.</p>\n<p>Luckily, WOY made it easy for attendees to busy themselves with attractions outside the festival grounds. Don’t expect the kind of self-sufficient mini world other festivals attempt to create; WOY is instead integrated within the already-fun atmosphere of the Santa Monica pier.</p>\n<p>The grounds were relatively small and contained few dining options. Given the wealth of delicious food and entertainment available immediately outside, the few options made sense. Attendees could easily come and go throughout the day with hardly any lines until the closing acts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The entire festival was characterized by a laid-back vibe. The crowds were never rowdy, the bar area was mellow and many of the performances felt casual. The folk genre lends well to this atmosphere and to another aspect of WOY that stood out: intimacy. There were maybe a thousand attendees at the biggest acts. There were only two stages; one main stage that dominated the festival and a much smaller one inside the carousel house. The carousel stage featured intimate, acoustic performances, but even at the main stage you could get pretty close to the performers and run a good chance of seeing them around the festival later.</p>\n<p>Minutes after entering, in fact, I ran into loop pedal virtuoso Moses Sumney, who would perform later that day. He was extremely sweet and friendly as we chatted about WOY and his upcoming performance.</p>\n<p>“I love the venue,” he said, mentioning that he came last year as an attendee. “It’s beautiful and the weather is just kinda perfect.”</p>\n<p>I first heard of Sumney when he opened for Australian future soul band Hiatus Kaiyote last year, an experience he described as “brain melting.” He said he became good friends with the group and lauded them as “the heaviest soul band out there right now.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bootstraps opened the festival at the main stage to a predictably small crowd. Dreamy, sustained guitar and glittery synth wafted from the stage as the group played with a decent amount of energy for how meager the crowd was. Their set suffered from some sound issues that were not uncommon throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Alternative country band The Far West followed at the carousel stage. In the small space, the crowd felt larger than that of Bootstraps, and was certainly more enthusiastic. Clever songwriting, undeniable chops and an authentic charm characterized their performance.</p>\n<p>In particular, frontman Lee Briante possessed a certain effortless charisma that won over the crowd. I ran into him later and asked about his musical history. He listed his parents as big influences, saying they were true music lovers and had great taste, introducing him to the likes of Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Little Feat.</p>\n<p>Houndmouth, a four-piece alt-country group from Indiana, played the second set at the main stage to a crowd heavily dominated by college kids. Their indie rock and country sound was a unique mix I hadn’t heard before, and it was nice to see a woman on the stage for the first time that weekend.</p>\n<p>The group rocked catchy three-part harmonies, and frontman Matt Myers impressed the crowd with bluesy guitar solos. My personal favorite part of the set, though, was Katie Toupin’s switch from keyboard to guitar and lead vocals on several songs. Houndmouth also played WOY’s sister festival, Newport Folk, earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Moses Sumney stood out as the least conventionally folk act of the weekend. He used his voice and guitar to create loops and then sang over them in his Frank Ocean-esque croon, while another guitarist added subtle ornamentation. Sumney seemed endearingly shy onstage. His sparse, mellow tunes were met with great appreciation from the crowd and were a nice soundtrack to the setting sun.</p>\n<p>Folk heavyweight Lucinda Williams saw an exponential increase in attendance from preceding acts at the main stage. She has built a deserved reputation for meticulously crafted Americana tunes and sounded just as good live as on her records. The mostly older crowd was a bit subdued, and her demeanor onstage was regrettably stiff, but technically the performance was excellent.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56400\" style=\"width: 176px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56400\" data-attachment-id=\"56400\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/p1020748/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=2520%2C3776&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2520,3776\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"DMC-LX7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380225790\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.7\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"P1020748\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56400 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" alt=\"Little Hurricane performs on the carousel stage at Way Over Yonder.

Devon McNaughton//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The last act to grace the carousel stage on Friday, Little Hurricane, delivered a lively set of bluesy tunes reminiscent of the Black Keys. They laid out a funky carpet and vintage end table onstage, making the already intimate show feel like it was taking place in someone’s home. The crowd fed off the energy of their performance and danced more than at any other peformance at the carousel stage. Drummer Celeste Spina wore an exhilarated smile for the entire show that was impossible not to mirror.</p>\n<p>Making my way back to the main stage area, I witnessed the first long line of the day as people scrambled to catch Local Natives. It was apparent that many concert-goers bought tickets just for this moment. Additional lights were set up and they came on 15 minutes late, just long enough for the crowd to get antsy.</p>\n<p>Older people and country fans who had stuck around to check them out absconded after a few songs, leaving a crowd of adoring, but subdued hipsters. Moses Sumney’s guest appearance for a Little Dragon cover was a highlight. Overall, Local Natives’ psychedelic-tinged indie rock made for a satisfying end to day one.</p>\n<p>Day two saw the festival grow significantly more crowded. Joe Pug’s set at the carousel stage had the highest attendance of any I saw there; he seemed to be a local favorite. Though solo acoustic singer-songwriter isn’t exactly an original concept, Joe Pug is good at what he does. His Dylan-esque vocals were impeccable, his delivery personal and affecting.</p>\n<p>Following Pug was surprise highlight Linda Perhacs. To my initial confusion, I entered the carousel house only to find half the crowd sitting cross-legged like school kids at story time. But I soon realized this was the proper way to enjoy her music and I joined them.</p>\n<p>Her psychedelic brand of folk is difficult to describe, but it involves three-part harmonies, trippy vocal effects, acoustic guitar and synth pads. Perhacs, an adorable older lady with a kindly schoolteacher’s voice, had the crowd mesmerized.</p>\n<p>In opposition to Perhacs, Heartless Bastards’ set did not live up to my expectations. Though the band played well, frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom seemed slightly aggravated for most of the show. Several times she interrupted songs to yell at the sound crew, killing the vibe. Her mysteriously uncomfortable stage presence made it difficult to connect with the music.</p>\n<p>Jackson Browne closed out the weekend well with his quintessentially “folk” classics. Browne is a favorite of the Newport Folk Festival, of which he said, “it’s nice there, but it’s nicer here,” a high compliment.</p>\n<p>His no-frills set mixed old standards with new tunes from his forthcoming album, and the crowd adored him. He forgot a verse to “These Days” (one of his biggest hits) and said with a laugh, “I’ve forgotten a lot of words in my time, but never the words to that song,” to which the crowd cheered.</p>\n<p>The casual atmosphere, intimate performances and vibrant location of WOY set it apart from any other festival I’ve been to. The ease with which one can leave the revelry to enjoy Santa Monica prevents burnout and keeps the experience fresh. However, it has the potential to discourage attendees from discovering new bands, since watching an act you’ve never heard of might seem dull in comparison to a dip in the ocean or a ride at the nearby amusement park.</p>\n<p>WOY rewarded those who stuck around with a lineup of diverse and (mostly) excellent acts that were a joy to experience against the idyllic backdrop of the pier. Did Way Over Yonder succeed in having the influence of its sister festival, Newport Folk? Not really. Did it succeed in putting on a really fun weekend? Absolutely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story originally appeared on page 12 of Thursday, October 2, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/","id":7560,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7559,7558,7557],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"FYF…Fest: One Gal’s Guide to the Fest Fest","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Slow and cripple wins the race.

We — all 40,000 of us — received a consolation email from Sean Carlson apologizing on behalf of the canteen thieves at the front lines, the flash-flooded Metro, the Arena incident on Saturday (I’ll get to that), and essentially admitting defeat by concluding with, “I know a few of you may not have plans to come back but hopefully in the future you will hear about how smooth things have become and will change your mind.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But after the first day, I became savvy to the horseshoe monkey wrench that shaped the trek from the main stage to the entrance. The hard truth I had to swallow was that there would be no show hopping — too much ground to cover. It just wasn’t worth it (unless you’re the kind of shotgun DJ who changes the song every 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>Where you walk is what you get. Or, if you’ve got game, you can beat the design, outrun the dazed mass-Mac crowd at the dead end Main Stage, pass them through the bottleneck forest, swim your way through the sea of swirly-twirly acid droppers and catch most of Thundercat at the front entrance.</p>\n<p>Part of why I was floating around having a grand old time was because my line-up picks were not heavily located at the stage in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Unhindered in guitar band-land, I freely moved above ground, where it was up to me to determine how fast or how close.</p>\n<p>Though I happened to win at the logistical crapshoot, I feel the need to honor those who lost. The Arena incident is a touchy subject for a lot of recent FYF vets. Tatiana Gefter of UCSC said the line-up in the Arena on Saturday was the main reason she bought the tickets, a common story. Chet Faker, Todd Terje, Caribou, Four Tet and DJ Harvey. (Ahem, I missed what?)</p>\n<p>Here’s what happened: on the electronic edge of the knife, an arena where the FYF booking agents were voraciously kicking-ass, there were a lot of unhappy campers. Clogged like arterial plaque, the Chet Faker hopefuls congregated in furious mobs around the single entrance to the entire Arena Stage: two escalators.<br>\nAt 5:20p.m. I dipped out of the Arena, leaving a determined Gefter who was ready to cross crutches to get in there. Tip: don’t cry, just dance. I learned then and there, the Arena wasn’t going to jibe for me, so I cut my losses and went to Albert Hammond Jr. and rocked my socks off instead. Post-fest, the bitter bloggers sounded as if they had been robbed of their intrinsic right to Faker. Gefter was so discouraged that she didn’t attempt to go back for Caribou. But according to Speak Volumes Editor Jonny Lipshin, the entrance was reopened in time for Todd Terje.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that an incensed beer vendor told bystanders how it all went down. According to this vendor, FYF’s mythical father, Sean Carlson, was disputing a beer sales percentage previously agreed upon, so the good beer-people refused to sell beer, which one can imagine is a serious problem. The argument heated up near the bottom of the escalators, causing security (who were freaking out) to close the entrance completely. The gridlock lasted throughout Faker’s entire set, while security chased kids out of the stands and twitter exploded.</p>\n<p>Lipshin estimated with the vendor that close to a hundred lucky ones populated the “basically empty” arena, one which maxes out for sports events at around 16,000 seated occupants. You do the math: thousands of scrawny scrappy hipsters squeezing to be under the air-conditioned disco ball fantasy — while inside is only a measly hundred? I’ll admit I was a little PTSD and avoided the Arena until Darkside the next day (which blew my mind with the trippy orb tunnel shooting straight out and Dave Harrington killing it on guitar).</p>\n<p>Regrets: not dancing to Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks’ Little Fang, not singing louder at Mac Demarco (much to the chagrin of my neighbors just enduring the Main Stage until The Strokes), not lying in the grass during Slowdive, and relinquishing my hold on Ty Segall’s pectorals in order to plunge into the writhen snake-pit to pull my friend off the ground. (Speaking of Mac, was anyone else confused when his talkative bassist, Pierce McGarry, turned to Mac and in a spacey tone asked him if he remembered driving their tour bus off a cliff one time. Mac replied, “Oh yeah, I remember that,” to which McGarry replies, “Yeah… there’s like no way we should have survived that.”)</p>\n<p>Successes: spending my last dollars and getting liquored up on a haystack in the beer garden under the swaying blue lights, then infiltrating the gathering Strokes crowd on the left. We slid in among people of our kind. A girl tucked her curls behind her ear to reveal a 12:51 tattoo, and my friend and I had waited a decade to see the band of my formidable youth.</p>\n<p>That dog Julian Casablancas kept us waiting for 15 minutes before he rolled in looking haggard and well-lived in. His voice was the same as ever, opening with “Barely Legal”. I felt I could finally seal off my teenage years, complete when they played “Under Control”. They stuck to Room on Fire a lot, and only played one off the new, less beloved album.</p>\n<p>When it was all over, I remained where I was, denying the lights and the droning country music to ward us all off. We cut to the side, and from against the fence watched the last entrails of a pleasured crowd head off to battle the Metro. Shuffling my feet, taking in the last images, I overheard story swapping, favorites and frustrations. We sang under our breath, “the end has no end, the end has no end”.</p>\n<p>That brings me to my next point: follow your own feet. My friend got us in all good and well, but one fundamental difference in our festival fitness is that I have the agility of a coked-out cheetah comparatively to this poor girl on crutches. I left her and the rest of my group in a nicotine fog and ventured out to seek the many fortunes these two days promised me.</p>\n<p>I learned at Outside Lands (yes, me so lucky!) that you’re there for the music, so don’t go to artists you couldn’t give two shits about, trailing after a group of friends just for the company. If you bought the tickets to see your bands, by all that is good and true, go to them! If you don’t, you have secured your heartstrings in a torture rack to be pulled in opposite directions for two days straight.</p>\n<p>But few people had to endure these circumstances anyway, because the line up was ridiculous. You really couldn’t go wrong. I read an article pre-fest supposedly pairing down the “top” recommendations. Maybe the writers of that review, who included nearly every artist, were on the same page as whoever decided to tack on the second “Fest” after “Fuck Yeah Fest”, or the La Brea (translation: tar pit) Tar Pits, thinking the more the merrier? There were too many great artists and not enough jet-packs. Also in abundant supply all weekend were the perennial “Fuck yeah” jokes and comments from the performers. But all we could do was echo back our unanimous “fuck yeah’s” because it’s true — everyone was feeling fucking great.</p>\n<p>It was the attitude that made everything just fine. Lipshin noted that back in 2012 at L.A. Historic Park they put down mats to keep down the punk-dust. Everyone at the shows I went to was (with the exception of one, Mr. Demarco) down for dirty nostrils because moshing to Against Me! and Ty Segall is more important than breathing.</p>\n<p>After all is discussed, errors and grievances are aired, Lipshin, fondly recounting his consecutive years of Fest Fests concluded, “The line-ups blow my shorts off every time.” And ain’t that the truth.</p>\n<p>Folks, if you can’t handle a little grit, a fight to get to your musical mecca, than stick to your vinyl. If you allow some wiggle room, ride the wave and are willing to make some compromises, this festival has a lot of potential and already does so much right. Passing by those vendors placed next to the giant inflatable piece-of-poop emoji, those thrifty prints calling out to me, and Frank O’Hara references at the used book swap, brought the funky boulevard backdrop of our DIY pastime. Last tip: BYOB. Racking up an alcohol bill to match the cost of your two-day pass is shameful. (I’m not admitting to anything here.) Until 2015 FYF! Hope you get it right-er next year.</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 10 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/","id":7100,"author":{"id":763,"name":"Natalie O'Brien"},"related":[7099,7098,7097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Russian River: Little Festival That Could","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tucked away in the corner of a small beach in a little town thrives a grand festival featuring big-time artists.

For its 37th year, Guerneville hosted a fun weekend of top-notch acts at the Russian River Blues and Jazz Festival. The entertainment included Serbian-born Ana Popovic, New Orleans’ Trombone Shorty and the magnificent Gary Clark Jr.</p>\n<p>From the foodies at the ahi poke booth to the thirsty teen in line for a snow cone, the festival folks found Ana Popovic to be an unexpected delight. “That girl can rock!” admired the middle-aged restaurateur as he prepared a gourmet turkey pesto panini.</p>\n<p>And rock she did. Giving credit to the blazing sun above, she began with her groovy single “Can You Stand The Heat”. Popovic shined in the sizzling heat of Guerneville. She rocked red stilettos and a short, skin-tight silver dress, her unruly Ke$ha hair swinging side to side. She rested her Fender strat on her right hip with her knee jumping out to greet us.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Popovic’s music and fiery style speak of her volatile political past living in former Yugoslavia. Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1976 to a musical family, Popovic picked up the guitar at 15 years old. Against the backdrop of the explosive Milosovic nationalist regime, she honed this craft to become the fierce, unapologetic musician she is today.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising asset of Popovic is her powerful vocals. She speaks like Ana Ivanovic but sings like Etta James. Combine that with her electrifying guitar solos and you’ve got a bluesy rock guitarist with the funky, old school vibe of Albert Collins and WAR. She is quite the foxy lady. In fact, she will be joining the Jimi Hendrix Experience tour, along with all-star musicians including Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang and Bootsy Collins.</p>\n<p>Following the feisty Serbian was a down-to-earth, multi-instrumentalist whose virtuosity would make Mozart blush. As far as hot trombone/trumpet blues musicians go, Trombone Shorty is a ten. He is the lead of Trombone Shorty &amp; New Orleans Avenue, the funk band that incorporates jazzy tones, hip-hop beats and hints of rock and roll.</p>\n<p>His feisty single “Fire and Brimstone” got the audience in the mood to groove. Trombone Shorty illuminated the stage with his compelling solos and sensual voice, while also displaying remarkable chemistry with bass guitarist Michael “Bass” Ballard. His easy way of allowing Ballard to take center stage and show finger-plucking chops gave the effect of a garage band jam session.</p>\n<p>Ripping off his shirt in the middle of the performance, Shorty paid tribute to his New Orleans background by gesturing towards an audience member for her emerald green mardi gras beaded necklace. He brought us to his old N’awlins neighborhood, bouncing across the stage and energizing the crowd with his spunky spirit.<br>\nDon’t underestimate this fantastic artist by his deceiving nickname, which he earned as a wee little six-year-old musician barely as tall as his instrument.<br>\nShorty is just as unpretentious and irresistible as his music is. His sheer soul and ability to move people made him an incredible performer.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, there was one man who controlled the river, and his name is Gary Clark Jr. Prowling onstage in a maroon v-neck and black fedora, Clark’s masculinity was very apparent. “I’m in love with you Gary!” was the common crowd murmur, and the self-taught guitarist returned the love with a mesmerizing take on “Bright Lights”. Clark has the keen habit of turning four-minute songs into 15-minute existential experiences, and the anguish and pain from the creases on his face as he felt up the whammy bar made the audience nearly double over in a frenzy.</p>\n<p>“I feel good,” the thirty-year-old uttered into the microphone, duly gazing at the river with all of its musically-intoxicated inhabitants. 3,000 heads nodded in agreement, especially those who sailed to the festival via canoes and avoided the $55-a-day cover charge.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Russian River Festival brought a big sound to a small town, and the appreciation was felt on every end of Guerneville. Hats off to its creator, Omega Events — this little festival packs a whopper!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 12 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56240\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56240\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/","id":7102,"author":{"id":756,"name":"Jane Huson"},"related":[7101,7100,7099],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Outside Lands Festival: Notes from a Veteran","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nestled away somewhere in between the disc golf courses and barbecue pits of Golden Gate Park, the seemingly instantaneous assembly of labyrinthian fences and headlining stages mark both the conclusio...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Nestled away somewhere in between the disc golf courses and barbecue pits of Golden Gate Park, the seemingly instantaneous assembly of labyrinthian fences and headlining stages mark both the conclusion of whatever poor excuse of a hot season San Francisco calls summer and the inauguration of Northern California’s one-word answer to Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival — Outside Lands (okay, it’s actually two words).</p>\n<p>It’s 11 a.m. Saturday, August 9th (unfortunately, I missed Friday). I hastily packed my festival bag while downing two cups of coffee, and traversed the five city blocks from my parents’ home to get to my fifth consecutive Outside Lands. The park grass was damp from remnants of the morning fog, and the sun, obscured by dark ominous clouds, left the temperature lingering around a chilly 60 degrees: perfect Outside Lands weather. In line for the main entrance, I spotted a man sporting a worn flannel over a grey Joy Division t-shirt approach one of the soldiers of the security guard army. As the guard turned to point him in his desired direction, flannel-man ran through the supply gate into a crowd of festival-goers faster than Usain Bolt sprinting the 100 meter. Every year the hipsters get hipper and the fences grow taller, but some things will never change. I take comfort in this.</p>\n<p>After what seems like an eternity of wading through a sea of tribal-patterned hand-knit shawls and tweed Crossroads suspenders, I reached the entrance at last. The ticket-scanner grunted me in with a powerful indifference that I can only take to mean, “Thanks for your patronage! I wish you a merry time enjoying the beautiful art and world-class music that only this celebration of culture has to offer!” Needless to say, I couldn’t help thinking that the sooner I was on the same side of the fence as the Dum Dum Girls, the better.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Land’s End, the main stage, is located at the edge of a great grassy expanse known as the Polo Fields, and it’s this area that really captures the essence of Outside Lands. The Polo Fields are a vibrant bazaar of festival eateries, merchandise stores and most importantly, urban art installations. Locally famous street artists garbed in HAZMAT suits can be seen spray-painting enormous particle-board canvases with dastardly wizards, feral gorillas and other monsters from your two-year-old’s nightmares. If there’s anything that can be said about Outside Lands it is that, while it does not boast the biggest and best lineup, the festival management does a good job of keeping the party about the art and music and not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Outside Lands does feature some party-oriented music acts (e.g. Duck Sauce, Tiësto and Disclosure, to name a few,) but, unlike most analogous festivals across the country, it does not feature a stage that is headlined by purely dance music acts. In order to have a really good time at Outside Lands, you’ll need to be familiar with some of the artists and know the words to a few songs, and this draws a crowd of devout music fans. When droves of twenty-somethings left Atmosphere early to join the hoard of tired baby-boomers at Tom Petty’s closing set at the end of the night, it was something special.</p>\n<p>While not completely absent at other large festivals, these authentic music fans comprise the majority of Outside Lands attendees, and this makes the Outside Lands community feel refreshing even to veteran festival-goers. Additionally, this allows management to continue to keep booking up-and-coming musicians such as Warpaint and Gold Panda … even if sometimes the bill includes a beat-boxing cello player whose amplifier is powered by a volunteer on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips on having the ultimate OSL experience. First, don’t be afraid to dance like a hippie to your favorite indie act, because people will join you without fail if you dance hard enough. Second, although a little pricy, the chimmichurri fries from 4505 Meats will be worth it every time.</p>\n<p>Third, roam around the festival grounds, and don’t be worried about occasionally losing your friends; you’ll find new friends if you mouth lyrics to songs you don’t know the words to. Fourth, bring a hoodie. If you’re not dancing harder than Samuel T. Herring, San Francisco nights can be about as unforgiving as exile in Siberia. Lastly, see a new act. Support struggling musicians, because acts with goofy names like Yellow Ostrich, Fitz and the Tantrums, or GRiZ might just become your next bread-and-butter group.<br>\n<em>Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival takes place in every year in Golden Gate Park the second week of August.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 11 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/","id":7101,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7100,7099,7098],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Way Over Yonder Festival To Bring Folk Music to Santa Monica","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Newport Folk Festival famously spurred the careers of several beloved artists including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, and Way Over Yonder aims to bring that tradition the West Coast.

The recent Extravaganza headliners are sure to play an exciting set of their psychedelic-influenced tunes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup as a whole represents a wide spectrum of artists falling under the category of “folk”. Folk’s central characteristics have always been hotly contested, making a definition that is difficult to pin down, but Way Over Yonder embraces this variability. Artists must have some roots in the tradition of the travelling American singer-songwriter in order to be considered for the festival, but they are not required to be strictly definable as folk. Way Over Yonder takes pride in following the footsteps of the Newport Folk Festival by expanding the definition of the genre. As a result, even veteran folk fans are sure to hear something new this weekend.</p>\n<p>As far as locations go, it’s difficult to imagine a more idyllic one than the Santa Monica Pier. Festival attendees will be treated with views of the Pacific Ocean just beyond the view of their favorite band. The pier contains its own amusement park, as well as many popular restaurants and shops. There will also be food vendors and several bars within the festival.</p>\n<p>With its strong lineup and enviable location, there is little more one could ask from this festival. Way Over Yonder promises a weekend of good American music and good American fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Visit </em><a href=\"http://www.wayoveryonder.net/\">wayoveryonder.net/</a><em> for tickets and more information.</em></p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56230\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56230\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/","id":7099,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7098,7097,7096],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"L.A.

It was an interesting choice from her fourteen-song album, <em>Midnight in the Garden</em>, and its melancholy lyrics immediately set the tone for her set. Last Wednesday, SOhO served as an intimate space for the L.A. songstress who left all her vulnerability onstage, along with a bottle of Fiji water and her beard-friendly, week-long guitarist/accompanist, Matt Koziol.</p>\n<p>The night began with a pleasant surprise. I, a lowly reporter, happened to walk into the bathroom at SOhO, only to see singer-songwriter Lily Kershaw coming out of the stall, red hair aflame and head-to-toe in black. “Hi, how are you!” she exclaimed, her genial attitude wrapping me in a blanket of confused warmth since she probably had no clue who I was. “I’m good! I’m so excited to be here, it was great to talk to you last week,” I quipped, upon which her warm brown eyes lit up and she realized I was the reporter she conversed with for an hour whilst packing up for the “Like the Sun” tour she was now embarking on.</p>\n<p>She proceeded to introduce me to her mother, a blonde beauty named Whitney, and her publicist, along with her brand-new guitarist Matt, an East Coaster whom she’d gotten to know pretty well over seven days. She picked him up for the tour since her previous band members had gone on another gig. “It’s going to be so funny in Canada, because we are staying in a house, and Matt will be the first man I’ll ever live with!” Kershaw giggled, to which her publicist retorted, “Well yeah, besides your dad!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saying that Kershaw is the bubbliest, most down-to-earth artist I’ve ever encountered would be a severe understatement. At 23 years old, Kershaw has had her music featured on “Criminal Minds,” won #5 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart, and has befriended fellow acoustic guru Paul McDonald, so much that the two may very well form a band. And yet, she remains this kind, generous person, humble in every way. I followed her towards the stage once her opener, Taylor Berrett came on, and the two of us listened to him like a couple of fawning teenage girls. “I have never seen him play before,” she whispered. “I like him!”</p>\n<p>Of course, who couldn’t like the lovable Berrett, whose soft folk melodies, baby-faced good looks and charismatic personality thoroughly governed the stage. He showed instrumental chops by switching from guitar to piano midway through the set, to perform “Whole Heart”, off his debut album <em>Anchor Casting</em>. A native to Sterling, Virginia, Berrett embodied a certain wholesome charm with his easy way at the microphone. More than a couple of times he pumped SOhO up for coming acts, saying, “This is mine and Bobby and Lily’s first show together; don’t worry, the acts get progressively better looking after me”. He offered a sincere apology to the ladies when discussing his fellow tour mate, Bobby Bazini, lamenting, “I apologize to any women with boyfriends, your relationship is about to come to a tragic end. I almost broke up with my girlfriend when I saw Bobby play; so it’s really gonna be hard for a lot of relationships. That’s the cost of art I guess.”</p>\n<p>The talented Bobby Bazini took the stage next, dressed down in a black tee with a silver watch adorning his left wrist. Although he hails from Montreal, not a hint of Bazini’s French-Canadian accent was apparent in song. As a singer, he’s raspy and suave; a lot of soul comes out of Bazini, who crooned into the mic with one eye open. He switched guitars several times, and hit a foot drum, all whilst singing in his throaty, masculine way. Most of the tunes came from his sophomore album, <em>Where I Belong</em>.</p>\n<p>When Lily Kershaw took her place onstage, the air grew intense with the singer’s vulnerability. She sang “Better”, followed by “Midnight in the Garden”, her title track. Her hand clutched the microphone forcefully, as if she needed it to hold her steady; her other hand sat in her leather jacket. Kershaw, who never plays guitar in front of people, pulled out an acoustic guitar spontaneously. “This is probably the third time I’ll play in front of an audience, and the first time I’m doing the song with Matt. This is a song called ‘Take Care’ — my grandfather passed away a couple of weeks ago, and I wrote it for him,” she said, her voice cracking.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the performance was achingly stripped; just Kershaw’s voice and the strums of Koziol, who hadn’t learned all of her songs yet. Instead, they did cover songs the two were both familiar with. Couples leaned closer together as a Leonard Cohen number sprang sweetly from Kershaw’s lips, a love song the man had written about Janis Joplin. The choice of whether to play an Elliot Smith or Miranda Lambert tune ensued in a rock-paper-scissor competition between Kershaw and Koziol, to which Elliot won out, and “Between the Bars” was sung.</p>\n<p>After singing “Like the Sun,” the name of her tour, she walked off the stage in a rush, leaving an ambiguity as to whether it was over yet. She returned to a slightly awkward stage to encore with the Miranda Lambert song, which lost rock-paper-scissors. “I like this one, let’s do it,” Koziol coaxed.</p>\n<p>The song, “The House That Built Me,” secretly had Bob Dylan’s “Wagon Wheel” melded into it, and was the perfect ending to what turned out to be a very sentimental show.

Music Club to see Jim “Kimo” West perform traditional Hawaiian slack-key guitar. For the silly mainlanders, slack-key, or <em>ki ho’alu,</em> is a playing style native to Hawai’i dating back to the mid-19th century. It owes its inception to Mexican-Spanish <em>vaqueros</em> that brought cattle and (yep, you guessed it) the first guitars to the small chain of Pacific Islands, or so the oral history goes. And it sounds about exactly how you might expect — cowboy falls asleep in the desert, wakes up on a tropical island, decides to try that coconut-only diet he’s been hearing so much about, learns guitar to play at bonfires — boom! Slack-key. Back in the 80s, something almost as serendipitous happened to James West, and he’s been “Kimo” (the Hawaiian transliteration of Jim) ever since.</p>\n<p>While “Kimo” is a pioneering musician in his own right, he is best known for shredding lead guitar for “Weird Al” Yankovic since the early days. Bearing this in mind, I wasn’t sure what I was going to find on the other side of SOhO’s main doorway, a club reputed for bringing the most avant-garde acts of today that your parents have never (and would never want to have) heard of. I half-expected to find a typical American misappropriation of Hawaiian culture in the form of a tourist-style <em>luau </em>populated by retired suburban parents sporting shorts that may have been pulled up a tad higher than is deemed socially acceptable. The other half of me expected a steamy, dimly lit room full of plaid-toting college-aged kids, sporting thick black wireframe glasses. I entered the stage room and, to my delight, my overly cynical predictions were incorrect on almost every account (the crowd <em>was</em> a bit on the older side).</p>\n<p>As I scanned the room, I saw Tommy Bahama shirts and dresses worn like uniforms. My eyes caught the wiry curly-haired guitarist from the pictures. He approached me with what might be the warmest “Hey, Alex,” I’ve received since my mom replaced me with a Shih Tzu mutt after I graduated high school. We exchanged the usual pleasantries before he dashed off to get ready for show time.  If anything can be said about “Kimo,” as a person, it’s that he’s an authentically warm guy, a type that I find to be all too uncommon.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I took my seat, and the lights dimmed. He began with a “Hi, I’m ‘Kimo’,” and chatted a bit about slack-key. The first song was just what I expected — slow and entrancing. The song after was of similar taste and tempo. A few songs in, I had mentally prepared myself for an evening of swaying my head from left to right to the soothing melodies of Hawaiian lullabies. He called three dancers on stage. Later in the evening after the show, Jim said to me, ”I always try to bring hula dancers, because it’s such a beautiful dance.” I had never seen live hula, previously.</p>\n<p>The next song started slow. The dancers caressed the melody ever so tenderly, their arms faintly resembling small ripples on the surface of a calm lake. “Kimo’s” slender fingers slowly began to accelerate up and down the neck of the golden guitar. His hand moved at breakneck speeds, and the dancers followed suit. I didn’t know whether to watch the undulating hips of the smiling dancers, or this extreme feat of dexterity. Then, he began to sing in crystal clear Hawaiian. For the next two minutes, I was constrained by the tables and chairs occupying what I desperately desired to be a dance floor. Other audience members squirmed in protest.  The song ended with an emphatic sweep of strings and a hearty round of applause.</p>\n<p>Jim’s set included astounding variety that kept the show fresh and fun by switching between traditional <em>ki ho’alu</em> standards, covers and original works, all of varying tempo. Additionally, around half of the songs had accompaniment from either hula dancers (one of whom, Nani Edgar, doubled as a vocalist,) another guest vocalist, or fiddle. Also, sprinkled in were fun anecdotes from collaborations with other musicians and factoids about Hawaiian culture. “Did you know the steel guitar originated in Hawai’i?” No, I didn’t. Now, I can make my music snob friends feel dumb. Thanks, Jim!</p>\n<p>This show was a breath of fresh air from the indie folk-rock and synth-pop on which I’ve been binging, and the intimate nature of the concert area was a good fit for Jim’s conversational performance style. All in all, if you missed out, then I’m sorry to say it, but you <em>missed out</em>. While Hawaiian folk guitar may be a little down-tempo for some, there’s no disputing it — “Kimo” knows how to wail.</p>\n<p><em>For more information on Jim “Kimo” West, visit his website at <a href=\"http://www.jimkimowest.com/lndex.html\">http://www.jimkimowest.com/lndex.html</a>. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/jim-kimo-brings-hawaiian-sounds-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/jim-kimo-brings-hawaiian-sounds-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/jim-kimo-brings-hawaiian-sounds-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/jim-kimo-brings-hawaiian-sounds-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/jim-kimo-brings-hawaiian-sounds-to-soho/","id":6954,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[6953,6952,6951],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lily Kershaw to Headline SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A 23-year-old singer-songwriter who has been writing since age 13, Kershaw gained international attention in 2012 when her song “As It Seems” appeared on season seven of “Criminal Minds.” Almo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><b>The L.A.

Her cathedral arched windows allow just the right amount of light to get her up, prompting her to grab one of the four guitars lying around her collection of vintage 60s furniture. She starts the day nestled into a parrot-patterned loveseat that was her grandparents’ with a cup of Joe to work on a song and figure out what it wants to be.

It was a fast-paced and intimidating project for the fledgling artist, who had little-to-no experience in the studio. “I literally woke up every night the week prior in a sweat,” remembers Kershaw. “I kept thinking, ‘how am I supposed to do this. How do you make something out of nothing?’ I had these songs and these guitar parts, but I couldn’t imagine bringing them to life.”</span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">From that intense process, Kershaw learned to immerse herself into production, be brave and go with her gut. “There wasn’t a lot of time to figure it out and plan,” she explains. “I hadn’t developed that part of my ear yet for what I wanted surrounding songs I had written acoustically. Now that ear is super developed and I hear instrumentation that I want — the guitar, the piano, the banjo.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Following <i>Midnight in the Garden</i>, Kershaw headed to France for promo and finished a residency at the legendary Hotel Café, a Hollywood coffee shop that has supported the careers of fellow acoustic women Sara Bareilles, Katy Perry, Ingrid Michaelson, and Meiko. Kershaw toured Canada and the States, followed by another trip to France in the spring of 2014. This last year has been spent mostly on the road, with small breaks to stay at home and hole up in her room and write. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Traveling so much has got Kershaw addicted. “I’ve been in L.A. for the last couple of months, and I feel like I need the daily change. It’s becoming a bit of a habit [to be on the road],” she gushes. “There’s something really thrilling about not knowing — every day you meet a bunch of people and learn about them and their lives. I really get curious about people on tour and I end up asking a million questions. And I probably frighten all of them.” </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On her wish list of places to tour are India, Ireland and Scotland — but especially Ireland and Scotland. The attraction has to do with their dark, romantic rainy-ness. Plus, she’d fit right in. “I’m a redhead, I’ve got freckles and I’m pale. I feel like I’d be amongst my people,” Kershaw laughs.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Speaking of redheads, Kershaw has this grand idea she has yet to propose to British acoustic star Ed Sheeran: the Redhead Only Tour. Redheads would perform, work on production, sell tickets, and volunteer as clean-up crew. “I think it would be so funny. [I want to] show some ginger love to a dying breed,” she says. “Tell all your redhead friends that they’ll get free tickets.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In a note of seriousness, Kershaw admitted that someone tried to kidnap her once. “But I can’t talk about that,” she says, somberly, before unleashing some details. “I did have a situation where somebody wanted me to leave with them and security was called. Life is weird as a musician!” When asked whether she would put the escapade into a song, she laughs. “I think I’m just gonna try to avoid kidnappers in the future — nobody come take a nap near me! Maybe that will be the song. <i>No naps allowed</i>.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Contrary to her bubbly, effervescent personality, Kershaw’s music speaks of another side of this adorable songstress — a darker, aching side haunted by nostalgia. <i>Midnight in the Garden</i> is filled with stories of heartbreak and death. “The first record I wrote was between the ages of 17 and 21, and it was the transitory time when you’re figuring out new aspects of yourself and you’re having some real life experiences.” </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">There’s been a lot of loss for Kershaw — a close high school friend of hers passed away shortly after leaving for college, a good friend and “Sons of Anarchy”<i> </i>actor named Johnny Lewis died tragically in 2012 and just in the last two weeks she’s experienced the death of her grandfather and a best friend’s father. These experiences have inspired this already-prolific writer. “I’ve been writing a lot more than usual just because there are more things on my mind, a lot more things I wanna get out of my body. Different types of sadness.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Lily Kershaw’s art is that she takes the hard stuff from life — death, breakups, loneliness, depression — and places them into a song as a way of healing. It’s a way to take life head on and receive closure, and this feeling of compassion and triumph resonates with her adoring audience, who has made sure that <i>Midnight in the Garden</i> hit the #5 spot on iTunes Singer/Songwriter Album Chart. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Songwriting allows Kershaw to maintain her ordinarily happy, sweet, grateful self; a girl whose friends call her “baby cat” and whose life aspirations include touring with Damien Rice and saving all the elephants in the world. In addition to her thanks for the existence of motorcycle boots, the color black and Paul Simon, big thanks from Kershaw goes to her record label Nettwerk for giving her creative control. </span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Other studios expect the artist to be an idea. I don’t want to be an idea. I want to be a feeling and a person … you can’t put that in a machine. And I don’t think people want a machine. I think people want people.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>Lily Kershaw is headlining SOhO on Wednesday, Sept. 10 at 7:30 p.m. as part of her “Like the Sun Tour” through the States and Canada.
