After touring the world and performing in various venues, including Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl, Chen returned to Santa Barbara after two years prepared to entice an audience eager to hear more.</p>\n<p>It is easy to say that Chen’s niche, classical music, is known for putting kids to sleep, while or helping plants grow. Suffice to say, many categorize classical music to be rather boring—especially in this newer generation. However, this event was held by UCSB Arts and Lectures and subsequently brought together an audience full of young adults. I was curious to see how Ray Chen would interpret the pieces to appeal to the younger generation.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a gray suit, black dress shoes and slicked hair, Chen walked on stage with the utmost determination to begin the concert immediately. Without a single word, he began to play intensely. However, within 30 seconds, his face turned from a red sphere of ferocity to a joyous, not unlike that of a young child. The audience suddenly began laughing and saw as they noticed him mimicking his music with his facial expressions.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Following his first two pieces, Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No. 1 and Saint-Saëns’ Violin Sonata No. 1, the audience rose to give a standing ovation. While embracing his accompaniment, pianist Julio Elizalde, Chen finally spoke a couple words to the audience, wiping the sweat off his forehead and settling down.</p>\n<p>As half-time came to an end, the performance veered off in a completely different direction as Chen took on a sonata for solo violin by Ysaÿe. His childish, carefree demeanor transformed into an expression of pain and sorrow. It quickly became clear that the attention of the crowd was drawn away from the violin to Chen’s facial expressions. With every stroke of the bow, Chen’s face curled into a deeper scowl.</p>\n<p>He lifted the spirits of the audience within 15 seconds of the next performance, Falla’s <em>Suite populaire espagnole, </em>in which he transformed his classical violin into a little ukelele. He plucked the violin with one hand and created a beat with the other,[[delete comma]] to initiate a hall-wide clap for his next piece. It made me appreciate the music even more, as it allowed me to listen to classical music in a complete different light—a fun, lighthearted one.</p>\n<p>He concluded his performance by introducing the piece, <em>Czardas </em>by Monti with a light joke, and engaging the audience even more. As soon as he completed the final stroke of the bow, the audience rose and clapped for an “everlasting four minutes.” The clapping became louder and louder as Chen bowed humbly, and it was an awesome experience.</p>\n<p>Chen’s performance allowed audience members to appreciate classical music as something exciting and funny. If you did not get the chance to catch his performance this past Wednesday at Hanh Hall, be sure to take a chance on Chen at least once—He had the power to unite a diverse group of grandparents, UCSB students and elementary schoolers solely by putting a smiles on their faces. He was definitely worth it.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/young-classical-violinist-takes-students-by-storm-at-hahn-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/young-classical-violinist-takes-students-by-storm-at-hahn-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/young-classical-violinist-takes-students-by-storm-at-hahn-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/young-classical-violinist-takes-students-by-storm-at-hahn-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/young-classical-violinist-takes-students-by-storm-at-hahn-hall/","id":6882,"author":{"id":734,"name":"Ketaki Malaviya"},"related":[6881,6880,6879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Florence + Bowl = One Big, One Blue, One Beautiful Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Florence_by-McLane-Brown-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Florence_by-McLane-Brown-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Reaching out into the audience with welcoming arms, she asked us to remove something weighing us down, keeping us on the ground.

Florence soon emerged from the wings barefoot, bathed in golden light as she stopped center stage. In the quiet, the set was in constant motion — the back-drop shimmered in the breeze, covering the stage in brilliant blue waves. As if she were singing on the sea, Florence opened the show with “What the Water Gave Me.”</p>\n<p>The energy of her entrance continued to hold strong. During her third song, Florence dashed out into the audience, running through the aisles with a wide grin on her face as she reached out to the crowd as she glided by. After she’d finished, she stood breathless on the stage, holding an article of clothing someone had thrown. She commented gleefully that this was the earliest someone had thrown clothing to her in a performance, and that this meant it was going to be a great show.</p>\n<p>Florence’s ability to reach out and relate to the audience was evident not only in her stunning performance, but also in the breaks between songs. She recounted her time in the United States two years ago while on her last tour, telling us of how she fell in love everywhere she went. Speaking with the upmost tenderness and respect, Florence proclaimed she wrote “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful” about the American skies. Singing it again in the states, she brought the song full circle with an open heart and stars in her eyes.</p>\n<p>With every song, the group brought a new meaning to the night. “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful” was a love story between landscapes, one that she ended in a dance of rapid spinning and twirls. “Rabbit Heart” was a thrilling, practically mystical experience as Florence asked us to stand up, to jump and reach to the skies to get “as high as we can.”</p>\n<p>It was a roller coaster of emotion. Between her unchained dance breaks, her down-to-earth stories, and her powerful vocal performance, Florence put her heart and soul into this concert. After singing one of the group’s most popular songs, “The Dog Days Are Over,” the entire group left the stage, only to come back minutes later for a two-song encore. Florence was silhouetted by golden rays, her arms spread wide as she stared straight into the crowd. A man in the back row mirrored everyone’s thoughts perfectly as he shouted, “It’s Jesus! It’s British Jesus!”</p>\n<p>The highlight of the night, however, was before Florence sung “Shake It Off.” As if she were looking at every individual in the crowd, she asked us to remove something — to take off our burdens, our sufferings, and to throw it as hard and far as we could.</p>\n<p>Not only did she sing to us, but she sang with us. As she did in Santa Barbara and will continue to do on her tour, Florence lives life to the fullest, and gracefully invites us to sing along.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/florence-bowl-one-big-one-blue-one-beautiful-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/florence-bowl-one-big-one-blue-one-beautiful-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/florence-bowl-one-big-one-blue-one-beautiful-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/florence-bowl-one-big-one-blue-one-beautiful-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/florence-bowl-one-big-one-blue-one-beautiful-show/","id":6883,"author":{"id":733,"name":"Karrah Bates"},"related":[6882,6881,6880],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pure Bathing Culture to Cleanse SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pure_bathing_culture_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pure_bathing_culture_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Sunday, Nov. 1 SOhO will host a night of authentic Portland indie-pop.

Wild Ones will take the stage at 9 p.m. followed by headliner Pure Bathing Culture. Pure Bathing Culture released their second full-length album <em>Pray for Rain</em> on Partisan Records on Oct. 23, 2015. Their first tour will help establish this Portland band’s eclectic sound. Pure Bathing Culture boasts the multi-talented Sarah Versprille and Daniel Hindman. Versprille plays keyboards and serenades listeners with her expressive vocals. Hindman creates captivating melodies on the guitar and keyboards.</p>\n<p>The two first met at their freshmen orientation at William Patterson University in New Jersey. They became a part of the group Vetiver and moved to Portland in 2011. After sticking with the band for two albums, Pure Bathing Culture surfaced as its own entity as the result of accidentally genius conspiracy. As Versprille began writing lyrics over Hindman’s instrumentals on guitar, the band formed naturally. “Lost One,” the pair’s first track independent of Vetiver, reached producer Richard Swift who encouraged them to continue making music together.</p>\n<p>After releasing their self-titled EP on Father/Daughter Records, Pure Bathing Culture began playing live shows in 2012. Their early music layers multiple guitar riffs over mellow and interesting accents on the synths. The duo released their first full-length album <em>Moon Tides</em> on Partisan Records in 2013. Some critics compared their most popular single, “Pendulum,” to the style of Fleetwood Mac. Although saturated with love songs, the constant differences between tracks served to differentiate Pure Bathing Culture from other indie-pop groups.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Pray for Rain </em>veers from the group’s signature layering style. The production delivers a sound true to what they perform at live shows. This album explores the fear of existence with an animated tempo. Hindman’s clean guitar lines texturized with Versprille’s lucid vocals create such soothing melodies that the depth of the lyrics blurs into the background. Focusing on the carefully crafted lyrics exposes the true artistry it takes to hide such a visceral mood behind vivacious tones. Pure Bathing Culture conceives the kind of music that instills a lightheartedness in the darkest of thoughts.</p>\n<p>The palpable rawness procured in <em>Pray for Rain</em> will earn them fans by the masses. This album is a transition away from hiding behind the stereotypical and toward an authentic sound that is characteristically Pure Bathing Culture.</p>\n<p>Also stemming from Portland, Wild Ones relies on heavy synths and adolescent melodrama to reach their radiating style of pop. The bouncing bass lines and rhythmic vocals leave traces of new-age R&amp;B in their wake. Each member of this five-person group comes from a wildly disparate musical background. From punk to classical, their spectrum of talent blends seamlessly in their most recent EP <em>Heatwave</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65902\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/pure-bathing-culture-to-cleanse-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65902\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/pure-bathing-culture-to-cleanse-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/pure-bathing-culture-to-cleanse-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/pure-bathing-culture-to-cleanse-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/pure-bathing-culture-to-cleanse-soho/","id":6881,"author":{"id":731,"name":"Jordan Metz"},"related":[6880,6879,6878],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Music Professor Performs Rare Beethoven Piece","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/piano.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/piano.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Surrounded by the austere brick walls of the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall and lit by faint purple lights, a black grand piano with gold feet awaited the arrival of Professor Paul Berkowitz.

The professor has been a part of the faculty at UCSB since 1993 and served as the Chair of the Department of Music from 2007 to 2012. Apart from his time spent as Chair, he has performed a piano recital nearly every year at the school.</p>\n<p>A graduate of McGill University and of the Curtis Institute, Berkowitz has recorded the complete piano sonatas of Schubert to worldwide recognition. His recordings have been recognized as some of the best by the <em>London Sunday Times </em>and BBC Radio. He recently recorded Schubert’s <em>Impromptus</em> in 2013 and the <em>Moments Musicaux </em>in 2014. These two records will be the eighth and ninth volumes of the cycle of Schubert’s works that Berkowitz began to tackle in 1984. The new records will be released along with all earlier volumes as <em>The Complete Major Piano Works of Schubert. </em></p>\n<p>The crowd filed in, eager to hear Beeethoven’s rarely played “33 Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli.” The pianist stepped onstage, and the crowd erupted into applause. As the roar of the audience started to dwindle, a smile crept onto Berkowitz’s face as he introduced the unfamiliar piece.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Anton Diabelli, a composer and publisher, asked fifty of Austria’s best composers to write a single variation on his waltz. Beethoven saw this as an opportunity to create a large set of variations. This piece of Beethoven’s art has been entitled the most adventurous work by the composer. Some have even dubbed it the greatest set of variations ever written.</p>\n<p>After a comprehensive lecture regarding the standard technique in writing variations, listeners thought they knew what to expect. They didn’t. To the musically uneducated ear, the similarities seemed indistinguishable, but the variations were so vastly different that it would be more accurate to call them transformations.</p>\n<p>Berkowitz executed the first variation with gusto. His reverence for the piece was evident in every note. The next variation constituted an intense building up of energy into a surprisingly sweet melody. As the professor continued through the piece, the notes seemed to move around each other; he even crossed his hands over each other to achieve the complex structure of the music. The serenity of one variation was abandoned as Berkowitz moved on to the next. Beethoven shocks listeners with a clashing thicket of chords. Berkowitz became so intently fixated on the music that he lost himself in the keys. The abruptness with which the music changed direction caused the professor himself to jolt from his bench.</p>\n<p>Moving away from suspense and drama, an underlying humor appeared. Berkowitz really began to perform. His grand gestures when playing the imposing chords and exaggerated focus in striking the singular high notes yielded chuckles from the audience. He made himself at home with the piano.</p>\n<p>The piece explored the emotions of romance. Berkowitz created ethereal harmonies, provoking the audience to tilt their heads to the side in awe. His refusal to merely play the notes was electrifying.</p>\n<p>The final three variations switched keys with an intense dramatic effect. After such a long period in the same key, the piece stepped into the peculiar. Berkowitz impressed the audience yet again with his mastery of such an adventurous stream of chords. Although he had warned the crowd, the end of the fugue was so shocking, members of the audience jumped back in their seats, laughing to themselves in wonderment.</p>\n<p>In addition to Beethoven’s genius composition, the stylistic authority Professor Berkowitz contributed created no ordinary piano recital. It was rightly a show not easily forgotten, and a display of the talent he possesses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

concluded with their Block Party at the Funk Zone featuring Gardens &amp; Villa and Run the Jewels, on Sunday, Oct. 18. Bustling food trucks lined the venue, which spanned a small outdoor stretch of parking lot.</p>\n<p>The audience was fairly heterogeneous. In one corner of the venue, a visibly annoyed high school student tried to escape his hovering mother. In another section, an elderly couple slowly crept towards the main stage. Most of the young adults congregated at the beer garden.</p>\n<p>Gardens &amp; Villa took the stage. Immediately, the crowd synced up with Garden’s keyboard-heavy indie pop music. Crowd members couldn’t look away from the psychedelic light show onstage and grooved along to Chris Lynch’s slight raspy but ethereal vocals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lynch unexpectedly punctuated Garden’s colorful set with his flute. Projections of spindly spiders on the wall accompanied the Lynch’s flute.</p>\n<p>Before Run the Jewels went on, some fans rushed to the front to ensure that anyone who was less than six feet tall had a very difficult time seeing anything other than a sea of shoulders and heads. Adam Schmidt, a second-year computer science major, UCSB’s College of Creative Studies said, “The sound guy came up and did sound checks for 15 minutes which were punctuated by his ‘Yeahs’ and ‘Alrights,’ sounding like a slightly more decipherable Lil John record stuck on repeat.” The man onstage instead “seemed to be doing his job of hyping pretty well, as soon the fans were cheering loudly for Run the Jewels,” Schmidt said.</p>\n<p>Finally, RtJ MCs El-P and Killer Mike made their grand appearance, in the process driving some fans into a frantic mosh pit in the middle of the audience. The duo opened up not with one of their own songs, but instead led the crowd in a rousing rendition of a “We Are the Champions” sing-along, while El-P proclaimed that he had gained superpowers from all of the weed he smoked before the show.</p>\n<p>Run the Jewel’s set had no shortage of vulgarity — middle fingers and drug references were staples throughout the night — but the duo did not hesitate to voice their political opinions or call out fans who they felt were restricting anyone else’s enjoyment. Killer Mike and El-P made their disapproval of the government clear, and told a daring photographer who saw fit to climb the railing that he had to move because “[the photographer’s] dick is in kids’ faces.” These instances where the duo spoke what was on their minds served to amp the crowd’s excitement to a higher level than it already was.</p>\n<p>To add to the energy, the chemistry between the rappers was palpable. “Honestly I heard they were really good performers before and they pretty much kept up with that reputation; the energy was really good and they were hilarious,” Chet Manley, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student, said. “Killer Mike and El-P are adorable together; they totally had like a bromance thing going on.” The end result was that nobody in the crowd ever stopped moving — the guys in the mosh pit went from pushing each other around to punching each other in the face, and everyone else quickly forgot any inhibitions they may have had about dancing in front of strangers.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after a much requested encore, Run the Jewels finished their set and left the stage, leaving everyone in the audience with dazzling memories and sore bodies. “In essence, Run the Jewels captured the spirit of the crowd and ran f*cking laps with it … Well worth 25 dollars and far cheaper than a diamond necklace,” Schmidt concluded.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/","id":6878,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6877,6876,6875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tijuana Panthers Rock New Noise","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tijuana_Panthers_Press_Photo_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tijuana_Panthers_Press_Photo_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Velvet Jones in downtown Santa Barbara is a venue that attracts a diverse group of music lovers — anyone ranging from angst-ridden teenagers to adults attempting to relive their glory days.

At every corner there were guys who looked like they were part of a band and girls who wanted to seem as though they had a diverse taste in music. The lights were dimmed, so it was difficult to see the giant poster of Johnny Cash flipping everyone off or the expressions of the adults hanging around the bar pounding away their beers.</p>\n<p>The crowd itself was relatively calm; most of the audience talked at a quiet murmur, while everyone else was absorbed in their phones. This ambiance changed once the first band, Royal Suns, came out. After that, the atmosphere progressively became more excited. Once the Aquadolls came out singing “Tweaker Kidz” off their newest album, the audience’s energy level elevated to the point where some people began to dance to Melissa Brooks’ bubbly voice and the upbeat instrumentals. Joseph Olivo, a high school student, decided that this was the perfect time to go crazy, despite the fact that everyone else in the crowd was content with simply swaying to the beat. “This is my eighth time seeing them. The whole band is just amazing,” he said as he stood panting and sweating through his Summer Twins long-sleeve baseball t-shirt.</p>\n<p>Not even Joseph was prepared for how insane the crowd became once the headliner, the Tijuana Panthers, took the stage. The second the band played the first note of “Creature,” everyone in the audience erupted into a giant mosh pit that remained a constant fixture throughout their set. Suddenly, the area in front of the stage was flooded with a medley of rowdy teenagers and older adults aggressively dancing as the Tijuana Panthers played back-to-back tracks from all three of their albums.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The band took minimal breaks, pausing only to politely refuse an audience member’s enthusiastic suggestion to “Take it off!” Luckily, the crowd was not discouraged and continued to vigorously move around the pit; there was not one body that stayed still during their entire set. The only time the audience went crazier than usual was when the band began playing songs from their very first album. Phil Shaheen, the drummer for the Tijuana Panthers, agreed, “I think the old ones from our first record—they, like, always get a good reaction. Everyone sings along and stuff; it seems like the tendency is to go hard.” As the night wore on, the air inside the venue became thicker and thicker with the sweat of both the audience members and the band, to the point where everyone was drenched.</p>\n<p>Because of how rowdy the crowd was, some of the sweat that clung to people’s bodies didn’t always belong to them. Sadly, after about an hour-long set the band bid the audience farewell. Naturally, no one in the crowd wanted to accept that their wild night was coming to a close, and an urgent cry for an encore quickly arose from all areas of the venue. Not the type to disappoint their fans, Tijuana Panthers dutifully came back onstage and played three more songs before finally saying goodbye. Chad Wachtel, the guitarist, was sweet enough to stay behind to converse with some of the audience members and take picture with them, while the rest of the band seemed in a hurry to pack their equipment onto their truck. Surprisingly, their eagerness to tear down their set was due to the fact that the band members had to drive back to their hometown in Long Beach, CA. “I mean, I’m going back to work tomorrow morning,” Shaheen said. “You gotta do something unless you’re huge — you gotta make ends meet somehow.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara can most definitely expect another appearance by the Tijuana Panthers. “We’re for sure coming back,” bassist Daniel Michcoff said. “We’re aiming for [the Santa Barbara bowl].”</p>\n<p>Their promise to come back is definitely great news to new fan David Kuperman, a second year communication and philosophy major at UC Santa Barbara. “My friend dragged me to the show, but I’m very glad I went. The music was fantastic, well-organized and high energy. I would definitely come see them again,” Kuperman said</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQqQ9kfZUn0</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/","id":6925,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6924,6923,6922],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Cuba-America Line That Actually Works","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_0297.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_0297.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The temperature was in the eighties and a soft wind only partially helped with the damp, clingy air on Tuesday night.

Bright lights extended over the sidewalk, overarching and blanketing a piece of State Street. A warm night and a gentle breeze blowing through downtown Santa Barbara set the perfect atmosphere for a night of Latino music and energy.</p>\n<p>The Buena Vista Social Club, also called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, originally began their performances at a members-only club in Havana, known as The Buena Vista Social Club. Amid cigar smoke seeping through un-conditioned air and sweeping dresses flinging color ecstatically around tux-clad waiters, true artistry was born.</p>\n<p>After some key members passed away, those remaining — guitarist Eliades Ochoa, singer and dancer Omara Portoundo, laúd instrumentalist Barbarito Torres, trumpeter Manuel “Guajiro” Mirabal and trombonist Jesús “Aguaje” Ramos — banded together to spread their music across the world. Decades later, they decided to enlighten Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The regal decor of the Granada Theater felt foreign and out of place. A semi-outdoor venue with café-style seating and a makeshift wooden dance floor seemed a much more apropos locale for such an event. Walking into The Granada slightly diminished the Latin vibes, but not for long.</p>\n<p>Soon after 8:00 p.m. a lone pianist, Rolando Luna, stepped on stage and took his seat at the piano in the corner. Dressed all in black, he began to play simply and easily. Immediately the sense of a spirited and cultured community was felt throughout the audience. A screen situated farther upstage projected images exhibiting the history of the club and the band. Pictures of deceased band members filtered from old photos and video footage filled the screen, highlighting certain performances and moments in the history of the organization.</p>\n<p>After about 20 minutes a handful of people were already loosening up the tightly-knit seating at the theater, twisting and turning as the music carried them. “Hup! Hup! Hup!” repeatedly resounded from the stage as Carlos Calunga’s voice reverberated throughout the space. Within 40 minutes, the majority of the crowd were caught moving their feet to the rhythm and beats. The pit was a sporadic flurry of dancers and “sitters.”</p>\n<p>Most of the concertgoers were older people, although there were many generations there — children with parents attempting to send their musical tastes down the line and young adults who’d already learned from their parents. However, no age could detain the insane urge to move one’s hips and throw one’s arms high above. Very soon it became obvious that every track was a crowd favorite, especially “Chan Chan” and “Candela.”</p>\n<p>Not only was it obvious that these musicians were among the best, but they also unexpectedly engaged the crowd. They played a smooth jazz version of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and involved the crowd in singing the lyrics, although there was a lot of pauses and “la da-da-da da dah’s,” interrupted by nervous, yet joyful, bursts of laughter.</p>\n<p>The Social Club was extremely humorous on stage as well. Ramos, who had a large hand in leading the group, playfully pointed out members in the crowd. He also flirted via trombone with a particularly dance-crazed woman in the audience. Torres, who masterfully fiddled the laúd all night, challenged Calunga to a laúd play-off. Torres ended up winning by playing the instrument behind his back, as Calunga held it for him. The Social Club transcended the barriers of age, and the impeccably, almost overpowering energy emanating from the band was palpable through every pore.</p>\n<p>Enter Omara Portuondo, the member with the strongest stage presence despite being one of the oldest. As soon as she entered the stage, she captivated the audience so actively that, disregarding the one slow song she played, the crowd stayed dancing for the rest of the show. Not only was she able to control the stage while performing fast or slow tracks, she dominated the venue.</p>\n<p>If she told the crowd to sing along, they did. When she told us to get up and dance, clap their hands, circle their hips, whatever it was, we immediately obeyed and could not be happier. Upon her entrance into the show, she instantly ignited The Granada, transporting it and everyone inside back to Havana, Cuba. She inspired the entire crowd to sing along to “Besame Mucho,” coordinating an accompanied duo consisting of her singular true voice and a blurry echo. She danced throughout the stage, flicking and swirling her wrists, while effortlessly sliding from song to song. Almost stopping the show at one point out of pure pride, she introduced her husband, the rhythm guitarist Papi Oviedo. His pleasure and joy came through when he stopped playing and stood up to dance with Portoundo.</p>\n<p>When asked to speak on the show he just performed, Ochoa said simply in Spanish, “I’m sorry, no time, because we have got to go play the White House tomorrow.” They will be the first Cuban band to play in the White House in fifty years. The culture exuded from these amazing and experienced musicians made this reporter feel the Buena Vista Social Club. This is where the Latino fiesta that spun the world dancing began.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/a-cuba-america-line-that-actually-works/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/a-cuba-america-line-that-actually-works/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/a-cuba-america-line-that-actually-works/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/a-cuba-america-line-that-actually-works/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/a-cuba-america-line-that-actually-works/","id":6879,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6878,6877,6876],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rocktober In the Hub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/OK7_CSIiWTdx1Pwfe4eWwdFi554k0_kVh1QjccHtlvNUSex9w1jxVGm4KA5kDDtYVIcXCAw775-h770.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/OK7_CSIiWTdx1Pwfe4eWwdFi554k0_kVh1QjccHtlvNUSex9w1jxVGm4KA5kDDtYVIcXCAw775-h770.jpg?resize=775%2C517&ssl=1","description":"The good old Hub: It’s the origin of the pungent smell of freshly cooked orange chicken when you walk by the UCen.

It’s where you may or may not be willing to get in a fist fight with a fellow Gaucho over a study spot in the booths. But most importantly, it’s probably where you went to see your first on-campus concert your freshman year. After all, the Hub is a communal and multi-purpose space that hosts loads of concerts sponsored by A.S. Program Board every year.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, artists from E-40 to Steve Aoki have made appearances in the Hub. This last Thursday, Oct. 15, they hosted Rocktober: a chance for local rock bands to show off their musical prowess. Filled with gnarly guitar riffs and buckets of sweat, Rocktober showcased some of I.V.’s finest.</p>\n<p>Upon descending the staircase into the dimly lit nook that is the Hub (for free!), what stood out the most was the utter lack of people. It was a Thursday, and all of those S.T.E.M. major midterms are on the horizon. That makes sense. However, the nine people that were in attendance stood an awkward five feet away from the stage, preferring the shadows over the barrier spots illuminated by the orange hue of the stage lights behind the band.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Oh, please God, no. It was the initial “I arrived too early to this concert and I want to hide” phase of the night. However, after a strong performance of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie,” the crowd began to warm up to the first act and drifted to the barrier. The first act was a Roots Reggae/Rock quintet hailing from Torrance, CA named West Swell. Barefoot and humbly dressed in jeans and a tee, the lead singer, Steve Ingraham said, “Thanks for coming out on a Thursday night. I’ve got an 8 a.m. tomorrow — I’m sure there’s a few of you out there that have one, too.”</p>\n<p>A few incredible guitar solos by lead guitarist Lucas Gutierrez and one rendition of “Higher” later, West Swell’s set suddenly came to a standstill due to some cringe-worthy speaker frequency. Ingraham kept his cool and cracked jokes. Alas, the band (who look like they could be your next door neighbors on Sabado) concluded their set with “Don’t Stop”.</p>\n<p>Next up to the main stage was Sun Daes, a Reverberated Pop/Surf Rock band that channeled the Urban Outfitters catalogue aesthetic. Their hip clothing choices ranged from a floral button up to oxblood dress shoes. Fortunately, their music was as refined and perfected as their hairstyles.</p>\n<p>Sun Daes kicked the energy up a notch with “Pyro,” an upbeat, beachy tune with some seriously cryptic lyrics.</p>\n<p>“You guys really had nothing else to do on a Thursday night?” one of the vocalists, Max Goldenstein, asked the growing crowd.</p>\n<p>“Ha, just kidding. Rocktober!” he said, holding up devil horns.</p>\n<p>The Daes’ set was seamless. While clean vocals rang throughout the Hub, the small crowd of dedicated fans happily jumped around. By the time Sun Daes made way for the next act, they were soaked in sweat and fanning themselves — clearly a sign of a successful show.</p>\n<p>If the point of Rocktober, however, is to showcase what I.V. has in store for rock lovers, Savage Henry stole the show. Okay, maybe it was the guitarist that stole the show because his speaker was turned up so loud that his instrument was the only one heard (technical difficulties became an expected thing). But maybe this was a blessing in disguise. With his cuffed burgundy pants and his vintage style glasses, he coolly delivered some impressive riffs without breaking a sweat.</p>\n<p>Savage Henry knew how to read the crowd. The lead vocalist jumped around, slowly flapped his arms as if he were a swan and stomped his feet. The crowd went wild with the relentless vigor served up hot by the band. The boys lived up to their “savage” name in a good way. By the end, a mosh pit was in full swing, much to the dismay and delight of attendees.</p>\n<p>After an explosive performance, a laid back finale was much needed. Rocktober delivered that with The Hypno Rings. As the free-styling smooth rock group played, the crowd swayed along.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a night well spent. The only way it could have been made better? No school the next day.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_65732\" style=\"width: 785px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1349583516\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65729\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65732\" data-attachment-id=\"65732\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/rocktober-in-the-hub/20r2yhxm2t04a5rcjmux-tzlnd5quuxz80gbesnd7siivvwy2vm9juf_ej-tvelxhvjilaw775-h770/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?fit=775%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"775,517\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlA=w775-h770\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?fit=775%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65732 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?resize=775%2C517\" alt=\"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"775\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?w=775&amp;ssl=1 775w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20r2yHxM2t04A5RCjmux-tZlND5qUuxz80gBEsnd7sIivVWy2vm9jUf_ej-tVELXhvJIlAw775-h770.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65732\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Not trying to sound like a character from “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” but Hozier left his fans looking for more. The Irish singer-songwriter’s visit to Santa Barbara on his debut solo tour was filled with hopes and promises of a potentially incredible night. However, the concert fell short in duration because the set time was only one hour and 20 minutes long. The show felt like a music festival set, due to his single LP discography. Nonetheless, Hozier’s soulful voice still mesmerized the audience through his personally written and produced songs.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8:10 p.m., the stage lights dimmed to indigo colors and the seating area slowly faded to black. Hozier walked up to the microphone while carrying his electric guitar. The opening song, “Like Real People Do,” spoke of endless possibilities of a new romantic relationship while retaining the memories of past experiences. Some of the standout songs from the set list include, “Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene,” “Someone New,” “It Will Come Back” and “Arsonist’s Lullabye.” As the show continued, Hozier’s next song, “In A Week” had a special guest duet from none other than his right-hand cellist on tour, Alana Henderson. Together, they sang a beautiful love song that resonated across the stage to the lovers who were in the audience.</p>\n<p>In an exclusive interview with <em>Daily Nexus</em> before the concert, Irish folk singer Henderson sat down and talked about supporting the “Take Me to Church” phenomenon on tour. The 27-year-old was offered a chance to perform with the then up-and-comer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

But after all, fans were awaiting a religious experience, and six-foot-five talent was there to bless the crowd. That true religious experience came when the crooner blessed the crowd with the opening lines, “My lover’s got humor/She’s the giggle at a funeral.”]] People chanted and yelled the hit song as if it was their mission to be heard. Many thought the singer would end the night with the chosen song, but Hozier was quick to prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>After thanking everyone on his tour, from the band to the light support, the Irish native walked off stage. Fans were sad to see him leave, but Hozier came back with nothing but a guitar for a final encore.</p>\n<p>For the icing on the cake, the 25-year-old closed out his concert with “Work Song,” a dedication to a lover who has saved him from his troubles. After the band bowed to the audience and the applause came to silence, fans left the Bowl with a renewed appreciation for the old blues.

Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment truly designed this festival with the attendee in mind. Shuttles that run all day made travel to and from the island a breeze. Two stages situated right across from each other made maneuvering between acts quick and painless. Non-conflicting set times meant that festival-goers could show up just 10 minutes before their favorite artist’s set time and still get front row.</p>\n<p>Oh, and forget dodging elbows to the face and feeling packed like a sardine. The TIMF crowd actually respects personal space and the “first come, first served” rule. Of course, the occasional muscle-teed and snapback-capped gent may have tried to muscle through the crowd. However, TIMF’s infrequency of the aforementioned demographic makes this festival a walk in the park compared to the usual death match Coachella crowds can devolve into.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a San Francisco music festival without some good eats. In fact, Bay Area local Robyn Green said that her family’s goal was to “eat at every food stand here.” That is a noble goal indeed, Mrs. Green. The tea party included paella, chocolate-covered bacon, coca-cola braised pork sandwiches and acai bowls. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this delicious food was at the comedy tent where one could see Lauren Lapkus (“Orange Is the New Black” and “Jurassic World”) performing improv or Jerrod Carmichael (“Neighbors”) doing some standup. Silent Frisco’s Silent Disco party served as the best calorie burner, where hoards of people simultaneously performed interpretive dance. But now, on to the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dressed in Hawaiian shirts and shorts, Viceroy kicked off the festival with a beach party. With the support of electric fiddles, saxophones and bongos, Viceroy remixed quite a few Top 40 tracks. The crowd responded positively.</p>\n<p>Later on, Run the Jewels graced the Bridge stage with an electrifying performance. They ran out to a rendition of Queen’s “We Are the Champions,” and Killer Mike instantly let the crowd know of his intention to “burn the stage to the fucking ground.” And so they did by spewing vocal fire all over the Bridge. As if RtJ needed to win the crowd over even more, the duo sealed the deal when they took a moment to thank Steph Curry for using one of their songs in a commercial and paid their respects to the late, great Mac Dre.</p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat’s soothing sunset performance was the perfect antidote to the RtJ-induced energy. The Norwegian DJ delivered a performance with a perfect balance of dreamlike melodies and euphoric, dancy vibes that set the tone for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most anticipated performance of the weekend was the debut of Big Grams. This surprising pair, consisting of Outkast’s Big Boi and electronic duo Phantogram, was definitely a treasure at Treasure Island, or as Big Boi put it, “We come together like butt cheeks.” Big Boi even gave the crowd a treat by going back to his roots and offering up a sing-along of Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.”</p>\n<p>At this point in the night, temperatures fell quite low and the biting breeze of the bay began to leave its sting. It was appropriate then that deadmau5 was fashionably late. Twenty minutes later, just the lighting of The Dome was enough to send the audience in a frenzy, and long interludes into favorites like “Ghosts N Stuff” and “The Veldt” sustained them. Pulsing beats combined with hypnotizing visuals transported the crowd into the brilliant mind of Joel Zimmerman for 90 minutes. Deadmau5’s set was much more than a performance; it was an experience.</p>\n<p>Coming off the high that was day one, day two fell a bit flat.</p>\n<p>If day one was a dancer’s paradise, day two was a lazy Sunday afternoon in a coffee shop which, for the most part, fit the lineup. An appearance from Karl the Fog definitely added to the mood as well. As Jose Gonzalez gracefully strummed away on his guitar, attendees meditated, practiced yoga and had picnics on the lawn.</p>\n<p>Father John Misty did what most performers of the day failed to do: offer a heartfelt performance. In between poking fun at the videographers and joking about the necessity of a man bun due to the high winds, Father John Misty belted out songs so beautifully, you had to hold your “honeybear” … or wish you had one.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Deerhunter failed to elicit any emotion from the audience. Lead singer Bradford Cox even commented that “it sounds like a library out there.” However, this comment seemed like more of a dig at his own band since it takes a lot to shut a Bay Area crowd up.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Chvrches picked the pace right back up and unleashed the crowd’s full potential. Even though lead singer Lauren Mayberry apologized for the wind messing with her vocals and giving her “hairballs,” she did not miss a single note. The synth-pop trio’s charm drew one of the biggest crowds of the weekend.</p>\n<p>The National closed out this wonderful festival in style by bringing out Chvrches’ own Mayberry. She joined in on a duet of “I Need My Girl” with Matt Berninger in a live performance even better than the original. Proving that they get better with age, The National delivered a delightful performance and defended their legitimacy as a festival headliner.</p>\n<p>This festival had it all: diversity, spontaneity, you name it. With a little luck, one may even spot a few Jack Sparrows running around. And maybe, just maybe, if you wear a shark costume, deadmau5 will pull you up on stage. Anything is possible at Treasure Island.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/","id":6904,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6903,6902,6901],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Goldenvoice To Bring Sufjan Stevens to the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sujanstevendsdn102115.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sujanstevendsdn102115.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Oct. 24 The Arlington Theatre in Downtown Santa Barbara will be welcoming Sufjan Stevens to its illustrious stage.

With its plush, red velvet seats and elaborate décor transporting you to the nighttime plaza of a Spanish village, the Arlington makes the perfect venue for a show as cinematic as Stevens’.</p>\n<p>A virtuoso since a young age, Stevens can pick at a banjo, lay down tunes on a xylophone or drum set and play a wide variety of other instruments. But the Stevens seen playing live is always stationary with his trusty guitar, which he treats like an extension of his soul. It doesn’t end just there — Stevens is not your average, run-of-the-mill acoustic performer. He’s also a visionary. When attending a Sufjan Stevens concert, be prepared for a dreamy light show, Stevens himself donning a pair of wings and perhaps an endearingly kitschy costume, and an instrumental ensemble of 20, give or take.</p>\n<p>When he’s up on that stage with his adorably awkward demeanor and witty monologues, don’t let Stevens’ boyish facial features fool you — he has been a part of the indie folk music scene since his first album, <em>A Sun Came</em>, dropped in 2000. However, it was not until five years later when the Detroit, MI native garnered some well-deserved attention with his album <em>Illinois</em>, a tribute to what he believes is “the center of gravity” for the Midwest. The album, his fifth, soared to No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. NPR, Pitchfork and Amazon also named it their album of the year. His first hit single, “Chicago,” is included on the track list and Stevens continues to perform it at every concert.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since then, the artist has collaborated with The National and even accompanied them on stage to sing backing vocals on “The Late Show with David Letterman.” Under his record company Asthmatic Kitty, which he runs with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, Stevens has worked with many other blossoming artists in the indie pop/rock/hip hop landscape. And, of course, Stevens has been churning out some new records of his own, too: most notably his latest release in March, <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell.</em></p>\n<p><em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> paints a picture of Stevens’ struggle to get through his mother’s death. The album makes apparent their stressed relationship; his biological mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and was afflicted with substance abuse issues. In one of his songs on <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em>, he sings, “when I was three, three maybe four, she left us at that video store.” It’s intimate. It’s (extremely) emotional. It’s a different Sufjan Stevens from the one that wears wings on stage. But this is what makes his latest album so great — you feel like he’s singing you his diary with his worldly yet oh-so-gentle voice. Essentially, this deep connection with the audience — this gripping vulnerability that he allows on stage — is what will make this performance a shame to miss.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OkX_r032PM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Any way in which someone departed from that by being over fanciful or putting interpretations on top of the music, that was not right. Not having adequate technique to be able to carry out what you set out to do, that was not right. Well, most of us do not have that luxury. So I do not use that for a model for my teaching, but I do try to hold myself to those standards.</p>\n<p>I do have quite a number of talented graduate students, and I try to get them to see to the heart of the music and not put personal things on top of it. That’s something we all do as teenagers, but you want to grow out of that a bit. I’ve probably given them a little more rope than my teacher, I hope I am a bit nicer. I’ve certainly learned patience over the years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> You also have recorded all of the major works of Schubert’s on piano, a project you began in 1984. Your two most recent recordings and all earlier volumes will be re-issued very soon as The Complete Major Piano Works of Schubert. How does it feel to complete this immense project?</p>\n<p><em>PB: </em>You don’t usually get this opportunity, usually they want you to fill a particular hole of some obscure composer who has never been recorded before, but a record company approached me backstage at a concert in London in 1983 and they said, “We’d like to record you, what would you like to record?” I grabbed the opportunity, and I wanted to do the last three Schubert piano sonatas.</p>\n<p>I grew up with Schubert. His sonatas were not part of the standard repertoire. I now feel I was very fortunate to come upon the pieces in books of music sitting on other people’s pianos. I didn’t have clear models for these [sonatas] but it allowed me to develop my own thoughts and feelings about them. As time went on, I went back to doing more of the those, and I think by the late 90s I had finished all of his completed sonatas.</p>\n<p>It always concerned me in the back of my mind that there were other works of Schubert’s I had not done. So I went back to do the impromptus, and then I realized, well, there are only a few more works of Schubert I hadn’t recorded.</p>\n<p>We have to keep renaming this series, now it’ll have to say, speaking very carefully, The Complete Major Piano Works of Schubert. And I think this is it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> DN:</em> At your recital on October 23<sup>rd</sup> you will be playing <em>33 Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli</em>, Op 120. What made you want to take on this difficult task and what can people look forward to?</p>\n<p><em>PB</em>: Beethoven is a very great composer. We’re always in the shadow of those who came before us. There is something very unique about Beethoven that you don’t get very often. These surprises and shocks that he puts in [his work]. With any other composer you can pretty much guess whether it is to be loud or soft, never with Beethoven. It’s not entirely to be shocking, it’s really in service of a greater whole.</p>\n<p>It’s always a bit daunting taking on Beethoven, and I’ve never done this. Partly because it’s such a huge work and a very large undertaking, partly because its very difficult to get familiar with it. I have only heard it performed live twice in my life.</p>\n<p>Aside from a few variations, it’s actually a very joyful piece and it has a great sense of humor. A few of them are actually funny. There’s a wealth of energy that we sort of forgot its there. Well, it shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>I do feel that it can be a little bit daunting for the audience because there’s no repetition between variations like in the big sonata pieces. It’s never familiar. It’s the most adventurous piece Beethoven, or just about anybody, has ever written, I think. Most of the variations are wildly contrasting, and he starts going very far afield with the different harmonies.</p>\n<p>It is such a large-scale work, almost an hour. People have played a first half, taken an intermission and then played the second half. I thought, that might be too much on an audience, why not just present the work itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Do you have any words of wisdom for somebody who would like a career in music like yours?</p>\n<p><em>PB:</em> It’s very hard. There are lots of talented people around, and even those who devote themselves fully to the music and are very deserving, there’s very few opportunities. There’s so much luck and good fortune as well as accomplishment involved.</p>\n<p>But if you can’t imagine doing anything else, if you feel like you have to do it, well those are the people that should be doing it. Even then, you have to be realistic.</p>\n<p>There’s no point being blind and saying, “Just follow your desires,” because you have to be ready for disappointment. But if you hold steady, and are very devoted you should get some opportunity along the way.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65568\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65568\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/","id":6901,"author":{"id":731,"name":"Jordan Metz"},"related":[6900,6899,6898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Janet Jackson to Bring ‘Unbreakable’ to SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/janet-jackson-2009-mary-ellen-matthews-billboard-650.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/janet-jackson-2009-mary-ellen-matthews-billboard-650.jpg?resize=650%2C430&ssl=1","description":"The remote was clutched in my hands and my eyes were plastered to the TV screen decorated with Janet Jackson slithering all over the floor in the “Pleasure Principle” video.

In the 6<sup>th</sup> grade, she was my muse for “Decades Day,” my outfit was missing more than kneepads and shaggy hair, I was in need of that effortless 1980s Janet Jackson cool. With the remote as a microphone and the empty living room as an auditorium, I attempted every shoulder bounce, leg kick and high note unaware of its release 10 years prior to my birth. Making her solo debut in 1982, Janet Jackson’s career stood the test of time and paved the way for Ciara’s jaw-dropping choreography, Rihanna’s bad girl attitude and Aaliyah’s effortless sex appeal.</p>\n<p>Three decades into her iconic career, Janet Jackson is gearing up to take fans breath away, yet again, with her Unbreakable World Tour. Ms. Jackson’s tour sails into Santa Barbara not once but twice for October 21<sup>st</sup> and October 22<sup>nd</sup> at the Santa Barbara Bowl.</p>\n<p>Having dropped her self-titled debut album at the tender age of 16 years old, who could have guessed the doe-eyed beauty would be releasing her 11<sup>th</sup> album. On October 2<sup>nd</sup>, Jackson released “Unbreakable,” the album to accompany her world tour. Having already released the lead single “No Sleep,” with a mesmerizing verse from J Cole, Jackson kicked off the 36-leg tour in Vancouver on August 1<sup>st</sup>. Following the announcement of her tour, LiveNation reported 88% of the tickets sold out in the first two weeks. But have no fear, tickets to see the Rhythm Nation songstress at the Santa Barbara Bowl remain, ranging from $64 to $135. Do not hesitate, it is not the show to miss.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although Janet’s influence is seen in artists new and old, the Unbreakable World Tour serves as a reminder that there is only one Janet Damita Jo Jackson. If Santa Barbara residents cannot predict anything else, they can expect nonstop dancing and nonstop Janet. The five-time Grammy award recipient is said to perform a whopping 32 songs including “Pleasure Principle,” “When I Think of You,” and “Scream” with her brother, the late Michael Jackson. Jackson makes every concertgoers’ dream come true with no opener. With an archive of music large enough to perform a different set every night, an hour and a half of only Janet Jackson is all that fans could wish for. A far cry from the sensuality that has characterized her career, Jackson will take on Santa Barbara in sneakers and baggy pants fit for her complex and unbeatable choreography.</p>\n<p>Having quality music across three decades is sure to flood the Santa Barbara Bowl with die-hard Janet fans of all ages. To freshen up on your Janet lyrics, her lengthy list of hit albums can be found on iTunes including the newly released “Unbreakable.” To witness the veteran’s show, remaining tickets can be found on LiveNation.com.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65553\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/janet-jackson-to-bring-unbreakable-to-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65553\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/janet-jackson-to-bring-unbreakable-to-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/janet-jackson-to-bring-unbreakable-to-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/janet-jackson-to-bring-unbreakable-to-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/janet-jackson-to-bring-unbreakable-to-sb-bowl/","id":6900,"author":{"id":719,"name":"Nisa Smith"},"related":[6899,6898,6897],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Twelve Songs that Sound Like a Pumpkin Spice Latte","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150818-pumpkin-spice-starbucks_519fa3f07a5db156f84e5f8a1b22bda9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150818-pumpkin-spice-starbucks_519fa3f07a5db156f84e5f8a1b22bda9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For lots of you, it may be hard to believe that it’s officially fall.

The first line of the song illustrates “bones sinking like stones.” HALLOWEEN, anyone?</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWeuUwpEQfs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>“September” by the The Shins</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s not quite September anymore, but that’s just the title (not once does the song actually mention the month).

Little did he know, the record became a smash hit across the country, landing the singer his first Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. The commercially successful record reached top of the charts on top 40 radio stations in countries in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, etc.</p>\n<p>Hozier, whose real name is Andrew Hozier-Byrne, was born in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. He began studying music in college, went on to sing in a travelling chorale ensemble, and finally got his big break by recoding demos for the studio heads at Universal Music. He then released his first EP with the same title of his now-famous record, with that title track and four more songs. The EP became a sensation on the Internet, going viral on YouTube and music streaming sites such as SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 14, 2014, Hozier released the full studio album, eponymously titled, to massive critical and commercial success. Singles from the album beside the most well-known song include “Work Song” and “Someone New,” which speaks of aspirations and failed relationships. The main allure behind Hozier’s record is not only that it is relatable (he could be the new male version of Taylor Swift. Goodbye, John Mayer), but it is also honest and real to human emotions.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lucky enough for Hozier fans in 805 areas and surrounding counties, the songwriter is coming to the Santa Barbara Bowl for a special concert performance on his worldwide tour.
