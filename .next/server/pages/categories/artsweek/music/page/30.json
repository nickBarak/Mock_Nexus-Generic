Watkins was seated on a raised podium center-stage while the other members stood on their feet throughout the night, allowing animated movements.</p>\n<p>Named after celebrated writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emerson String Quartet boasts a high stature in the world of strings as they’ve debuted at Carnegie Hall, recorded several best-selling Classical music albums and booked to perform at the Conservatoire de Musique of Geneva, Switzerland.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The quartet’s first selection of the night was none other than Mozart’s String Quartet in G Major, K. 387. A classical piece for a quartet’s performance, this selection featured contrasts of loud and soft segments, which kept the audience engaged throughout. Unlike many selections of the time, this piece conveyed a sense of unity by achieving a musical conversation between the string players.</p>\n<p>Emerson String Quartet seemed to have conveyed that sense of unity well, as classical-music admirer Alice Lee applauded their synchronization abilities. “I was extremely impressed by their togetherness. That really defines a string quartet, you know, whether or not they speak to each other through their instruments,” Lee said in an interview after the show with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>The audience favorite of the night was Ravel’s String Quartet in F Major, a pleasant deviation from the norm of classical string quartet selections. The song allowed the first violinist, Philip Setzer, to share a warming melody with the audience. Then, the second violinist and violist played in synchrony as the piece led up to its climax.</p>\n<p>Pre-Biology major, music minor and bass player Ian Hay vouched for the audience’s opinion. “Ravel is a really interesting piece. It has a lot of emotion to it and lots of different dynamics and contrast. It just really appealed to me on an emotional level,” Hay said. Their performance for this selection earned a roaring standing ovation and murmurs of compliments throughout the crowd.</p>\n<p>Emerson String Quartet’s final selection was Beethoven’s Quartet in E-flat Major, Op. 127, a faster, finale-appropriate piece. Based off of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, this piece featured darker-sounding chords and a more dramatic harmony. The group accentuated the melodrama through their slight pops, sways and leans.</p>\n<p>Hay also mentioned the impressiveness of the group’s harmony. “I’ve seen lots of quartets and lots of orchestras. It seems that [Emerson String Quartet] has a lot of dynamic together,” Hay said. “You can tell that they’re communicating with each other through the course of the piece and they seem to be following each other really well. I think that’s a really nice thing to see because a lot of the time you’ll see [a quartet] almost sterile up there.”</p>\n<p>Following a few rounds of roaring applause and standing ovations, the quartet gifted an encore. Violinist Eugene Drucker informed the audience that the group had chosen Mozart’s unfinished “Fantasia,” composed on June 22, 1680. An audible gasp rippled through the crowd as Drucker introduced the piece’s origins.</p>\n<p>The four added personality to these classical pieces, appropriately flavoring a night of pure classical music; and, with a purposefully simplistic stage of black and white tones, the audience was able to better understand beauty not with the eyes but with the ears.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60718\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60718\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/","id":7007,"author":{"id":750,"name":"Sophie Ho"},"related":[7006,7005,7004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"RL Grime Creates Turbulence at Sold-Out Velvet Jones Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=479%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Squeezing my way into a crowd of sweaty college students and post-adolescents, I was captivated by the tall silhouette that appeared on the stage of the completely sold-out Velvet Jones.

With people staggered from wall to wall without an inch of space left, all eyes were fixated on the figure that stood before us. A flickering hue of purple shined onstage, outlining a crooked snapback and slim physique. With the music slowly rising in volume and the audience bustling with an intense roar of excitement, the artist grabbed the mic and declared “I go by the name of RL Grime. Santa Barbara let me see those hands!” The bass dropped.</p>\n<p>24-year-old Henry Steinway, otherwise known by his stage name, RL Grime, is a popular electronic artist and producer from Los Angeles, CA. Famous for his addictive mixture of both electronic dance music and hip hop-sampled trap, RL Grime is a favored artist in the EDM-infatuated culture of our generation. So it’s no surprise that the entirety of his nationwide Void Tour, which kicked off in October, has been a major success. Santa Barbara welcomed him with open arms this past Thursday, Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>RL Grime is part of WeDidIt Collective, which includes artists such as Shlohmo and Ryan Hemsworth. His entrancing original tunes and stimulating remixes have gotten millions of plays on SoundCloud. The list includes originals such as “Tell Me” and “Core” and remixes of Big Sean’s “Kingpin” and Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa.” His 2008 EP <em>High Beams</em> debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic chart and at No. 8 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. <em>Void</em>, his 2014 debut studio album, is just another step towards the artist’s growing world of electronic possibilities. It seems that no matter how the L.A. native chooses to demonstrate his musical talents, his devoted fan base continues to expand.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Presented by REDEYE and EPIC events, Velvet Jones became the destination for hundreds of EDM lovers. Tommy Kruise and Lunice warmed up the venue with their refreshing hip hop remixes, pumping up everyone for the sold-out night. When RL Grime finally hit the stage, college students who were otherwise stressed with papers and midterms filled with nothing but happiness and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>The young artist remained stationed behind his elevated podium, giving off a mysterious vibe throughout the set. The lighting primarily came from behind, casting a dark shadow over him to set off the vibrant shades of red, green and purple. In rare moments, a light shined directly onto RL Grime, exposing his zealous expression and intriguing appearance. In front of his wide podium was the shape of a gravestone — the iconic symbol of the WeDidIt collective.</p>\n<p>“Scylla,” a <em>Void </em>favorite, opened the set. Instead of easing the crowd into some of his more regularly rhythm beats, RL Grime jumped right into the good stuff — the type of “good stuff” that everyone came to see him for. “Scylla” was perfect for this, stunning the audience with enrapturing beats and base drops that cast a rebellious spell over everyone. Its lower-toned attributes and fast-paced theme created a turbulent atmosphere which translated into a vicious monster-fighting scene in a film. Velvet Jones exploded with pandemonium.</p>\n<p>RL Grime continued to bless the crowd with mind-blowing bass drops, hip hop snippets and trap vibrations. Songs such as “Core” and “Heard Me” set the venue on fire. People began crowd-surfing and standing on the ledges along the edges of Velvet Jones, and the intensity of the bass shaking the walls increased everyone’s fervor. Remixes of Beyonce’s “711,” YG’s “My Ni**a,” Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” and TNGHT’s “Acrylics” created extreme devoutness to the music. RL Grime truly has a way of making an audience feel invincible.</p>\n<p>With a set that lasted over an hour and a half, RL Grime did not let his devotees down for a single second. Towards the end, he came out from behind his podium and made his way to the front of the stage, announcing that he had one more song in store before the end of the night. As he made his way back behind the podium, the beginning of “Tell Me” started playing and everyone knew that the best part of the night was about to happen. As the music built up and the bass was about to drop, RL Grime counted down from three and Velvet Jones erupted one last time. He added in an interesting remix of the tune before once again playing the beloved and well-known drop for which the L.A. native is known. As I headed home, the strong melody still rang in my ears.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60640\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60640\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/","id":7005,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7004,7003,7002],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LOUDPVCK turns Earl Warren into a Trap House for One Night","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mobile-747a0021eb349e9c.jpg?resize=320%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mobile-747a0021eb349e9c.jpg?resize=320%2C494&ssl=1","description":"A hooded woman clad from head to toe in jet black “ǂ₩0ИK” gear stood in stark contrast against the perspiring orange walls of the bathroom hallway.

Her bandana bounced onto the oversized hoodie with each hum of bass. A person in a T-Rex costume nearly shoulder-checked a shirtless python-armed man, skipping his way back to the dance floor. On Saturday, Jan. 31, this smorgasbord of unlikely companions gathered at Earl Warren Showgrounds for one reason — the all-star DJ cast of Zimmer, AC Slater, Djemba Djemba and, of course, LOUDPVCK.</p>\n<p>Zimmer’s set was a good introduction to Saturday’s theme: Play a little something for everyone. Down-tempo grungy was the icebreaker as the French DJ began the long and grueling process of warming a crowd of standers.</p>\n<p>As people trickled in one-by-one, the groove deviated from its original trajectory. Low bass hums gradually sharpened into intermittent synth stabs. Swaying began in the crowd, and cross-armed fraternity brothers tapped their feet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Zimmer’s tropical remix of “Don’t Wanna Dance” echoed throughout the dome, as hip shakes possessed the small crowd of a few hundred.</p>\n<p>Felix Dechant, longtime Zimmer fan, concluded that Zimmer’s set was a very traditional deep European set that didn’t really fit into the theme of the of the entire show. However, he went on to say that the set was very artfully crafted and performed its job of loosening the crowd.</p>\n<p>Next on the menu was AC Slater. The Dim Mak DJ’s set was the closest thing to a club mix that evening and transformed the crowd entirely. Audience members were jumping and fist pumping to the guttural tribal sounds of Slater. “Woo’s” and chants could be heard over each layer of white noise.</p>\n<p>While the crowd was visibly more energetic, Slater’s performance was largely unchanging with the occasional sprinkling of crowd-pleasing tracks like CoCo.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Swanson, or Djemba Djemba as his diehard fans know him, spun the most versatile tracks of the evening. Swanson mixed everything from future bass to traditional trap to deep house to straight hip hop. Unfortunately, the track selection was slightly lower energy than the hard-to-please crowd needed. While there was a certain degree of moshing for hits such as “NRG” and RL Grime’s “Core,” in general the crowd was largely stationary, probably in anticipation of more big room house music.</p>\n<p>Katelyn Carano, a hoop dancer hired for the event, offered an explanation for the lackluster prestige of electronic music performances in Santa Barbara. Carano implied that there is a much smaller scene of electronic music fans in SB than in other metropolitan cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles. As a result, Santa Barbara shows are usually comprised of partiers who have never heard of the acts, avid festival goers, traditional Kandi-wearing ravers and spiritual types that run the local transformative festival, Lucidity. As a result, DJs experience issues tailoring their sets to such a diverse audience.</p>\n<p>However, nobody overcame this obstacle better than LOUDPVCK. The “Kill Bill” fight theme song blared through speakers as the silhouettes of Kenny Beats and Ryan Marks became visible behind the DJ stand.</p>\n<p>After ten minutes of the loudest festival trap of the evening, Marks grabbed the mic and shouted, “That was the warm-up round!” The crowd danced with ferocity as PVCK dropped one festival standard after another.</p>\n<p>To charge up the visibly tiring crowd, Marks put his lips to the microphone once again. “Who’s a ’90s baby out there?” he shouted. Dancers erupted as “California Love” bumped over the speakers followed by “Still D.R.E.” and “Big Poppa.”</p>\n<p>“I graduated from Santa Barbara High School,” Marks said into the mic, a few minutes before the end of the show. The statement mustered the last ounce of energy remaining in the depleted showgrounds.</p>\n<p>Ending with their latest Dada Life remix, LOUDPVCK said their thanks to a roaring crowd.

Music Club before being joined by the night’s main performers, The Dirty Knobs.</p>\n<p>Known for hits such as “Born to Be Wild” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” Steppenwolf achieved worldwide recognition in the late 1960s before breaking up in 1972 and then on-and-off reuniting through the years. Although he often performs with a backing band, John Kay, a Santa Barbara resident, is now the only original member of the group.</p>\n<p>Kay opened the night solo, playing blues songs from his “rambling days” before Steppenwolf. Using his instantly recognizable slide guitar style and switching between acoustic and steel guitars, the musician told stories from his life to provide context for each song. During this set, the general admission audience crowded together near the doorway to see from behind those still eating dinner in front of the stage. SOhO staff also maintained a no-talking policy, but that did not stop some of the more enthusiastic audience members from yelling the occasional “You rock, John Kay!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Any ability to enforce the rule went out the window when The Dirty Knobs walked onstage and joined in midway through “The Pusher,” turning the quiet, but passionate song into a booming, energetic spectacle. Using every inch of space available to them, the crowd danced, shouted and sang along with whatever words they knew. Kay proceeded with “Sookie Sookie” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” ending with a long, aggressive performance of “Born to Be Wild.” He somehow preserved all the roughness and energy of the original recording with some to spare.</p>\n<p>After staff cleared the tables and perfected sound levels, The Dirty Knobs returned sans Kay with their own set list to carry out the night. The Knobs, regulars of SOhO, are generally considered a side project of Mike Campbell, lead guitarist for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. But on Friday, the band was also joined by Ron Blair (who replaced regular bassist Lance “Crawdaddy” Morrison currently on tour with Don Henley) and keyboardist Benmont Tench, both original members of The Heartbreaker.</p>\n<p>On Tench’s inclusion, Campbell said he was eager to play with Kay, but did not realize until after he took the gig that they would need a keyboardist. “You can’t play Steppenwolf without that fucking organ. And there’s only one guy I know up to the challenge,” Campbell said.</p>\n<p>The band performed an eclectic list of cover songs, from Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates’ frequently covered “Shakin’ All Over” to The Kinks’ relatively unknown “Apeman.” Seventy-nine on <em>Rolling Stones’</em> 100 Greatest Guitarists list, Campbell proved that legendary guitarists can afford to be generous, and made a point to give every band member a chance in the spotlight. At one point, he invited the group’s roadie, known simply as Chinner, to play lead guitar on a song.</p>\n<p>In addition to improv solos from Blair and Tench, rhythm guitarist Jason “Ape” Sinay traded lead parts with Campbell, and drummer Matt “Swampfox” Laug played complicated fills, while Campbell frequently directed the crowd’s attention to him as if a proud mother. With the exception of Tench, every band member also sang on at least one song.</p>\n<p>By the end of their set list, the audience was chanting “Dirty Knobs” until the band reemerged for their own rendition of the Jimi-Hendrix-popularized “Hey Joe” with an intro featuring segments of “1983.” Their extended, over-driven and no-holds-barred version of the song put the members’ true skill and cohesion on display. Campbell demonstrated much of the speed, agility and overall guitar mastery of Hendrix, with fewer of the show-off-y riffs.</p>\n<p>As the crowd thinned out, the members walked around the club, speaking with fans and posing for pictures. Laug said the night exceeded his expectations, and that playing with other artists is his favorite aspect of performing live.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was one of the better gigs ever. It was amazing,” he said. “We don’t get that much [interaction between live musicians] these days. Because of the technology, everybody can do everything on the computer by themselves. It’s nowhere near human interaction.”</p>\n<p>He explained that the band only met John Kay for the first time shortly before the show, and that it only took a few minutes to prepare.</p>\n<p>“You know, the songs are radio staples, you hear ‘em everyday almost,” Laug said. “I listen to the radio, I think I know how it goes; just get up there and rock it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/","id":7004,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[7003,7002,7001],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Patti Smith Plays Explosive Show at the Granada Godmother of Punk Rock Sells Out Arts & Lectures Gig","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting at the edge of the Granada theater stage, the godmother of punk rock shook her silver hair out before jumping down, landing with a feathery thud into the thin carpet.

A collective gasp came from 272 audience members sitting in the front section who held their breath as she moved past them, dancing and clapping for her band onstage. Humble as ever, she tried to make herself a member of the crowd, giving her beloved guitarist of over 25 years Lenny Kaye time to shine. But it didn’t work. All eyes were on the otherworldly woman roaming through the aisles: Patti Smith.</p>\n<p>Sexy, expressive and constantly in motion, Smith and her band played a 15-song set as part of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures winter season. Wearing jeans that bagged around the knees and her signature menswear blazer, Smith bent gender roles through her feisty cool girl stage presence. Described by the late rock critic Lester Bangs in 1976 as a “badass who pulls off the feat of being simultaneously idol of women and lust object of men,” the 68-year-old rocker continued to bring the badassery.</p>\n<p>In between verses of “Ain’t It Strange,” she sprayed saliva over her right shoulder, nearly hitting her bassist, Tony Shanahan, standing four feet away. During the heavier songs, Smith prowled around the stage like an animal, letting Kaye’s explosive guitar riffs pulsate throughout her body. At one point there was so much fierce tension onstage between singer and guitarist that a fire seemed to erupt from their knees, as they kept bending back and forth towards each other in a frenzy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At other times, Smith displayed a feminine flirtiness. During “Pumping (My Heart),” she climbed towards the drum kit, playfully waving her body in front of drummer of 40 years Jay Dee Daugherty. Her dancing ranged from the feistiness of an angsty teenage boy to the slow, fleshy movements of a woman seducing her lover. “She danced as if she was a 50s back up dancer with an up-do and a miniskirt, and it honestly made me want to take my clothes off,” said fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who paused a second before adding, “I think I’m in love with a woman.”</p>\n<p>While she undoubtedly had enormous sex appeal, Smith also exuded a mother-like warmth throughout the venue. Gracious and humble, she never tried to out-do her band. Instead, she showed support and love, visibly encouraging them to jam harder and slipping into the audience and the side of the stage to observe the whole scene.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just the band that felt the warmth; the whole of Granada felt the golden honey cover their bodies and melt away the stresses of tomorrow. Her love for her fans was evident when she trotted through the aisles, holding hands of people who reached for her and receiving hugs and kisses with a smile.</p>\n<p>Linda Benet, a faculty member of SBCC, saw Smith at festivals in the mid-70s, but Tuesday’s show was the first time she saw the rocker perform on a solo bill. “Patti is someone many, many of us seem to trust to take into our psyches perhaps ’cause of her honesty and rawness combined with love,” Benet said.</p>\n<p>This idea of trust resonates especially with those who work closely with Smith. “Her love goes to all people, all people around the world [who] she helps. Patti never had enough food when she was growing up, she never had a toy … she slept in streets. These experiences made her warm,” said Yuki Burns, Smith’s personal assistant, in a conversation after the show. A peppy Japanese lady, Burns has worked with Smith for over 15 years, and handed out prized set lists in Smith’s handwriting to anyone who wanted it.</p>\n<p>Another thing about the lady rocker is that she’s got no shortage of wit. During an improvised rendition of “My Blakean Year,” she stopped the poetry on a line about Ethel Barrymore to rant about John Barrymore being a black sheep and how humans give pigs a bad name. A natural performer, she maintained a lively conversation with the audience throughout the entire show. “Wing!” a man in row Y shouted, referencing a song from <em>Gone Again</em>. “Oh we’re not doing that one,” she answered, but then went into a cappella on the chorus. It was rough around the edges, but her spirit was there and claps ensued afterward. “Sang a little flat, but it was for him, so,” she winked towards the back row.</p>\n<p>Songs were sung in memory of Amy Winehouse, Monty Brown and Fred “Sonic” Smith, the last of whom is her late husband. “I wrote the words of this song for my boyfriend in 1978 … He became my husband, the father of my children and though he is departed, we think of him always. When I sing the words of this song, it is as if it were the first time,” she said, slowing her voice to annunciate “first” and “time” as separate units. “Because the Night” followed this sweet introduction.</p>\n<p>A second tender moment came when she told the story of how The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun” was the first song she hit all the notes to when she was 16. “Eric Burdon and the Animals … were for us, they were for the disenfranchised, the mavericks, the black sheep, maybe they were for John Barrymore. I say this because tonight we all got to meet Eric and I didn’t get to express this little story to him … I am singing today because I hit all the notes.”</p>\n<p>But the best part of the night came when Smith began the poetry of “Gandhi.” Pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose and reading off two sheets of paper stapled together, she started off slow, so slow one could’ve been lulled to sleep.</p>\n<p>Then came the thunder, the firepower that gets unleashed when Smith gets in the groove. Over the course of eight minutes, she threw the paper down, shoved her glasses into the blazer, spat over her shoulder three times and knocked over the mic stand twice. The song pulled and pulsed, the build moving gradually until all of Granada was about to explode with a carnal euphoria.</p>\n<p>In a moment that went unnoticed by the frontwoman, a man sitting in row P behind a couple sharing binoculars smiled to himself. “Nobody does a build like Patti Smith,” he announced out loud. “Nobody.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

In late 2013, as the ever-fickle electronic music scene left the iconic sound of the dirty south behind in favor of an obnoxious monotony of Big Room House synths, the PVCK remained tried and true to their hip-hop roots.</p>\n<p>While their latest releases feature far more sophisticated layering than early hits like “NV$TY” and “DIP’N IT,” the soul of gangster rap which built their fan base is still brimming in tracks like their A$AP Rocky bootleg. Also, if having a featured set on the radio show “Sway in the Morning” doesn’t certify these guys’s authenticity as hip-hop souls, little else can.</p>\n<p>Also on the bill for Saturday is underdog producer prodigy Djemba Djemba. It’s hard to know what to make of this kid. Andrew Swanson, as his parents know him, is a camera-shy enigma, a rarity in EDM culture where it seems the newest sound is as important as the most fashionable haircut.</p>\n<p>Swanson’s social media is littered with psychedelic paintings of jungle cats and sideways photos of him hunching his shoulders in playfully awkward poses. But don’t let that fool you — this guy is no slouch. He has served as the primary audio engineer for several of the biggest names in the industry, most notably Diplo.</p>\n<p>Swanson is a producer of phenomenal talent whose reach extends beyond his solo project. His name pops on just about everything from track credits on “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” soundtrack to Chris Brown’s latest solo album, <em>X</em>.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with his Boiler Room set will know the DJ disdains being encapsulated by one genre of music. For a prediction of the nature of his set on Saturday, check out his SoundCloud feed. True to his versatile tastes, Swanson’s SoundCloud is comprised almost exclusively of the latest and greatest in electronic music by artists you’ve never heard of.</p>\n<p>Next up, AC Slater of Dim Mak fame needs no grand introduction. He was a pioneer for heavy bass, going one deeper before it was cool. The Tchami signature bass wobbles that now fill main stages across the world owe Slater a kiss on the cheek for paving the way over four years ago.</p>\n<p>But don’t expect fist pumping and jumping during AC Slater. His will be a slower, tempo hip-swaying clubby set, a welcome refresher to counterbalance the headlining act.</p>\n<p>So here’s the bottom line. This show is not for: people who get nervous in crowds, people who say drum machines don’t have a soul and people who don’t like hip hop. This show <em>is</em> for: people who love hip-hop, people who crave the unexpected (Djemba Djemba is one of the most unpredictable live musicians in the industry) and people who realize that <em>usually</em> it’s $30 to see any single one of the four artists on the bill individually.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe

across America, the city south of Los Angeles comes alive once again on the stereo with Vince Staples’ new EP, <em>Hell Can Wait</em>. Staples is an artist with a street cred as long as his list of collaborations with artists like Odd Future and Mac Miller. In his new album, the seasoned rapper tells a disarmingly honest and uncomfortably up-front story that takes the listener by the hand through the streets of Long Beach. Never overwhelmingly edgy nor depressingly pessimistic, <em>Hell Can Wait </em>has Staples echoing “Hope I outlive them red roses,” a lyrical sign of the artist’s morning star peeking over the proverbial Long Beach horizon.</p>\n<p>Though the album is only half an hour long, don’t mistake brevity for lack of depth and versatility. The rapper offers his thoughts on everything from gangbanging to police brutality from his own experiences in a coherent, rational fashion. Never hurried, the lyrics come from a deeply rooted place that he offers as soul food to his audience.</p>\n<p>In “65 Hunnid,” Staples reflects on his days gangbanging, reminiscing “You alone / Car full of n*ggas but you alone / It’s time to show how much you love your homies.” Juxtaposing sex and gangbanging, Staples shows that his story isn’t the typical, “get money mo’ money” stories saturating the gangster rap industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rather, his tales are told in the “still-life” moments of hustling, the day-to-day moments of living on the streets. In a recent interview with <em>Pitchfork</em>, Staples compares music to being “in the zoo, and the listeners are the people outside of the cage … you’re not going to step inside that glass, because you know what’ll happen to you. [But] Rappers are making this shit a petting zoo.” Whether that’s a verdict on the rap industry as a whole or Staples offering his thoughts on his song-writing process is up for interpretation.</p>\n<p>A lack of glorification of gang culture is a defining aspect of <em>Hell Can Wait</em>. Staples’ constant themes about the Dickensian aspect of the street-life, from selling drugs to riding with his homies, solidifies his credo as one of the most genuine rappers today. In “Screen Door,” he explores his past living with his drug-dealing father and working-class mother, ranting, “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG / this ain’t no movie, bro.” Laid over an unobtrusive beat and instrumental, Staples chants, “Who’s that peekin’ in my screen door” in between verses of his father’s evolution from drug-dealing to more criminal activities. In a previous mixtape, Staples meditates on his father’s crime, rapping, “Dad did time ‘cause he sold drugs for me / I could never judge a man trying to better off his fam.” Though weak on raw emotion, “Screen Door” is prototypical of the whole album, touching on everything from his mother’s teenage pregnancy, his father’s drug fiasco and his own burning passion for money and respect on the streets.</p>\n<p>And, what’s a ghetto gospel going to be without mention of the police? In “Hands Up,” Staples’ ire against the police and school district comes alive, as he rants, “LAPD, they ain’t ‘bout shit.” His lyrics takes on a caustic quality. Criticizing the police’s use of excessive force, Staples’ lyrics are reminiscent of recent events in Ferguson and reference America’s failed war on crime. Echoing fellow artist Run the Jewels, Staples sardonically reflects, “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around.” According to Staples, Orwellian state oppression has held him down long enough and his lyrics burst with that tension.</p>\n<p>Staples’ future is undoubtedly going to be full of success. Judging from his prolific nature in the past two years, fans probably won’t have to wait too long for another taste. <em>Hell Can Wait </em>is only a freshman EP and Staples is no doubt working on his next album, a prospect that both excites and terrifies this reviewer. Staples’ development over the years shows that his mentors have taught him many useful technical tricks that will prove critically important as he gains more attention in the hip hop community. He has already achieved much by signing on to Def Jam Records. Now all he needs to do is prove that he earned it, a definite struggle in the works.</p>\n<p>Hip hop has always been a trinity between dance, rap and graffiti, the whole being greater than the sum of all three. It has also always been an identity of the oppressed, of the powerless. But as hip hop became more mainstream over the last decade, the community has been more and more marginalized.</p>\n<p>One instance of this was <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s suggestion that the much-maligned rapper Iggy Azalea ‘ran hip hop,’ which drew much criticism of readers and forced the magazine to alter the title of the article. And, even though <em>Forbes</em> is a business magazine that has no relevance in music reporting, the response is symptomatic of a larger disconnect between the mainstream, deridingly-labeled “sell-outs” and their moderate hip hop fans, and the less-well-known underground rappers and their hardcore hip hop fans.</p>\n<p>As Vince Staples walks across the tightrope of success, he must listen to both these groups and his instincts as an artist. There isn’t a <em>Dummy’s Guide to Success as a Hip Hop Artist</em>. He needs to stay relevant in an industry ruled by dance music. But he also needs to stay genuine and true to his art. Whatever he’s going to choose, only time will tell. But, as for right now, <em>Hell Can Wait</em> is a true hip hop album, a fine anthology of life on the streets by a man who lived on the streets.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJLfCBBcZAo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/","id":7732,"author":{"id":753,"name":"Jon Choi"},"related":[7731,7730,7729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper and Comes Back to Tell Us What It’s Taught Him","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/81ccb02b.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/81ccb02b.jpeg?resize=648%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Through his extensive solo work and his group Animal Collective, Noah Lennox, AKA Panda Bear, has already established himself in the music world.

As an artist he has nothing to prove anymore, and in creating his fifth full-length solo album, <em>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, </em>he is seemingly able to fully channel this into releasing a product completely reminiscent of his own style and tastes—not that he’s ever really felt the need to conform in his music—and it shows.</p>\n<p><em>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper </em>plays like an ongoing mental trip, the thirteen individual songs play together fluidly yet the album changes and shifts its style slightly with each song’s individual energy. Still the whole thing maintains a consistent feel brought on by distorted unintelligible vocals that somehow come together to create a warped psychedelic dream sequence.</p>\n<p>“Sequential Circuits” opens the record, inciting curiosity and luring the listener in for more with its foreboding seductiveness. The next song, “Mr. Noah” may be the most unique as well as catchy on the album. It begins with a slow build and a dog’s distant whining before infusing a drum and beat. It’s easy to lose oneself in the song, especially since the words come off as mostly syncopated vowel sounds. Still, it’s hard not to try to emulate them with your own strange sounds and break into expressive dance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Another definite high point on the album is reached by the fourth song, “Crosswords.” This song almost evokes a feeling of nostalgia from an unknown memory. If there were a memory associated with this song though, it would be drunkenly slow dancing in a tropical beachside nightclub as Lennox repeats “you got it good, so good…” This continues with a steadier, faster more rhythmic beat in “Butcher Baker Candlestick Maker” and the slow tropical psychedelic vibe is again revisited in “Come To Your Senses” later in the album.</p>\n<p>As far as lyrics and song meanings go, “Boys Latin” may be the most hopeful to try and read, and that’s with the help of an exceptionally abstract music video. Words like “Beasts don’t have a second to think// But we don’t appreciate our things// Dark Cloud descended again” probably references the simplicity of the survival focused “beast” mentality, compared with that of “we” humans who are constantly conscious and ruminating. This coupled with the beautifully trippy video that depicts a man engaging with nature and blurring this binary by slowly morphing into nature-beast nonhuman figure form a mild spiritual enlightenment.</p>\n<p>By the eighth song “Tropic of Cancer” it is almost although a second chapter of the album has begun. Like it has broken through the funky chaos of the first half and resurfaced into a mellow serene Eden. “Lonely Wanderer” officially welcomes the listener to this new land, allowing them to drift away into a childlike state of wondering, or wandering. This new land is fully manifested in “Principe Real” whose underlying marching chant almost seems like a nod to MGMT’s early album <em>Oracular Spectacular. </em></p>\n<p>The album unfortunately must end and does so with “Acid Wash,” which would have been an appropriate name for the entire record. The song sings almost like a congratulatory finale, for what remains unknown. Perhaps for completing the introspective journey the album takes you, and coming out more sensitive and perceptive in its wake. This doesn’t seem too unlikely with lyrics like “You’ve won against the deep// Laugh, the chasm.”</p>\n<p>Although the album’s lyrics are relatively hard to decipher and highly abstract, there is obviously deep relatable meaning left to be interpreted by the listener. To further digest the album looking up the lyrics is highly suggested and almost allows listeners to listen again for the first time with new knowledge and perspective.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/prBaZzYmQrI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/","id":7729,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[7728,7727,7726],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain Delights Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ukulele-Orchestra-Image.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ukulele-Orchestra-Image.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  Back for a second performance, The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain dazzled the Campbell Hall stage on Jan. 20 as part of the UCSB Arts & Lectures winter season.

The origins of this orchestra are interesting. Tired of the conventions of the music business, the founders created the group in 1985 based on the strange idea of an orchestra consisting of ukuleles of different sizes. Thirty years later, this strange idea is what makes The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain a continued success. Their ability to charm crowds with their humor, musicality and versatile song choice on the ukulele separates the orchestra from other performing groups.</p>\n<p>Not new to the music scene, The Ukulele Orchestra has previously released albums and DVDs with their own label, as well as with CBS, Sony, Longman, Volume and the Ministry of Sound. In addition to covering popular songs of various genres, the orchestra’s original compositions have been featured in TV, plays, commercials and film including silent films for the British Film Institute. The orchestra has also been invited by classical music channel BBC Radio 3 many times to play live on-air, as well as BBC Radio 1, the rock music channel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On Tuesday night, the orchestra attracted and entertained the crowd at Campbell with lively music and a pleasant sense of humor. Though the crowd was comprised of mostly older, middle-aged men and women, UCSB students piled into the seats.</p>\n<p>“You’re watching the best ukulele orchestra in the nation!” ukulele player Dave Suich said as an introduction. “That’s because we’re the only one the nation!” Surprisingly, they are actually not the only ukulele orchestra in the world. They are, however, the very first one that inspired the birth of a dozen new orchestras.</p>\n<p>The orchestra played original songs and covered wide selections of music, from country singer Dolly Parton’s “Joshua” to French classical composer Camille Saint-Saëns’ “Danse Macabre.” Though the performance consisted of eight members playing in unison, each member performed with his/her own distinct character. Some sang solos, displaying a versatility between the plucking and vocals.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me if I sound like Jimi Hendrix on Quaaludes,” joked soloist George Hinchliffe as he covered English rock band Blur’s “Song 2.”</p>\n<p>Different types of ukuleles were featured, including soprano, concert, baritone, tenor and even bass. The variety of ukes allowed the players to play simple and virtuosic tunes in both high and low registers. After many ’70s song covers, the orchestra gave a rendition of Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.” More upbeat songs followed, and a re-energized crowd erupted in syncopated claps.</p>\n<p>“We only have time for one more song,” Leisa Rea said, to which the audience sighed in unison. “Yeah, sorry. We’re going to have to play it,” she teased.</p>\n<p>Overall, an enjoyable night filled with tuneful plucking and clapping was had by all. Created to be entertaining and strange, The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain do not take themselves too seriously. But that is not to say that listeners don’t take them seriously. Whether they are playing popular tunes, complicated chords or just a simple melody, every talented member of the orchestra creates beauty and amusement in a special way that deserves notice for decades to come. If you ever thought the ukulele was a limited instrument, you would have been proven wrong that night at Campbell Hall by The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

muted my friend’s voice before it came through the other end of the telephone, “Yeah man Mångo Mångo just came on! You don’t want to miss these guys get over here quick!” I rushed through the courtyard, was stamped by the bouncers and slid to the front of the crowd only to be engulfed by vibed-out synths and the highflying vocals of Anna Kasper.</p>\n<p>The party was in full form and its celebratory intentions were clear. The audience donned polka-dotted party hats and the floor was littered with multicolored balloons in accordance with the birthday party album artwork of Ghost Tiger’s new EP, <em>Some Friends Feel Like Family</em>.</p>\n<p>Kasper’s vocals continued to hover over the warm synths and cut through the buttery beats with a clean edge. The combination of sweet disco grooves and Kasper’s drop-dead gorgeous looks was the epitome of sensory overload. Her melody lines sent chills up the spine like Lana del Rey, but without the dreary rainy-day feeling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I wiped a dumbfounded look off my face, shook the thoughts of making her my wife out of my head and resolved to dance like a chilled-out, tobacco-rolling hipster. Mångo Mångo had set the tone for this concert at SOhO, centered on the soulful stylized music from heartbreaking frontwomen and their wailing bands.</p>\n<p>Next came the Blues and Greys, another hand-picked opener and local band with a stunning leading lady, Lindsey Ann. Their indie pop sound was reminiscent of The Killers and The Temper Trap, highlighting heavy rolling bass licks, fast high hats and popping snares that held down wandering guitar licks and Ann’s smooth vocals. Both openers were featured at the New Noise Festival last year and surely have a promising future of creation ahead of them.</p>\n<p>Before Ghost Tiger took the stage, we stepped onto the rooftop to get some air, away from the now-brimming club. Outside, drunk foreigners hopped over the gate and tried to bribe security guards for entry into the sold-out show. Wearing thick Russian accents, they begged “Please! Please! We will pay whatever you want!”</p>\n<p>The security guard calmly and sternly pushed them back behind the gate, simply shaking his head. Although, the scene was slightly pathetic, it was a definite validation that SOhO was the spot for seeing the best music in Santa Barbara on this night.</p>\n<p>Back inside, the crowd was packed tightly together to get up-close and personal with the phantom animal, Ghost Tiger. Alixandra Macmillan-Fiedel, the lead vocalist, stood behind a keyboard with a cherry red, semi-hollow body Gretsch guitar that matched her lipstick. Her eyes and pursed lips sparkled as the rest of the band got set. Christopher Norlinger, lead guitarist, strapped up a black Fender Jaguar that crunched out of a tweed Bogner combo, while bass player Kevin Evans was saddled with a metallic gold Les Paul bass. With Emma Huston on keyboard and backup vocals and Chris Stansell crushing the drums, the band was complete and ready to show off their new tunes.</p>\n<p>All of the songs were musically articulate and intriguing in different ways. Some tracks felt as if you were in your mother’s kitchen, while others conjured up memories of heartbreak or the feeling of wandering through a dark, enchanting forest. Towards the end of the set an ominous bang from Stansell’s floor tom reached down into the pits of the audience’s stomachs as an older man whispered to his wife, “I love this song.”</p>\n<p>The song he was referencing was “Whiskey Winter,” which Macmillan-Fiedel described in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> as a chanting song.</p>\n<p>“I wrote (Whiskey Winter) about four years ago … I was walking around the house with this little drum, kind of in solitude going a little crazy with that beat, because you know it’s sort of chanting … it was one of those songs that kind of just came to me and then I took it to the band and we developed it, of course,” Macmillan-Fiedel said.</p>\n<p>Ghost Tiger ended their set with their catchy and captivating new single, “Science Camp.” Spiking the listener’s interest from the beginning with three loud handclaps, the song reels one in with a pulsing guitar chord. Lyrically, “Science Camp” follows the modern love story of royally fucking up and then begging for your lover back. The lyrics are barebones and take the listener for ride with a wonderful building bridge towards the end.</p>\n<p>Ghost Tiger’s EP release party was a supreme success. Ghost Tiger will be on tour for the next few months, so if you missed them at SOhO check out their tour dates on their website or their Facebook page, and of course watch out for Mångo Mångo and Blues and Greys to be blowing up the local scene.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JakyXI73qmQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60044\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/indie-folk-band-ghost-tiger-sells-out-soho-local-band-ep-release-party-was-massive-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60044\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/indie-folk-band-ghost-tiger-sells-out-soho-local-band-ep-release-party-was-massive-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/indie-folk-band-ghost-tiger-sells-out-soho-local-band-ep-release-party-was-massive-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/indie-folk-band-ghost-tiger-sells-out-soho-local-band-ep-release-party-was-massive-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/indie-folk-band-ghost-tiger-sells-out-soho-local-band-ep-release-party-was-massive-success/","id":7728,"author":{"id":745,"name":"Ryan Mandell"},"related":[7727,7726,7725],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jazz Singer Gregory Porter Charmed Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Campbell Hall buzzed with energy as a crowd waited for jazz singer Gregory Porter to take the stage.

Porter has generated an increasing amount of buzz lately; his 2014 Grammy win for Best Jazz Vocal Album only the latest in a stream of high recognition for his work. Given the singer’s reputation and the fact that he does not often play on the West Coast, this special performance brought by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures met a thrilled audience.</p>\n<p>The stage lights went up on Porter’s band: pianist Chip Crawford, bassist Aaron James, drummer Emanuel Harrold and saxophonist Yosuke Sato all looked suave in neutral-toned suits as they played up-tempo jazz. Applause erupted when Porter strode coolly onstage and took the mic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The California native’s rich baritone voice poured forth like honey whiskey, his tone and delivery intoxicating. He wore a grey jacket over a light green vest along with his signature black cap. After a few bluesy verses, Sato took off on a lofty solo that immediately established his impressive sax chops. Crawford followed with a classical-inspired piano solo. The crowd whooped and cheered as the song climaxed into Porter’s passionate vocals.</p>\n<p>After proper band introductions, a riotous bebop tune discharged. Sato and Crawford delivered rollicking solos that had audience members calling out in delight. A man in the back far right of the audience shouted comments like “yeah, sing it!”</p>\n<p>“For this next one, I’m gonna ask you guys to sing along, kinda like that guy is already doing,” Porter joked. “Yeah I see you man, I see you.” Back Right Guy proceeded to sing a very audible harmony atop the call-and-response chorus of the next song. But it didn’t come off as rude. Rather, adding one’s voice in this way seemed to be encouraged.</p>\n<p>Porter then got the audience clapping enthusiastically to the grooving beat of “Liquid Spirit,” the title track from his latest album. Others in the crowd started calling out with emotion during particularly powerful moments. The fourth wall receded more and more as the night went on.</p>\n<p>A highlight of the show came when Porter sang two slow blues verses a cappella. His superb voice and affecting delivery sent shivers down the spine. Suddenly his lyrics melted into a drumroll and the transition filled the room with anticipatory energy.  Harrold then broke into the best drum solo this reporter has ever seen, at once primal and modern, and extremely satisfying.</p>\n<p>The whole band exuded passion and control in their playing. Emotive facial expressions accompanied impressive feats of musical skill. Throughout the performance, sophistication commingled with rousing music and audience participation, two qualities that do not generally lend themselves to a refined atmosphere.</p>\n<p>One self-described former “jazz head” in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, said the show was quite different than the ones he used to see. He mentioned that he had expected a bit more “coherent behavior” from the band, referring to the abundant amount of soloing. He was impressed with the skill of all the performers despite this, particularly Porter and Sato.</p>\n<p>“Peace and love y’all, thanks so much,” Porter said before strolling offstage with a wave and a smile. The audience applauded wildly and gave him a standing ovation as the band continued to play. After a few minutes, he came back and performed several more songs. When he strode off for a second time, the audience rose again in another standing ovation, this time clapping to the beat. The show ended with a satisfying bass solo from James.</p>\n<p>Gregory Porter and his band delivered an exceptional performance last Thursday. It was everything one hopes a concert will be; moving and entertaining with the occasional spine-chill. In this reporter’s humble opinion, the hype about Gregory Porter is well-deserved.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/","id":7724,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7723,7722,7721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A New Kind of Study Playlist – Exploring the Instrumental World of Study Sounds","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"You probably made a New Year’s resolution to dedicate a little more time to hitting the books, but studying doesn’t have to be a miserable commitment this quarter.

Kosmo Kat produces music for the eccentric ones — those fascinated by corny Japanese pop and the cutesy personification of mundane objects. While incorporating the sprightly qualities of ’80s music and futuristic sounds of electronic music, the glittering melodies will leave the listener feeling like an old school animated character in an opening theme montage, complete with faded pastel colors and simply drawn lines. It’s encouragement music that dramatizes you as the main protagonist struggling against academic warfare. Listen here:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"LOVE TRANSITION by KOSMO KAT\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F83911415&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sophisticated Hip Hop by Rage Logic</p>\n<p>Those that go wild for a belligerent bass and an unusual melody will take delight in the bizarre beats of Rage Logic. His music has all the energy of the average hip-hop track, but remains strikingly exceptional with an added pop of sophistication and luxury. The independent producer creates music equivalent to the sensation of that first sip of a cool, fizzy beverage while lounging on a velvety couch in a dim chamber. “P.i.m.p.” is only one sample of Rage Logic’s cocky music. You’ll feel like a million dollars while studying to potentially earn a million dollars.

His other tracks also synthesize elements of hip-hop and Disney-esque melodies to fashion beats that feel hazy, out-of-reach and sentimental. U.HU.RU places the listener in an outdoor Parisian cafe with delectable weather. Studying has never felt so dreamy.

His instrumentals evoke the sense of biting into a ripened peach on a tepid day. Studying to these indolent melodies will keep you at a moderate and unhurried pace, perfect for alleviating built-up stress and worries. “Loose Laces,” in particular, brings a sweet reassurance with a delicately bouncy synthesizer and consistent drum pattern.

Since its start in 1999, the festival has grown infamous for being notoriously difficult to obtain passes for. Typically selling out in a matter of minutes, it eventually got divided into two weekends in 2012. Coachella prides itself on this fact, and on being more than “just a music festival.” For a taste of their smugness, take a look at any of their social media accounts.</p>\n<p>But in Coachella’s case, the extreme positive acknowledgement is justified by the massive excitement surrounding the festival. Each January, four months before the festival is to take place, the lineup is released on a random date, and tickets go on sale the following day. Nobody knows for sure when the lineup will be revealed, but that doesn’t make it any less anticipated.</p>\n<p>This year’s lineup follows the tradition of incorporating a mass of genres, and ultimately doesn’t disappoint. Indie rock and electronic music fans are bound to be the most pleased, but there’s something in there for nearly everyone. Moreover, the festival’s reputation is bound to attract those that the lineup doesn’t (except cynical hipsters). To get a taste of the diversity routinely featured, look no further than this year’s headliners: AC/DC stars as the token revived classic rock group while Jack White and Drake each bring in their own cult followings. Stromae and Yelle also add some unexpected panache, delightfully catering to the French-speaking market, and even the non-francophone will enjoy getting down to their poppy beats.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although Coachella undeniably caters to a huge assortment of people, it can’t seem to shake the notion of being at least <em>mostly</em> an indie and rock event. The likes of Tame Impala and Mac DeMarco will provide the essential carefree festival feel. With the release of their 2014 album <em>El Pintor</em>, Interpol has become a staple at festivals and masters of electrifying the crowd with their fixating vocals and ominous guitar riffs. The return of Ratatat is bound to muster excitement from fans that have missed the jazzy syncopation of their electric guitar and synthesizers after a four-year hiatus.</p>\n<p>Nearly every facet of the electronic music spectrum is represented. Fans will likely have the choice between dancing to the more heavy disco-sounding rhythms of DJs like Duke Dumont and Annie Mac in the pitch-black nightclub ambiance of the Yuma tent, and getting to fully experience Kaskade and Porter Robinson at the Sahara tent.</p>\n<p>Even for those not typically into EDM, Ryan Hemsworth and Cashmere Cat are not to be missed. Their live sets typically consist of a fun assortment of well and lesser-known music remixed and mashed together (think Kanye West merging with blink-182, and it somehow working). And Coachella will be the last chance for anyone to dance to techno master Gesaffelstein. Famous for being a man of few words, the French DJ recently announced that Coachella 2015 will be the last time he plays his live show.</p>\n<p>Along with Drake, Lil B (the Based God), the Weeknd and Tyler the Creator will satisfy the appetites of hip-hop fans. Flying Lotus’ set will likely be an experience in itself, given the eerily psychedelic rap feel of his latest album, <em>You’re Dead!</em>, in addition to his customarily trippy visuals.</p>\n<p>Music and lineup aside, what really sets Coachella apart from other festivals is the large and veritable crowd it attracts, regardless of who is performing. From music fans to celebrities, fashion bloggers to people that just want to experience the hype, everyone comes to Coachella.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s a myriad of other annual music festivals to choose from, ones that can probably save a lot of money, gas and hassle. Festivals like Outside Lands and Treasure Island are typically smaller and garner a much more niched crowd, offering a cohesive environment amongst festivalgoers.</p>\n<p>In exchange for a smaller, hassle-free music experience is Coachella’s glamorous allure, and perhaps what gives it that allure is the huge mixture of people who attend. While the coziness of smaller fests feels warm and safe, Coachella allows its attendants to meet and see people who would probably never be accessible to them outside of the Polo Fields, and that world of possibility in itself feels pretty magical.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/will-coachella-2015-live-up-to-its-own-hype-artsweek-weighs-in-on-the-best-festival-in-california/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/will-coachella-2015-live-up-to-its-own-hype-artsweek-weighs-in-on-the-best-festival-in-california/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/will-coachella-2015-live-up-to-its-own-hype-artsweek-weighs-in-on-the-best-festival-in-california/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/will-coachella-2015-live-up-to-its-own-hype-artsweek-weighs-in-on-the-best-festival-in-california/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/will-coachella-2015-live-up-to-its-own-hype-artsweek-weighs-in-on-the-best-festival-in-california/","id":7722,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[7721,7720,7719],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Catalyst’ Hits Stride in Launch Party","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Greeted by a refreshing, chilly night, hundreds of students and locals gathered in the parking lot of the Isla Vista Food Co-op last December during dead week.

The normally asphalt wasteland was transformed into a luminescent, mystical wonderland complete with glowing triangular sculptures, an artisan village and an abundance of holiday lights. The evening launched issue three of the student-run, literary arts magazine <i>The Catalyst</i>.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Re-started in April 2013 by fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, <i>The Catalyst</i> is a publication that grew out of UCSB’s English department created by the students, run by the students and made for the students. The first issue, released in January 2014, consisted of 80 pages of original student art and writing. Now, after months of planning and preparation, <i>The Catalyst </i>returned with a launch party to celebrate the release of their third issue, which can be found at the media racks in the I.V. Food Co-op or in the English department.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">An artisan village took over the grocery store’s patio, and local craftspeople sold everything from handmade bohemian wear to tie-dye tapestries. Onstage, students recited spoken word, poetry and short stories from the issue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Third-year global studies student Hope Curran, who has participated with <i>The Catalyst</i> previously, showcased her simplistic, nature-based photography at one of the booths. Her inspiration derives from rich spiritual beliefs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I believe we are created to create, to savor the moment that God has created for us,” Curran said. “The co-op is the epicenter of a huge community founded on expression and it really takes one back to their roots.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many artists were showcased in the event’s art walk, which stretched through the walkway to the I.V. Food Co-op doors. Senior Deanna Kim and juniors Corinna Zanolini, Ginger Quinta and Collette McGarrity were a few of the artists, and they brought their own share onto the standing easels and wire racks. One piece that really stood out was the fluorescent wooden-glass, quasi-teepee installation built by UCSB graduates Dominic Moretto and Mark Hoke. The three structures were spaces “where people would be able to get away and recharge.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While attendees recharged in these “pyramids of life,” others headed to the dance floor to get down to local bands The Crash Landings, Sun Daes, Hēlo, Hail Adventurer!, DJ Jones and DJ Ho, and the highly improvised performance of The Abortions, who albeit lacking a key member, were able to capture the praise of the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The space between each set was filled with students reciting poems aloud to the attentive audience. Powerful spoken word poetry was delivered by five students, ranging from fifth-year Erzsebet Vincent’s agony of forgetting about that “one person” to junior Dylan Ginoza’s experience as a gay Boy Scout appropriately coined “an illegal eagle.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Students also read parts of poems and prose published in <i>The Catalyst</i>. One such participant was freshman philosophy major Sam Arrow, who wrote the piece “Yelling Voices.” Arrow described <i>The Catalyst</i> as “the creative [outlet] I had been looking for. I have Natalie to thank for that. I randomly met her in a coffee shop and after having a meaningful conversation she convinced me to submit my work.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The creative outlet Arrow described is the very thing Editor-in-Chief O’Brien had hoped <i>The Catalyst</i> would serve as.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have always been people wanting to participate [in UCSB’s artistic community], and now that we have solidified our repertoire with a growing group of individuals, events like this are able to happen,” O’Brien said. According to her, the purpose of the magazine is to “bring together people at UCSB in addition to bringing together different types of media in a collaborative effort,” which was exactly what was happening at <i>The Catalyst</i>’s showcase.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The magazine has big plans for future events, including a film festival. “A film festival has been in the talk since the release of our first issue, and if our team grows with more like-minded ambitious members, this could hopefully happen spring quarter,” O’Brien said, the glow from the launch party sparkling in her eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With these prospects in mind, one must think of the ways in which the UCSB community can keep this literary magazine alive, so that it does not fizzle out as it had seven years previously. The answer to this is securing enough dedicated members who are passionate enough to hold several fundraisers for the magazine. The whole project is all volunteer power since <i>The Catalyst</i> request for a lock-in fee was denied in the Associated Student election last spring.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This, however, does not discourage O’Brien, who is going to request another lock-in fee spring quarter.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“My favorite thing is being able to help people break out of their shells and find their voice,” O’Brien said, energetically waving her hand at the event that had been in the works for months. “With no funding there is no <i>Catalyst</i> and co-community. So go and write the poem that crossed your mind in your 8 a.m., go paint the way you felt about your breakup, come and join <i>The Catalyst</i> class for Winter Quarter (Interdisciplinary 185CW), because we won’t stop throwing events like this. <i>The Catalyst</i> has brought together the artistic community on campus and in I.V. and hopefully it’s not going anywhere soon.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To get involved in <i>The Catalyst</i> or to submit to the magazine, visit <i>thecatalystucsb.com/.</i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">By infusing the fuzzy ambience of downtempo into classic hip-hop, Ab-Soul’s <i>These Days…</i> became an impressive contender for best album in the realm of genre-bending music. I suggest listening to the album at least twice in order to separately acknowledge the cloudy melodies and brilliant wordplay. The album also features notable artists like Kendrick Lamar and Lupe Fiasco, resulting in a battle of sharp tongues and unparalleled flow. <i>These Days…</i> holds an assortment of tracks that explore varied themes on life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Whether Ab-Soul celebrates decadence, pens a smart sexual innuendo or seeks spiritual tranquility, it is an album composed for thoughtful hedonists — those that ruminate human existence yet simultaneously pine for pleasure. Ab-Soul’s <i>These Days…</i> sufficiently encapsulates this essential balance for both deliberate solitude and heedless indulgence.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If that fails to convince you, the album’s eccentric beats should be enough to pull you in. It’s dark, eerie and slow. “No master’s, but a mastermind,” Ab-Soul raps in “God’s Reign,” referencing his early dropout from college. I thank him for this delicate decision, and you should too.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/oajnyCVSmiIframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/oajnyCVSmiI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Slasher Flicks: </i><em>Enter the Slasher House</em> by Avey Tare of Animal Collective</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nadine Bedwan, <em>Staff Writer</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Animal Collective is known for their foreign sounds, alien beats and lengthy instrumentals. These qualities cement them on the outermost edge of the indie/alternative spectrum, both drawing in and repelling prospective fans. In April of 2014, however, Animal Collective’s Avey Tare released the first product of his latest side project, <i>Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks: Enter the Slasher House</i>.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite the deliciously morbid sounding titles, the album actually features upbeat rock songs which are even poppy at times. The album is definitely more commercialized and mainstream-friendly than nearly anything Animal Collective has ever put out, but it was still crafted with outcasts and misfits in mind.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Little Fang” may be the standout track on the record, offering catchy hooks and an endearing reminder of “you’re something special/embrace your darkness never be ashamed.” Other tracks, like “Strange Colors” and “Roses on the Window” give a pleasurable dose of Animal Collective’s signature psychedelic sound within a more compacted and riotous framework. Overall, this album exudes the vibe of a cute dance party with friends that just happens to be set in a graveyard.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/D6cngTn2_NYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/D6cngTn2_NY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Souled Out </i>by Jhené Aiko</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Brianna Guzman, <em>Staff Writer</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">2014 was quite the year for this L.A. native. From appearances on SNL with Drake in January to her song “The Worst” charting on the Billboard 100 to the release of her debut album <i>Souled Out</i>, Jhené Aiko set the Hip-Hop/R&amp;B world ablaze with this soulful release.</p>\n<p>This beautifully emotional roller coaster of an album keeps your attention from beginning to end. Stylistically, the EP is considered to be “alternative R&amp;B” which has become an emerging genre with the rise of artists like The Weeknd, Frank Ocean and Theophilus London. Echo-laden and lofty, <i>Souled Out</i> tells Aiko’s stories of heartbreak and confusion, from the death of her brother to the struggle of being a working mom.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But eventual enlightenment and lessons are learned through these trials set before her. Highlights include: “W.A.Y.S,” “Eternal Sunshine,” “Spotless Mind” (both tracks inspired by the film), “It’s Cool,” “Promises,” and for all the ladies that have been done dirty: “Lyin King.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/wJ6umyNCvqwframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wJ6umyNCvqw\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Cilvia Demo </i> by Isaiah Rashad</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Elena Bernick, <em>Reporter</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2013, Isaiah Rashad, a Chattanooga, Tennessee native, seemed like an odd choice as a new member of the Top Dawg Entertainment team, whose other artists are predominantly from Southern California.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite this, the 23-year-old rapper proved he’d found the right home with his debut album <i>Cilvia Demo</i>. Released in January, the album was overshadowed by projects released later in the year by his label-mates, specifically Schoolboy Q’s <i>Oxymoron</i> in February and Ab-Soul’s <i>These Days… </i>in June.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">However, armed with undeniably hypnotizing beats and elaborate storytelling, <i>Cilvia Demo</i> deserves to be recognized as one of the best of 2014. It is a perfect blend of Kendrick Lamar’s lyricism, Ab-Soul’s laidback style and Schoolboy Q’s catchy hooks.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Listeners are gently brought into Rashad’s world through a relaxed album that seems simple at its surface, but with repeated listens, becomes complex and enjoyable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In just 90 seconds we learn of Rashad’s troubled relationship with his father and his family’s dependence on alcohol on the appropriately titled “Hereditary.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These themes continue throughout, and by “Heavenly Father,” the eleventh track, we are well-versed in his inner demons. With <i>Cilvia Demo,</i> Rashad shows he can stand out amongst a crew of modern-day rap giants with a unique personality and a brilliant album that never gets old.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/3QOtBKlnEUcframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3QOtBKlnEUc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Black Messiah </i>by D’angelo</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jonathon Choi, <em>Reporter</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">What does this R&amp;B artist have with common with the Holy Son of God? Both have a strong cult following of believers and evangelists preaching the miraculousness of their works. Both have had enough hearsay and rumor-milling to fill a thousand pages in size-five font print. And both Jesus and D’Angelo have only been spotted intermittently after their hiatus from the music industry and humanity.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After 14 years of working with artists from several different genres and complete radio silence, D’Angelo has come back from beyond the grave in <i>Black Messiah</i>.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Deep meaningful lyrics hidden underneath a kaleidoscope of dizzying jazz interludes, guitar medleys and omnipresent bass lines wait to be teased out by the discerning listener. Rather than riding this sonic wave of soul and funk, D’Angelo’s voice parts the ocean and raptures his audience through to the Promised Land.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Black Messiah</i> touches on topics as diverse as police brutality, reminiscent of Mike Brown and countless lives lost to police brutality, to romance and the pyrrhic victory of love. Ultimately, this album reflects a serious gamble on D’Angelo’s part to return to an industry that has changed much since the days of <i>Voodoo</i>, but after hearing his voice soar over the instrumentals of “Ain’t that Easy,” D’Angelo is back and better than ever!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/lZoxdPGu_4E?list=PL_aBdR0uP2I5Mh9Re8WyFeloGSdVWu9Pzframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lZoxdPGu_4E?list=PL_aBdR0uP2I5Mh9Re8WyFeloGSdVWu9Pz\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Singles</i> by Future Islands</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alex Bocknek,  <em>Asst. Artsweek Editor</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This past year was the year for Future Islands. While the band has gone through many awkward post-punk<br>\nphases in the earlier studio albums, frontman Samuel T. Herring and the rest of the gang really come into their stride with <i>Singles</i>. This album is testament that overly-cheesy love lyrics (e.g. “people change, but I grew tired trying to change for you”) are not only for the young Taylor Swift types — men teetering on the edge of middle-agedness can do it, too.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jokes aside, it is not the lyrics, specifically, or the endearing synths reminiscent of New Order or Iggy Pop jibes, that make this album. It is the indubitable authenticity of Herring’s delivery that will not allow listeners to simply write off these heartbreak ballads as cliché.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/-5Ae-LhMIG0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-5Ae-LhMIG0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Black Messiah </i>by D’angelo (vote two)</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alec Hartnett, <em>Reporter</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Upon entering into an old, familiar apartment just after returning to my home of all homes, New York City, strange music permeated the quarters and sucked me to my friend’s room in the back. His brother is playing what I think might be D’Angelo, although the song title and album name are lost on me. Too recent to remember.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On Dec. 15, 2014, R&amp;B and soul virtuoso D’Angelo released an album to bring him back from the dead of writer’s block. At least, that is where it seemed he had become trapped. Hindered by a near-fatal car crash in ’05, and then allegedly soliciting an undercover police officer in 2010, it seemed as if this Grammy-Award-winning artist might not recover, as if another album was anti-imminent. However, slamming <i>Black Messiah</i> into the public last December indicated a clear return of a messiah of the genre.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">What makes D’Angelo transcendent is that he does not pertain to one genre. <i>Black Messiah</i> breaches other genres as well as other social constructs. In a statement that the musician released with his new album, he indicated that this is a message for the people who are struggling against law enforcement and political authority figures.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To his fans, he communicated his political intentions, “For me, the title is about all of us. It’s not about praising one charismatic leader but celebrating thousands of them.” “Prayer,” “1000 Deaths” and “The Charade” all speak towards an injustice all too prevalent in our society. “All we wanted was a chance to talk/‘Stead we only got outlined in chalk.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In one of the more popular tracks, “Really Love,” he infuses a Latin feel with his soulful falsetto. Throughout the rest of the album, funk, rock, jazz, soul and some sort of “neo-Motown” invade his smooth verses, like water running through a pipe. D’Angelo’s musical brilliance explodes from his latest creation and brings him right back into the positive spotlight.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/pQ6ADCTmaNAframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pQ6ADCTmaNA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-music-albums/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-music-albums/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-music-albums/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-music-albums/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-music-albums/","id":7018,"author":{"id":652,"name":"Kelsey Tang"},"related":[7017,7016,7015],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":30,"route":"/categories/artsweek/music","highestPage":35}},"__N_SSG":true}
