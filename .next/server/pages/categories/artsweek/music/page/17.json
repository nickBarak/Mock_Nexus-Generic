Theater. Hundreds of friends, family members and music aficionados popped squats in the lecture hall, painted moodily with green and purple spotlights, to watch the vocalists pour their insides out with song, fart noises and some emotional tears.</p>\n<p>The Brothas’ kindred a capella collectives, Naked Voices and Vocal Motion, warmed up the crowd with their vibrant renderings. The coed Voices gang crooned Ed Sheeran’s “Give Me Love,” while girl group Motion performed Alessia Cara’s contemporary anti-pop hit “Here” without missing a beat of the singer’s breathlessly quick slip-slide flow.</p>\n<p>After rushing the stage rambunctiously, the boys of BFOM goofed around as president and emcee Mason Sperling introduced the night and its talent show theme, which carried through the interstitial vignettes of board-chopping, celebrity impression-ing and some seriously impressive breakneck beatboxing courtesy of resident vocal percussionist Kyle Collet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The guys bobbed, rocked and thrusted their arms about as they sang and uttered, taking on the semblance of a complex and powerful machine. They were a ton of spinning and whirring pieces, working together to produce a layered and cohesive sound greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>They started up their set on an arresting note: that of the iconic Zulu wail of <em>The Lion King</em>’s “Circle of Life.” They shut it down with the song, culminating its performance by lifting its lead, Alex Fong, into the air like Simba to deliver the final line at the top of his lungs. Other set highlights included second-year Isaiah Egan’s playful rendition of “I’m a Believer” (by The Monkees, not Smashmouth) and an amped cover of “Let’s Get It Started” led by Casey Hayes (“that guy from the bookstore!”), which reminded everyone how real the Black Eyed Peas were a decade ago. And they kept runnin’, runnin’ right into the heartfelt climax of their show, when they bid goodbye to their senior members with gifts, memories and some stellar solo numbers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71532\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"452715019\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71623\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71532\" data-attachment-id=\"71532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/bfom-getting-hype-during-their-hit-arrangement-of-lets-get-it-started/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BFOM Spring Concert 5/29\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71532\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"BFOM getting hyped during their hit arrangement of &quot;Let's Get It Started.&quot; Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BFOM getting hyped during their hit arrangement of “Let’s Get It Started.” Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>This segment started off focused on Adam Proctor, with an aptly moving “Come Sail Away” (originally by Styx). As his friends and companions around him built up to the song’s crescendo with their utters, gasps and hums, the lyrics he belted captured the unsure beauty and fear the world at large represents for departing seniors. Collet followed as the pink spotlights dimmed to Lee Brice’s “I Don’t Dance,” which he dedicated to his girlfriend in the audience; he didn’t take his eyes off her the entire time. Sperling gave his absolute all to Aerosmith’s “Dream On,” audibly sad to be leaving the home he’s made with the group yet passionately motivated by his pursuit of his own dreams in the entertainment industry (the boys gifted him with a custom BFOM director’s chair). Finally, David Fowler triumphantly declared “We Are the Champions” with the legendary Queen jam, hitting both high notes and his ambitions: Fowler is moving onto a professional career in a capella.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71528\" style=\"width: 177px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"375715205\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71623\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71528\" data-attachment-id=\"71528\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/casey-hayes-singing-the-solo-for-circle-of-life/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BFOM Spring Concert 5/29\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71528\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1-167x250.jpg?resize=167%2C250\" alt='Casey Hayes singing the opening solo for \"Circle of Life.\" Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus' width=\"167\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BFOM-5-29-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71528\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Casey Hayes singing the opening solo for “Circle of Life.” Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Though for most BFOMers, senior year marks their last opportunity to be involved with something they love so much. This sentiment marked the tears the members shed as they spoke to the audience about their graduating partners, as did their shared memories of befriending and performing with them. Said visiting USF second-year Kian Sheik, who teared up at these earnest sendoffs, “It reminded me of robotics, something I loved to do in high school but will probably never do again.” While graduation will always be one of the most bittersweet events we’ll experience as we leave some things behind and take on a world of new ones, take a page out of BFOM’s goofy, passionate and absurdly talented book and remember to dream on; dream until your dreams come true.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/bfom-bids-grads-adieu/","id":6740,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6739,6738,6737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beyoncé Gets Political in Lecture","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":" Kevin Allred, an adjunct professor in women’s and gender studies at Rutgers University, came to UCSB to give students a lecture all about the legendary Queen B.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71630\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1233015033\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71627\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71630\" data-attachment-id=\"71630\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/beyonce_super_bowl_50/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71630\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyonce_Super_Bowl_50-e1464853649275.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Courtesy of Wikimedia\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikimedia</p></div>\n<p>A.S. Program Board called all devout members of the Beyhive, new and old, to Embarcadero Hall on Thursday, May 25. Kevin Allred, an adjunct professor in women’s and gender studies at Rutgers University, came to UCSB to give students a lecture all about the legendary Queen B.</p>\n<p>Allred came up with this concept of “Politicizing Beyoncé” in 2010, in the form of an interdisciplinary college course designed to analyze Bey’s music in correspondence to contemporary black feminist texts given current race, gender, sex and class politics. His intent, he said, was to “practice using an intersectional lens to analyze pop culture.” What the class aims to answer is whether or not, and if so how, Beyoncé uses her platform to make social justice statements and push toward change. And because Beyoncé refuses to do interviews, all the public really knows of her is through her music and career.</p>\n<p>Before diving straight into Beyoncé’s work, Allred started off showing the audience two different works from black feminists that proved crucial to the understanding of Beyoncé’s music videos. First, Allred introduced Melissa Harris-Perry and her theory of the “crooked room” that black women are put into. With race and gender stereotypes that surround black women, they enter this warped space and have to figure out the correct way to stand. “Some black women tilt and bend themselves to fit the distortion,” Harris-Perry writes in her book, <em>Sister Citizen</em>. In other words, they behave in close adherence to how the rest of the world is behaving. The other piece he showed was a sculpture by artist Kara Walker called the “Sugar Sphinx.” This piece portrayed the well-known “mammy” stereotype, a 35-foot-high and 75-foot-long sculpture of a black woman wearing nothing but a headscarf worn by many Southern black women today and years ago. As expected, many people took sexually suggestive photos with the body parts of the installation. The entire presentation showed how people unsure of how to react to a black woman’s body, even if it’s just a sculpture of one, and resort to dehumanizing her.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moving on, the lecture focused on two of Beyoncé’s recent hits: “Partition” and “Jealous.” As the lecture progressed, students began to understand more clearly the meaning behind the two music videos and how it’s actually all just one storyline. Allred guided his audience into thinking beyond what the music videos clearly show, the underlying message Beyoncé is showing us. For example, there are many partitions in both music videos that we can tangibly point out, but thinking metaphorically, the concept of a partition can be applied to mean much more. “The stereotypes are partitions!” Allred exclaimed, to which the whole audience let out an “ohhhh” in unison. His reasoning was this: Stereotypes are partitions in one’s head, a divide created between you and another person.</p>\n<p>Allred continued to ask the audience about the partitions seen in the music video. A major one spotted was found in a scene where Beyoncé dances with leopard-print light projected onto her. This conveys the “jezebel” stereotype, where black women are seen as hypersexual and animalistic. The light serves as a metaphor, because as it projects onto Beyoncé, it reflects on how this stereotype is projected onto black women.</p>\n<p>Another genius move that Beyoncé makes with these videos is the anonymity of the male figure. When showing a male figure, the camera is angled so that it puts the audience in his point of view. By doing this, it brings the audience into the music video, making them guilty participants in objectifying her. She purposefully puts the audience into a situation to show that people continue to put these stereotypes onto people like her.</p>\n<p>Beyoncé is a prime example of how celebrities with superstar status can and should use their status to inform their audiences about pressing matters, such as the inequality of people of color and how this remains a prevalent issue in modern society. Additionally, it’s easy to simply enjoy Beyoncé’s songs for her melodic voice, their beats and their catchiness, but delving deeper and discovering a new perspective could very well educate one on the depth she purposefully, calculatedly puts into her music.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71627\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71627\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/beyonce-gets-political-in-lecture/","id":6739,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[6738,6737,6736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shwayze Buzzes at Surfrider Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shwayze-Photo-Courtesy-of-Rae-Ann-Varona-PRINT-1-e1464280204267.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shwayze-Photo-Courtesy-of-Rae-Ann-Varona-PRINT-1-e1464280204267.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"IV Surfrider's Concert for the Coast featured booths with info about beach care, raffle prizes and, of course, a free concert with Shwayze as the headliner.

Saturday’s musical festivities were of a similar nature, until rapper Shwayze took the stage and livened up the place.</p>\n<p>This past Saturday, the Isla Vista chapter of the Surfrider Foundatio held their annual Concert for the Coast. The event featured booths with information about beach care and raffle prizes with proceeds going to Gaviota Coast preservation, and, of course, a free concert with Shwayze as the headliner. Audience size fluctuated throughout, but relaxing Gauchos filled Anisq’Oyo for the whole day, and the event functioned as a nice escape from the upcoming stress of finals.</p>\n<p>Before Shwayze’s grand entrance, some alternative reggae bands warmed up the crowd. Cali Conscious, Rebel Shakedown, Layovr and West Swell, which consisted of some UCSB alumni and current students, were among the opening acts. These local talents created a sense of community among the park with their original anthems of Santa Barbara life. Their free-spirited beach vibes mixed perfectly with the shining sun and had the audience in high spirits. There were some familiar tunes in the air as well, as Layovr provided a nice Bob Marley medley and a cover of MGMT’s “Electric Feel,” and West Swell covered “Valerie” by Amy Winehouse and performed a mashup of Drake hits.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The typical widespread seated crowd of the park was quickly moved up to their feet around the stage as soon as Shwayze was set to make his appearance. His DJ came out first and offered the crowd their first chance to get “Shwaysted” with some EDM before the man of the hour officially performed. Although his opening track, a Bob Marley EDM remix, came off as slightly tasteless, the following hard-hitting drops effectively conditioned the crowd for the fun night to come.</p>\n<p>Shwayze finally hit the stage at around 6 p.m. and the crowd reacted with appropriate energy (to say the least). He was accompanied on stage by the aforementioned DJ, as well as his hype-man/five-year-old son, Hendrix. Hendrix mainly just played around the stage as his dad performed, and occasionally was picked up to help mouth some of the lyrics. Although Shwayze made it a point to take hits from the various joints burning in the crowd as well as to continually remind them to “light up,” he often comically covered his mouth and watched his language when his son was listening.</p>\n<p>The young rapper’s set list consisted of tracks spanning throughout his career, including songs from his self-titled debut album as well as his most recent work “King of the Summer.” One of the most energy-inducing performances of the night included his 2014 hit, “Love is Overrated,” which the audience continually screamed along to. The throwback feel was clearly alive and well as Shwayze jumped around the intimate stage.</p>\n<p>The whole crowd was alive with familiar reminiscence as the summer partier performed the first hits of his career, “Buzzin” and “Corona and Lime.” The park knew a surprisingly large amount of the lyrics as the rhymes rung out into the air. Needless to say, because these two songs are essentially the staples of Shwayze’s career, they provided the most rewarding moments of the night. Although jumping and dancing saturated the entirety of the set, the most enjoyment came from his two biggest throwbacks.</p>\n<p>In complete transparency, it doesn’t take a music analyst to know that Shwayze doesn’t exactly compare to the other acts that have come to UCSB this year, especially when the show took place a week after the extremely anticipated Extravaganza. However, this event was a raging success for multiple reasons. Firstly, Shwayze can actually put on a hell of a show with a remarkable amount of personality and likeability. Secondly, it was a very heart-warming gathering of hundreds of Gauchos in the name of summer relaxation and quality music. Lastly and certainly not least, the community came together for a good cause — the preservation and protection of local beaches — and raised some good money. Love him or hate him, Shwayze’s here to have a good time, and the crowd was always down to join in.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

online radio streaming like Pandora, you will more than likely come across a station called “Indie Folk.” On this station, you’ll hear a smattering of bands that create just that: music from an indie template that heavily relies on folk sensibilities. Admittedly, the peak of indie folk has passed, but I still find myself gravitating toward the music of The Lumineers, the three-piece at the helm of the genre.</p>\n<p>The band was formed in New Jersey, where lead singer Wesley Shultz and drummer Jeremiah Fraites first bonded over music through loss. In 2002, Fraites’ brother Josh, who was Shultz’s best friend since childhood, died of a drug overdose. The two quickly decided to do music full-time and spent seven years schlepping their way around New York City’s open mic nights. However, success proved difficult to find in New York, and the band decided to relocate to Colorado. When they arrived, the duo posted a Craigslist ad for a string instrumentalist and met classically trained cellist Neyla Pekarek, who completed the band’s permanent lineup. Soon after, they signed a record deal and were slated to record their first album the next year. The self-titled debut was released in 2012, and the single “Ho Hey” immediately topped the charts. The jangly guitars, declarations of love and bombastic shouts of the nearly inescapable track were the perfect catalyst for an indie folk revival.</p>\n<p><em>Cleopatra</em>, the three piece’s sophomore effort, is centered around a more mature sound. It was penned over the course of six months in a house the band rented in Denver. However, it stays true to their confessional-narrative style of songwriting. The Lumineers decided to take a quiet approach to the album after the dizzying amount of fame they achieved following their first album. Two months ago they released a piano-driven track, “Ophelia,” to little fanfare. The mid-tempo single does not sonically stray too far from their previous songs, but lyrically Shultz alludes to his disillusionment with fame. Following the tone set by “Ophelia,” the rest of the album is notably insular, but the band uses this to their advantage, creating a world of strong women and long journeys to live in for 45 minutes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Predictably, folk purists consider indie folk a non-genre, but the music is for people that appreciate the crossover qualities that exist in virtually every modern act. The Lumineers began the same way that many folk pioneers did: young and world-wise. More importantly, they believe in their music with the same relentless energy, which is the reason they can exist on the same playlist as Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell. The Lumineers translate the passion of their music into one of the most emotional, genuine shows a band could put on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The Lumineers play at Santa Barbara Bowl on May 28th.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

tandem with the crash of cymbals and the whisper of bed sheets folded around the bodies of hundreds of college students on Sabado served as reminder that it was indeed Saturday, May 14, the chosen date for the fourth annual Togapalooza, a yearly event that serves to assemble the most notable bands of I.V for an all-day music festival from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. Second-year Jack Tannenbaum, the organizer, looking a little harried, said that he decided to keep the tradition going because “music brings the community together.” Togapalooza was definitely primarily about the music, so here’s a little rundown of what went down.</p>\n<p><strong>Frisson</strong></p>\n<p>Frisson marked the commencement of Togapalooza 2016. Starting their set at 12 p.m. on the dot, they had a groovy, electronic-indie rock energy that served to ease one into the mini-fest. Their sound was lulling at times and exciting at others, proving them definitely a group to keep an eye out for. Upon seeing the band play from the rooftop of her toolshed, neighbor Michelle Angellilis commented,”It’s so cool that they put this together.” She was referring to Frisson, as they were killing it, but also to the event more generally. It was an auspicious morning.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Rabbit Foot</strong></p>\n<p>Their set hit right afterwards at 1 p.m. The energy of the punk band was brash, quick, loud and angry; lead singer Cris Sharma’s stage presence was completely reflective of the mood the music lent to the audience. He wore only a “Borat”-style neon green singlet and a furrowed brow. The most important part of the performance was the impression that the band members didn’t give a shit. They liked what they were doing and in the process gave a killer show.</p>\n<p><strong>Feral Vida</strong></p>\n<p>Feral Vida — an I.V. classic — slayed. Their Strokes-inspired sound was almost nostalgic, the vocals raspy and affecting. Their beachy rock vibe appealed to the audience. The crowd never stopped dancing during the performance, grooving to the music until the set ended. The band mates seemed to hold real love for each other and that translated into a kickass performance. After the show, lead singer and fourth-year Max Schultz, said that “the band members were sticking around I.V. after graduation” to continue making music, so stay tuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Posterchild</strong></p>\n<p>Their performance was wild. The lead singer, one of only three women to perform at Togapalooza, had a super eclectic, jazzy vibe. The crowd couldn’t help but meld together in an intense fit of dance when they began their rendition of “Hotline Bling.” The mood engendered by the band was positive and the instrumentals and vocals working together articulated a sound unlike any of the other bands that performed at Togapalooza.</p>\n<p><strong>Cooler Hats</strong></p>\n<p>Cooler Hats is definitely one of the most up-and-coming groups in the I.V. music scene, especially after this weekend’s show. Having just done away with their previous, less self-assured name (The Openers), the group has been in a state of flux, constantly redefining and refining their sound and identity. Graced with the addition of their new lead singer, second-year Isaiah Egan, they killed their set at Toga, easily giving their best performance yet. We caught up with the group after the show and they left us with the following: “Big thanks to Jack Tannenbaum for organizing Toga and to Savage Henry, especially John, for helping us get on our feet. Look forward to even more jams from us this summer.”</p>\n<p><strong>Hypno Rings</strong></p>\n<p>The most bona fide jam-seshers of the day, Hypno Rings, revitalized a tiring, boozed out crowd with their unique, jazzy style. The group may lack a singer but fills the void by implementing the smoothest sax you’ve heard since your mom found her old Kenny G collection. Whereas many I.V. concerts draw crowds with free booze and blink-182 covers, Hypno Rings popularizes itself using raw technical skill and manages to be one of the only notable I.V. bands to succeed in doing so. Whether it’s downtown at Velvet Jones or in your friend of a friend’s backyard, Hypno Rings are a breath of fresh air from the sometimes stale realm of live I.V. music.</p>\n<p><strong>Savage Henry</strong></p>\n<p>The most savage festival in the most savage town could end in no other way than with the most savage band there is: Savage Henry. The west stage headliners once again attracted a dense, animated crowd. The energy sent out by the band was picked up and amplified by the mosh pit, which grew so large that it began sucking in the whole front half of the audience. With each power chord, the guitarist — who looked as though he’d been pulled right out of a Vietnam War protest — strummed, a visible wave propagated through the crowd, building with intensity each time. All in all, the image of Savage Henry going completely savage in front of a toga-clad audience as one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen crowdsurfed above it all will live on as a quintessential Isla Vista moment that I will remember for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Togapalooza was a smashing success. Over a thousand people came out to support the bands of Isla Vista, and the vibes were there to match. If you weren’t having a good time, it was probably your fault. Though the event was epic, it’s important to note the homogeneity of I.V. bands overall. The performers were predominantly white, and there was relatively sparse female presence. Second-year Hannah Houska, who has a history of public policy, backed this up. “It was enjoyable, yet I would have loved to see more female artists in I.V. … If anyone’s down to form a girl band, hit me up.” While all the talent on display certainly exhibited a lot to be proud of, the Isla Vista music scene can only benefit from more variation in its look, its influences and its sound.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Free yerba mate on tap subbed for the $10 beers cupped in hands on polo fields all over California, and the colorful décor was complete with a pair of 20-foot insect sculptures constructed by Bamboo DNA, a collective of veterans to the festival circuit. Natalie Koe, Festivals Coordinator of UCSD’s A.S. Concerts &amp; Events, said she “LOVED the art and decor aspect of the festival. That’s something that is hard to find at other college festivals because students often don’t put much effort into the art side since they are so focused on the music side,” though she also congratulated Program Board on booking such an exemplary lineup.</p>\n<p>As the music started up a bit after 1 p.m., the crowd remained relatively sparse. Opening acts Emancipator and Zella Day played amicably to the assorted audience, though each had to share stage space with the other’s (and Anderson .Paak’s) equipment. “It was a bit odd to see Emancipator, Zella Day and Anderson .Paak not given the full stage since there were other production pieces still on stage,” noted Koe.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The Oxnard native oozed pre-supernova glow, decked out in a flashy windbreaker, some signature circle shades and an undeniable swagger. Alternatingly strutting around up and down the stage or deftly smashing on his drumset, .Paak flashed with his virtuoso skill and charm.</p>\n<p>Displaying his range, the multihyphenate rapped and crooned jams off his lauded latest release <em>Malibu</em>, including “The Bird,” “Heart Don’t Stand a Chance” and “Put Me Thru.” Included in the setlist was .Paak’s closest thing to a party song, “Drugs,” off the less recognized (and less sonically distinct) <em>Venice</em>.</p>\n<p>.Paak and his band, the Free Nationals, proved an excellent addition to the fest with their energetic blend of R&amp;B, hip-hop and funk. As those on the field grooved to the Free Nationals’ cover of the iconic Nile Rodgers riff from Bowie’s “Let’s Dance,” those stuck in the expansive stretch of a line lamented that they couldn’t join them in time to catch the end of the set.</p>\n<p>After .Paak’s electric act, students squashed in to wild-out with Rae Sremmurd. The 20 and 22-year-old Brown brothers, Swae Lee and Slim Jimmi, bursted onto the stage. Heralded by SremmLife crew member D-JaySremm and joined by the rest of their squad (and a heap of pineapples), the duo riled up the crowd with their hoppy energy and unabashed attitude. Lee rocked a Prince tee, which he quickly tossed to bound around tats-out in the sweaty heat. His brother donned a certified-dope denim coverall worthy of the Zara and H&amp;M replicas you’re sure to find on racks in a couple months; both let their dreads bounce and swing with the thump of their beats.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71020\" style=\"width: 285px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71020\" data-attachment-id=\"71020\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/extravaganza-by-stephen-manga-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-9.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Extravaganza 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-9.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-9.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71020\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-9.jpg?resize=275%2C413\" alt=\"Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd.

The screens behind them depicted 8-bit avatars of themselves hopping through neon cityscapes or a bottle spinner landing on pie slice categories with dreadfully on-the-nose imagery like emojis (eggplant included) or a “Netflix &amp; Chill” slogan. Despite their youth, they still couldn’t avoid the corniness that comes with co-opting all things viral, though the goofiness of it all lent to their devil-may-care demeanor.</p>\n<p>After blasting through a seemingly inexhaustible list of <em>SremmLife</em> hits like “No Type,” “No Flex Zone,” “Throw Sum Mo,” and the unquestionable banger that is “Unlock the Swag,” the rappers played “Look Alive,” the first single off their upcoming, aptly-titled <em>SremmLife 2</em>.</p>\n<p>Carson Capps, bassist for local band The Duds and a member of Program Board’s production staff, mentioned how the show was literally lit: “The sound system was crazy and a few of the subwoofers actually caught on fire during the show; we could smell the melted rubber while we were packing up!” Regarding the cavalcade of dancers that stormed the stage at the group’s invitation, Capps noted, “eventually a few climbed on ODESZA’s gear and we had to get them off! They did not want to go. It sounded like the performers were about to call us out for kicking the girls off, but they ended up yelling about Trump instead, which was cool.” It was cool; Sremms launched into a souped-up rendition of “Up Like Trump,” replacing its usual lyrics with expletives bashing of the woefully legitimized candidate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71017\" style=\"width: 220px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71017\" data-attachment-id=\"71017\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/extravaganza-by-stephen-manga-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Extravaganza 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71017\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?resize=210%2C315\" alt=\"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"210\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-6.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jennifer Kim, a second-year who joined the Sremmlife crew on stage, called it “a carefree and fun experience that had me reflecting on how the year is coming to a bittersweet end … I have so much love for the other women dancing on stage with me because I see the world as our stage.”</p>\n<p>Like .Paak, Swae and Jimmi wrapped up with someone else’s song: the breakdown to Ghost Town DJ’s recently and virally resurged 1996 R&amp;B jam “My Boo,” inciting Vine-worthy jittering in the rambunctious crowd as Sremmurd departed for their “Afterparty in LA!”</p>\n<p>Taking shelter from the amassing horde of blacked-out shovers in the graciously shaded bleachers, one could relax to the relatively chilled stylings of electronic darlings ODESZA. The Seattle duo certainly provided an engaging performance but its mellow vibe didn’t quite befit their billing as the event’s headliner.</p>\n<p>Known for their involved live act, members Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight beat on some drums and were joined by live trumpet accompaniment, which — despite their distinction from many other electronic acts — did not quite live up to their buzzy reputation. In fact, the choice of ODESZA’s position as a headliner is a bit dubious; though perhaps more popular, their act didn’t match the raw energy of Sremmurd’s or the ecstatic instrumentation of .Paak’s. Though the outpour of crowd reaction for anthems like “Say My Name” and their remix of Zhu’s “Faded” proved they deserved a spot on the lineup, their role as the ultimate act was a bit of a cooldown. Said KCBSB host Elena Bernick, “ODESZA was cool, but their live show wasn’t as exciting as I heard it would be, and they weren’t even close to matching the energy of Rae Sremmurd or .Paak. It would’ve been better if one of them had closed the show.”</p>\n<p>ASPB certainly outdid their already esteemed selves with the studded list of performers, and the relatively smooth run — save for the aforementioned line drama and some slight technical issues with the LED displays — of 2016’s Extravaganza makes it one for the books.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/in-review-extravaganza-2016/","id":6736,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6735,6734,6733],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"María del Pilar Shares Truth in Song at MCC","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C525&ssl=1","description":"“Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor.” The words rolled off smoothly as del Pilar strummed the strings of her ukulele.

Throughout del Pilar’s performance it was clear that embracing who she is a motto that she lives by.</p>\n<p>Just about every seat in the building was taken and the crowd was filled with a variety of people. It was a fusion of cultures; the conversations that went on in the venue were in several different languages. People were anxious and a few minutes had already passed by after the scheduled start time. Despite the slight delay, the performer did not waste any time in delivering her eclectic sounds. Immediately after taking the stage, del Pilar took control and made the building a place full of energy. Her first song was intense. The way she sang was so passionate that it caught the crowd off guard.</p>\n<p>“<em>Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor</em> (You and I dance vigorously).” the intimate words rolled off of her tongue smoothly as she strummed the strings of her ukulele. The passion from her high-pitched vocals resonated throughout the room. Del Pilar’s fluorescent vocals were also accompanied by some amazing electric guitar accompaniment. The guitarist’s solos were intricate and very well done. The riffs vibrated throughout the room and created a powerful and alternative aesthetic. All the sounds going on meshed together perfectly and created a pretty and melodic vibe within the small venue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After just about each one of the songs she performed, del Pilar shared some insight about her life with the crowd. She spoke about the bicultural influence that has inspired her to bring about this English and Spanish blend.</p>\n<p>“I started off with a band called ‘Los Abandoned,’” del Pilar shared. “We started somewhat of a Spanglish scene in Los Angeles. I just thought I should share with you all some of my back story since you may be wondering why I am dressed the way I am.”</p>\n<p>Del Pilar, embracing her roots, danced on stage wearing high-waisted pants and a large flower around her neck. Her energy rubbed off on the audience, and people were either standing and dancing — which del Pilar highly encouraged — or bobbing their heads and tapping their feet. It was evident that the artist has a rebellious soul and that all she wants is to have fun doing what she loves most: sharing her art with others and empowering those who face similar circumstances as hers. She spoke about the obstacles that her father had to overcome in order to provide her with a good life. Her father’s will to strive is what fueled her ambitions to be not only a musical artist but also a role model to others.</p>\n<p>“I am still going to do my thing despite anything that comes my way,” del Pilar exclaimed as she began her final song of the night.</p>\n<p>The singer finished off her setlist with her song “Quien Eres.”</p>\n<p>“This song is about not being afraid of who you are,” she stated. It was [[a]] night of Chilean alternative pop with a hint of young angst. Once the event was over just about everyone in attendance stood in line and waited to pick up a copy of del Pilar’s album <em>Songs+Canciones I</em>. I made sure not to leave without grabbing one for myself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/","id":6749,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6748,6747,6746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Underbelly Makes Waves with ‘Ripple’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"1,436 SoundCloud followers and counting and a new EP full of futuristic vibes, the Santa Barbara prodigy is set to take the electronic scene by storm in only a matter of time.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_70892\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-6-e1463040428945.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251146596\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70892\" data-attachment-id=\"70892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/underbelly-makes-waves-with-ripple/underbelly-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-6-e1463040428945.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Underbelly  5/12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-6-e1463040428945.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-6-e1463040428945.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70892 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Underbelly-6-e1463040428945.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hi, I’m Underbelly, and you suck at producing.

Along with DJ Shadow, some other influences of his are Balam Acab, Clams Casino and the revolutionary jazz/hip hop instrumentalist Flying Lotus. After years of studying the greats and perfecting his own craft, the UCSB student is ready to create some classics of his own.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underbelly recently went on a european tour with Azeem Ward and just released an extremely promising 3-track EP entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on April 19.

The dauntingly strong opening track, “Breather,” captivates its listeners with a Kali Uchis vocal sample that demands a second play. “Stingray” follows, with an intimate piano sample and steadily bouncing beat that expresses raw and powerful emotion, even without any words. The ending track, appropriately titled, “the end,” closes the EP with dreamy ambient chords that shake the listener into musical oblivion. A very thick and smooth collection, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes for great study music as well as an ambitious soundtrack for the DJ’s gradual rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mere taste of what he has to offer, Timmy commented on the work, stating “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I hope to make a splash that reverberates far and wide in today’s music world while also testing the waters before releasing my debut album later this year.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything, I was just tired of keeping these songs to myself for so long and was itching to put them out there.

Going into more detail about the R&amp;B project, Timmy entailed, “Seriously, this guy’s voice is as thick and sweet as molasses and matches my production perfectly.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, if his new endeavors resemble anything of his past work, UCSB and the rest of the world are in for a serious treat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the name of supporting local talent and, more importantly, in the name of quality art, we strongly urge all of you to check this guy out.

“Heading Home” tour, the multi-instrumentalist and music producer, Gryffin, made a special pit stop at UC Santa Barbara in The Hub last Thursday, May 5, for a special pre-Extravaganza performance hosted by A.S. Program Board. The musician, whose real name is Dan Griffith, first learned to play music via the piano at a very young age. “I started taking classical piano lessons when I was seven. I’ve been playing instruments for a while, and then I picked up the guitar when I was in middle school,” Gryffin shared in an exclusive interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. Infused with live elements of an electric guitar, piano keyboard and melodic house beats, Gryffin’s sound is immediately presumed to be influenced by the classic rock genre.</p>\n<p>“Even when I was younger, my older cousin Dustin was in this band called Thrice — which was a punk, hardcore-type band. I idolized him growing up and went to a lot of his shows,” the producer reminisced of his early musical inspirations.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70929\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1401915147\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70929\" data-attachment-id=\"70929\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/chrome-sparks-hub_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70929 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The opening DJs, UCSB’s own Conner McEuen a.k.a.

It’s like a serious throw back song now, but I remember looking back listening to that, and being like, ‘what is this music, this is insane,’ it’s sort of what opened my eyes.”</p>\n<p>With a series of original remixed hits such as Banks’ “Beggin For Thread,” Years’ “Desire” and BØRNS’ “Electric Love,” the Bay Area native accompanied each track with a live instrument of a guitar or keyboard for a fresh, unique sound. Most notably known for working with new artists like those mentioned above, Gryffin is a champion for rising talents. “Something about the up and comers, like supporting the music that is on the rise, it’s really exciting to work in that wheel house because it’s like fresh ideas and fresh inspiration — just like being in the mentality and mindset of those types of artists,” Gryffin said. “I’m really inspired by Bob Moses. I got to do a bunch of stuff with them at SXSW and Ultra — which was really cool.”</p>\n<p>The highlight of the night was Gryffin’s original production with singer Josef Salvat in the record titled, “Heading Home.” As the artist/producer’s first ever single, the track is an uplifting dance anthem that speaks of finding a guiding path in life amidst of the chaos and hardships. The song is a big transition for the musician, who has thus far only released remixes of original songs from various artists. A big surprise of the night came from an appearance of singer and UCSB student Grace Nevins, who sang a new, unreleased track, “Love In Ruins.”</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the remixes is how I got my name out there to begin with so I don’t have to abandon that at all. I still enjoy doing it, but over the course of the next year, it’s definitely going to be more of a focus to do my own stuff,” Gryffin spoke about his new music. “I’m working on an EP right now. I’ve got another single that is almost finished that I’ll probably come out with in June. I’m just actively pursuing and working on a bunch of new content”.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70930\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1846474080\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70930\" data-attachment-id=\"70930\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/gryffin-in-the-hub-5-5-16-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gryffin in the Hub 5-5-16\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-70930\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70930\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>To conclude the night, Gryffin ended his set with his most famous remix, Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” (which was also the song that introduced me to the artist). With 17 million plays on both SoundCloud and Spotify, “Talking Body” has catapulted the musician to a wider audience of fans and music critics. After playing the final guitar chord of the song, the musician thanked the audience for coming to see the show. The 26-year-old debuted his live performance this past New Year’s Eve at SnowGlobe Music Festival and has been headlining his first tour ever since. Gryffin is ultimately looking forward to some free time to obtain brand new inspiration after finishing up his sold out tour, “I get to enjoy a few months off in the summer to write music, which is gonna be sweet!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

embarked on the musical journey of what would become their latest album, <em>Wiped Out. </em>Since the release of the album, the band has restlessly toured numerous cities across several countries. Sweater weather may be over for Santa Barbara natives, but as of this Tuesday, The Neighbourhood will be bringing it back in full force to the Majestic Ventura Theater. The show was originally booked at the Santa Barbara Bowl but made a move to the Majestic Ventura Theater, where all tickets will be honored.</p>\n<p>The two EPs <em>I’m</em> <em>Sorry </em>and <em>Thank You </em>and debut album <em>I Love You</em> respectively were the building blocks for the success of the band we as they are today. They became known for their black and white aesthetic, as seen in their scenic rotating clips for songs like “Flawless” and “WDYWFM,” along with their overall social media presence. With their appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” The Neighbourhood performed a stylish live television debut in black and white. Even after the departure of their original drummer Bryan Sammis, their status as the band to be on the lookout for remained, as did their loyal fanbase dedicated to decoding their cryptic melodies. In 2014 The Neighbourhood dropped a mixtape titled <em>#000000 &amp; #FFFFFF</em>. The mixtape consisted of several singles the band had previously released along with a few new ones featuring artists like YG, Raury and French Montana.</p>\n<p>After the release of the mixtape, however, the band went off the radar for a span of time to recover from the constant shows and festivals they had booked as well as to get to the root of what their next work of art would be. Out of this brief hiatus bloomed their sophomore album<em> Wiped Out!,</em> a fiery, complex treasure that would take all of their fans and critics by surprise. Listening to the album by its lonesome is a journey, so seeing The Neighbourhood bring it to life will be a vivid experience. There is no doubt that this band aims to please, and it would be an honor for anyone to say they were in attendance when the Majestic Ventura Theater got “wiped out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Regardless of what the details consisted of, if one were to compile a soundtrack for that summer it would include Walk The Moon’s youthful tune, “Anna Sun,” crafted as if it were made for that summer. Not just because it was named song of the summer by various publications, but because it is difficult to not associate it with breathless, unscathed memories accompanied by the feeling of lightning running wild through the heart. Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive those memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.</p>\n<p>Walk The Moon is the type of band to release a song that will send your emotions spiraling, yet one tends to forget to take the time to get close with their music. There are numerous releases of good music day by day, so it makes it difficult to accomplish such a task. However, when it comes to Walk The Moon, it is rewarding to be more than merely familiar with their music; those that actually take the time to immerse themselves in their sounds might just discover their new favorite song.</p>\n<p>Similar to the love they received for “Anna Sun,” Walk The Moon received overwhelming attention for “Shut Up and Dance,” an upbeat, electric single from their latest album, <em>Talking is Hard</em>. In comparison to a number of their other tracks, the song proves difficult to sit through without singing or dancing from the heart. Out of all of their songs, both “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance” are the two that the band is commonly associated with, so one could expect to experience the joy flowing off of the stage and into the crowd as people sing in unison with every ounce of love spilling from their lungs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/","id":6764,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6763,6762,6761],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza 2016 Lineup Revealed","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-Reveal-ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-Reveal-ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A.S.

which brings scores of UCSB students carpooling into the desert every spring? Apparently a lot; the <em>Nexus</em> hit Coachella 2016, and here are some of Artsweek’s highlights.</p>\n<p><strong>LCD Soundsystem:</strong><br>\nExcessively buzzed about once they announced that they’d be reuniting for a new album and tour in 2016 after their dramatically heartfelt and measured disbanding in 2011, LCD Soundsystem delivered one of the most polished and groovable sets of the weekends. Soundsystem proved apt nomenclature, as main stage became scaffolded with keyboards, drum machines, synths and people to produce the intricately layered and progressive anthems the band churns out. Frontman/visionary James Murphy and an arrangement of longtime compatriots like Nancy Whang and Pat Mahoney riffed seamlessly through their patented danceable tracks that make you think, like “Someone Great,” “Get Innocuous,” “Daft Punk is Playing at My House” and “Dance Yrself Clean.” They also paid tribute to some late greats, with covers of Prince’s “Controversy” and David Bowie’s “Heroes.” “I wasn’t a huge fan of them before going to the festival, but one of my friends convinced me to go. Their music was really powerful. Murphy’s voice was unbelievably good, and their performance definitely made me a huge fan of the band. The set pretty much defined all of Coachella for me,” said UCLA sophomore Andrew Gorin. Such a definitive performance makes the band a welcome addition back into today’s musical landscape; the promise of the buzz was well-kept.</p>\n<p><strong>Sheer Mag:</strong><br>\nSheer Mag lead singer Tina Halladay welcomed the band’s noontime audience at the Mojave tent with an admittedly reticent “Hi, we’re Sheer Mag,” before tearing into the mic with the opening track off of their most recent III EP, “Can’t Stop Fighting.” Halladay carried a quiet yet detectable charisma about her — tough to detect from her notable refrain of crowd interaction but undeniable when her high-pitched vocals ground into a screech — as she belted heartbreak ballads and grievances with the American political system. Even despite the limitations of the 30-minute set length, the low-billing, Philly-based garage band proved to be one of the most impressive sets of the weekend due to their unusual marriage of ‘70s revivalist singing, fuzzy instrumental overlay and genuinely fun high-fi guitar riffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Algiers:</strong><br>\nHot off of the release of their debut self-titled album, Algiers showcased both one of the most theatrically powerful and technically refined performances of the weekend in spite of their low-billing Saturday afternoon spot at the Mojave tent. Their sound sits somewhere in between post-punk and noise rock with a curveball peppering of gospel and blues. Lead vocalist and guitarist Franklin James Fisher would often spend the first minute of each song crouched on the stage looping cacophonic guitar riffs into a pedal, meticulously tinkering the distortion and then hastily tossing the guitar to the floor in favor of a tambourine and mic. Immediately following every other verse, Fisher collapsed at the knees into a position somewhere between a fetal curl and a prayer kneel, slamming the stage with the tambourine and a closed fist, the sweat on his back often glistening through his white-collared shirt. Songs were punctuated with late 20th century radio samples deploring institutionalized religion and served as the only nonmusical communication between band and audience. This was easily one of the most impressive sets of the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Courtney Barnett:</strong><br>\nCourtney Barnett has been on the receiving end of quite a bit of accolade, with her debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit making many 2015 year-end lists and earning her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Her distinctive lyrical style always feels like aimless meandering through vividly mundane yet accessible scenes of poolside crushes as a conduit for profound thought exploration, while always remaining playful enough to land far away from any sense of pretention. During “Elevator Operator” and “Small Poppies,” Barnett was brought to her knees mid-guitar solo in an act of rocker-geist possession often caricatured in bad ’70s hair metal bands but perfected by the endearingly manic Jack Whites and Dan Auerbachs of the world. In between songs, she awkwardly chuckled and said things like “We like you guys,” or a simple “Thanks,” almost as if her manager told her she had to be nice to her fans. More likely, though, she’s just that lone person at the party exchanging clunky pleasantries, but is actually super sweet once you get to know her.</p>\n<p><strong>Anderson .Paak &amp; The Free Nationals:</strong><br>\n2016 is the year of .Paak. Born Brandon Paak Anderson, the R&amp;B singer, songwriter, drummer, producer and rapper has largely slipped under the radar of hip hop fans for the majority of his professional music career. However, 2015 was exceptionally kind to .Paak, as Dr. Dre plucked the rapper out of obscurity to contribute to a whopping eight tracks on Dr. Dre’s latest release, Compton. .Paak’s January release, Malibu, has garnered him widespread media attention, citing his compositional complexity, strong lyrical content and energetic live performance. .Paak spent much of his Coachella performance bouncing between his mic and his drum kit with the only consistency throughout the performance confined to the intermittent declarations of his catch phrase, “Yes, Lord!” and his cheek-to-cheek, white-toothed grin. Both Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar came out in support of the budding star, a testament to both .Paak’s talent and his future enshrinement into the pantheon of West Coast musical legends.</p>\n<p><strong>Sufjan Stevens:</strong><br>\nAfter touring with an intimate and human set to support his last effort, 2015’s quiet and folky Carrie &amp; Lowell, fans didn’t know quite what to expect from the adeptly talented multi-instrumentalist in a 2016 festival setting. Flanked by a groovy Valkyrie duo of backup dancer-singers, a kinetic brass trio and eventually a cropping of inflatable air dancers, Stevens delivered an extravagantly theatrical act. There was banjo smashing, disco balling and costume changing (Suf wore erratic costumes ranging from a set of gigantic feathery wings, a get-up of dozens of swaying and bouncing mylar balloons, to a towering set piece resembling a crucifix-esque metallic jellyfish). He blasted through Age of Adz touchstones like “Too Much” and the 25-minute “Impossible Soul.” Even his C&amp;L cuts were arranged up to match the energy, culminating with a performance of “Fourth of July” in which Stevens and his backup cried out emphatically the refrain that “We’re all gonna die.” “It was a big change from the last time I saw him, in a really good way,” fourth-year biopsych major Roni Brawley said, who also called his timely Gallant-accompanied cover of “Purple Rain,” “moving.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sia:</strong><br>\nThe enigmatic Australian songstress held down main stage Sunday night with one of the most bizarrely artistic and moving sets to grace the polo fields in, possibly ever. Obscured in the corner by her signature black-and-blonde wig and a dwarfing oversized white bow, Sia let her belting vocals and a slew of guests weave her story of pain, depression and triumph. The set bolstered hits like “Diamonds,” “Titanium” and “Chandelier” with performance art conducted by the eclectic likes of a tearful Kristin Wiig, a bewildered and accosted Paul Dano, frequent collaborator and dance prodigy Maddie Ziegler and more, all unified under matching checkerboard wigs to match the songstress’s striking aesthetic. The level of artistry presented by the set was unprecedented for the festival, especially when stacked against the droves of partiers shoving through the agape crowd to camp out for Calvin Harris’s following set.</p>\n<p>Speaking of artistry, the visuals at this year’s fest were notably more subdued than the imaginatively photogenic fare of previous years. Poetic Kinetics, the design studio behind iconic works like the enormous and mobile snail, astronaut, and caterpillar/butterfly mascots were conspicuously absent this year, and the Do Lab stage, while still the center for free-for-all bone-vibrating bass and PLURality, re-used its Big Fish stage setup, which debuted last year. Rumors have abounded about the hefty sum Goldenvoice hoisted over to Guns N’ Roses for their headlining gig, siphoned off from supporting more visual artists. Whether these are founded or not, the money must’ve gone somewhere; in regard to the huge “Besame Mucho” piece backgrounding the polo field, senior Lauren Gutches scoffed astutely “Just because they’re in a different language doesn’t make giant words any more interesting as art.” Portals, a piece by Philip K. Smith, was a noticeable standout amidst the stagnance of the other works, reflecting and shifting subtly in light and color, as fourth-year Josh Swedelson noted, “like an Apple Store display crossed with the ‘Hotline Bling’ background.” As people posed for photos in front of the piece’s glowing rings, opening their own portals into their lives and themselves to become a part of the piece, the mirrored slats reflected outward onto the other-worldly festival outsides raging like the desert winds. Through music, art and, well, a lot of other things, Coachella offers portals into another universe for a weekend, one that it was a pleasure to get lost in.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70724\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70724\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/","id":6761,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[6760,6759,6758],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jojo Abot Charms MCC","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/HYPNO-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/HYPNO-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The energy of the performance was heavy and wild; it vibrated through the MCC theatre.

Her piercing command was directed towards aspiring artists “Do it.” Create. Thematically speaking the energy of the performance was heavy and wild; it vibrated through the MCC theatre.</p>\n<p>Dressed up in a slick, powder blue jumpsuit, and adorned with a wrap snaked around her neck that swayed behind her back, Abot was intimidating. Silvered, metallic paint smeared across her face symmetrically formed both an exaggerated brow and thick rectangles on her cheeks. The act itself was loud, punctuated and rhapsodic; her lyrics at times were indiscernible and difficult, but that is her style and it works. Taking a quick break after a particularly intense song, she spoke of Santa Barbara: “[It’s] so clean … everybody is so rich.” She flashed a quick smile, baring bright, dangerous teeth. Laughter rippled through the audience.</p>\n<p>Those present were drawn into a trance-like dance despite the limitations of the small seats in the sometimes too-warm room. Blue light danced off of faces, and the screen behind Abot imposed video of the 101 freeway styled in a distinctive retro quality.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before starting her next song, she laughed, and said, “I want you to join me.” She motioned behind her as a command and kept her eyes trained on the audience, her desire clear.

It seemed that within that room anything could happen, or rather, she could make anything happen. After a particularly intense song, the music stopped. “That was our last one,” she said, then promptly performed two more. “I never want the party to end,” she cackled.</p>\n<p>After the performance wrapped up and the lights turned on, the party didn’t stop. Everyone attending the show collected in the main room of the MCC, little webs of conversation floating in the air. One of these was spun by Alex Gallant, a third-year environmental science major at Long Beach. “[She had] impeccable range. Her style was an infusion of jazz, ethiopian and reggae.” The vibrant energy of the show leaked into the mood of the room. People were animated and excitement was palpable in the air as everybody waited for the reappearance of Abot. When questioned on Ms. Abbot’s stage presence, Kennady Reason, a second-year history major at UCSB said, “She was really getting down and dancing.”</p>\n<p>When Abot finally moved from the theatre into the lobby, conversation stopped, and a half-moon of fans formed around her. She greeted strangers like old friends, giving hugs and posing for photographs. As I watched her mingle, laugh and converse, her voice was like a spell, folding those who listened into a web of her own making.

All of these raging successes, however, have been mere stepping stones leading to the landmark that took the internet by storm last thursday: Drake’s highly anticipated new album, <i>Views. </i></p>\n<p>Since the album’s release date was announced back in January, all eyes have been on the Toronto native. Extreme hype has been built up for this album; <i>Views </i>has popped up in shops in major cities, advertising billboards all over Toronto, an announcement for a tour with Future, wildly popular pre-released singles and, in the true spirit of Drake, countless internet memes. Released exclusively on Apple music, many excited fans — this writer included — signed up for a free trial to get to the music as soon as possible, carrying high expectations and childlike anticipation.</p>\n<p>Although the album is arguably not Drake’s best work to date, <i>Views </i>offers Drake in his purest form, with peak vulnerability and comfort over extremely strong production. At 20 tracks, the work feels a bit excessive and unnecessary, but the consistent supply of grooves along with the balance of upbeat and slow tracks  keeps listeners heavily intrigued. Overall, with a fair share of smooth vocals and gentle progressive vibes, <i>Views</i> feels reminiscent of vintage R&amp;B, emotional Drake.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Some of the album’s strongest tracks are the singles that were released prior to the full album, including minimalistic banger “Pop Style,” caribbean dance anthem “One Dance” and mega-hit of last summer, “Hotline Bling” (as a bonus track). “Pop Style” specifically came as a new album version that features only Drake verses rather than the single version, which included Kanye West and Jay-Z. Although incredible and iconic tracks, the pre-release route seemed to be a bad call, much like putting all of the funniest scenes of a movie in the preview. This lapse in marketing, however, could not shadow the multiple other highlight tracks that <i>Views</i> offers.</p>\n<p>Heavy hitting slappers “Still Here,” “Hype” and Future collaboration “Grammy’s” provide the most upbeat moments of the project and remind listeners of Drake’s powerfully strong 2015 hits. However, besides these new tracks and “Pop Style,” the album mainly highlights Drake’s soft singing voice and the hip-shaking, smoothly bouncing production from his OVO team.</p>\n<p>Some other stand out tracks include “Feel No Ways,” which includes synth tones that sound straight out of the ‘80s, and collaboration with Rihanna, “Too Good,” which features a steady dance drum beat that demands dancing. These songs most accurately capture the general feel of the album, as<i> Views</i> is less about the rap hits and more about the iconic OVO soul vocals.</p>\n<p>This new stepping stone for Drizzy marks a semi-significant musical change in his ever-evolving style. With <i>Views </i>as well as <i>If You’re Reading This</i>, we hear his production transition into a more minimalist theme. All of the beats on this album showcase a very thin, almost calm structure, which is contradictory to his past <i>Take Care</i> days of densely layered beats. We generally only hear two or three sounds in the background, thus putting all the focus on the clever introspection of the 6 God.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Drake’s past work, it pains me to say that although <i>Views </i>is a very consistent album that will make for a lot of intimate moments, it just doesn’t live up to its potential. Given Drizzy’s previous work, his smash hits last summer and the earth-shattering hype that led up to it, the music here could just do a little better. There’s nothing wrong with this album by any means. The beats are nicely flowing and it definitely has its high moments, but it all seems to plateau at a midpoint and never really blow any minds.</p>\n<p>As I said before, Drake has been fucking up the rap game for some time now. He’s had <i>Pitchfork</i> features, headlining gigs at festivals, groundbreaking albums and owls as far as the eye can see. Maybe he got too comfortable or maybe his reign is coming to an end, but Drizzy just missed a big opportunity. The 6 God was given a true shot at rap immortality, but instead of redefining the game, Drake merely stirred it up.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/","id":6760,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6759,6758,6757],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":17,"route":"/categories/artsweek/music","highestPage":35}},"__N_SSG":true}
