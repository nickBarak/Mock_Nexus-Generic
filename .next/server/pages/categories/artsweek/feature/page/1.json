During this hour-long conversation, the vlogger intimately discussed his rise to fame, experience as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and what it’s like dealing with crazy fans </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of whom crashed the live session by exposing her bare breast on camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board members Gabriel Reyes and Nathaly Pacheco moderating the discussion, Dobrik was able to answer specific questions of relevance rather than relying on the hectic chat room, which filled up with hundreds of messages by the second. Perhaps one of the things that got so many people excited was the appearance of other beloved vlog squad members who have been with Dobrik since the beginning: Natalie Mariduena and Ilya Fedorovich. Both Mariduena and Fedorovich grew up alongside Dobrik in Chicago, Ill., and now live with him in their shared mansion in Los Angeles, Calif. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jumping right in, moderator Reyes asked Dobrik what the first thing is that he wants to do once this COVID-19 quarantine ends. Known for capturing both his and his friends’ antics on YouTube, were any of us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surprised when Dobrik replied with, “Probably go to the bars. I miss seeing my friends drink in public places”? Of course, after earning a laugh, Dobrik quickly followed this up with a more serious answer, explaining that he’s simply excited to get back to work.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing the conversation, Dobrik talked about his social media consumption, claiming that he’s got a special place in his heart for one app in particular: “I am probably the biggest fan of TikTok, and I hate saying this because I sound like I’m some sort of hipster, but I promise you, I was using it before it was cool.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As moderator Pacheco moved the discussion from TikTok to Dobrik’s YouTube career, Dobrik emphasized how important the element of stress was during his rise to internet fame. Although he claimed that his original schedule of posting vlogs three times a week got difficult to keep up with, the stress that came along with it ended up being the perfect amount of fire he needed to become the sensation he is today. “Moral of the story is, if you’re stressed out, keep going,” Dobrik said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, things got fun and lighthearted again as Reyes asked if Dobrik could show everyone his infamous </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliemachadoo/status/1262958639427416064\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flamethrower</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a gadget often used in his more daring vlogs. While we may have been happy with just seeing the instrument itself, Dobrik took it a step further and instantly put it to use (and, honestly, I was genuinely worried he might accidentally burn his house down). The gag was over in seconds, with Pacheco commenting, “I don’t think [the Zoom viewers] thought you’d actually do it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his meteoric rise in popularity, it’s no surprise that Dobrik often faces fanatic subscribers, who apparently show up at his doorstep quite frequently. “People show up to the house, and it’s so fucking scary. We hate it,” Dobrik said. While some experiences are more pleasant than others, like the time Dobrik ran into a guy who ended up playing John B in the recent Netflix series “Outer Banks,” Dobrik said that most of the time, it’s just downright uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of his most “memorable” fan encounters (and I say “memorable” with a grain of salt), Dobrik explained how every fan “thinks they’re the exception” when they show up to his home uninvited. One fan in particular, Dobrik explained, showed up to his house claiming that he needed to show Dobrik a video </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a video on how this man found out where Dobrik lives, how he followed Dobrik home from a party and so on. “Those situations are pretty sad and scary,” Dobrik said. “Once in a while, people just show up, and we think it’s our time to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about DACA and his current view on the political landscape, Dobrik explained how he wants his YouTube channel to be an escape from the hectic world outside the internet and not a place where his audience feels divided. “This sounds so cheesy, but it’s so true,” he said. “I just want [my channel] to be a place where people can just watch videos and forget what’s actually going on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrik then recalled an instance when he was in Texas and met a number of students who are part of the DACA program, explaining how frustrating it was to see “everyday” people having to struggle when they contribute so much to society. As a DACA recipient himself, Dobrik said, “I have high hopes for all DACA people.” Although he kept his answers on these serious subjects somewhat short, it was clear Dobrik had much more to say.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the event, moderator Reyes added that his housemates (who are huge Dobrik fans) were all watching the livestream in a separate room. To this, Dobrik invited them to come join Reyes, where soon after, one of the housemates immediately pulled up her sweater to reveal her naked breast to Dobrik and everyone else watching at home. While most got a laugh from it, a few people on </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateGatsby/status/1263026527769251841\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> questioned the appropriateness of this act, wondering if it still would have been perceived as funny if it had instead been a man exposing himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this livestream was filled with several unforeseeable moments, Dobrik accomplished something great: He brought laughter and entertainment to an audience stuck at home during one of the craziest times any of us have had to face thus far. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

amateur,” and one </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night, the UC Santa Barbara student body was able to see history being made. Courtesy of the Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board, students could pull out their paintbrushes while watching a one-of-a-kind Q&amp;A art tutorial. And who is the man behind it all? We’ve all heard of Pablo Picasso, gazed at the works of Leonardo da Vinci and, hell, we’ve even watched Bob Ross, but now we’ve experienced Miles McCollum, more famously known as Lil Yachty, craft masterpieces effortlessly from the comfort of his shoe closet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just a short one-hour debut via a Zoom webinar, Yachty opened up to eager </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listeners about all aspects of his life, answering question after question from the A.S. Program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board and the UCSB student body. Decked out in a red beret and an eccentric rainbow sweater-shirt, Yachty teetered a blank canvas on an easel, all the while seamlessly keeping up with the conversation. Using his MacBook as a ruler, he invited the crowd to create lines with him. And, spoiler alert, these lines became a series of one-dimensional squares, despite the Q&amp;A being anything but one-dimensional.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interviewers were eager to hear about Yachty’s rise to fame in 2016.

Referencing iLoveMakonnen’s “Tuesday,” Yachty reminisced about the “newness” of his sound, and he thinks that other artists ought to create music that bends the rules. But more important for him than any rapper or musician, Yachty gushed about his mother being his greatest inspiration of all. Not only did his mother work two jobs to support him and his sister, but she encouraged both of her children to follow their dreams. “I well overpaid her,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how did Yachty’s ship sail from being a college student to a well-known musical mogul? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He brought us back to a time when he worked at both McDonald’s and Six Flags, stating vividly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that they “fucking sucked,” and he was ecstatic to get out of there. Between going to college and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making a new plan altogether, well, he did both, leaving college after a year to pursue a career in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">music. His father, Shannon McCollum, who is a dignified photographer, would tell Yachty </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stories about his encounters with the rich and famous backstage. Looking to be successful, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty figured he had a shot at being a musician, too.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94377\" style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"547971027\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94377\" data-attachment-id=\"94377\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/lil-yachty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=1200%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lil-Yachty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=888%2C539&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-94377\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=764%2C464\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94377\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Urban Islandz</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now painting his fourth somewhat symmetrical square, Yachty encouraged everyone to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work hard, even to the point of failure, in order to follow their dreams. Once an avid credit card scammer, Yachty pointed out that as fun as it was, he needed to do something more </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distinguished — and not illegal. He even holds himself to a certain standard. “I don’t drink, I never drunk in my life,” he said to the camera. His reasoning? He believes drunk driving will end badly (which it will) and ruin whatever someone has going for them in life. Quite a fair message, especially given his audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he became disgruntled by his artwork, referring to it as “the jankiest bitch,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty made sure to promote uniqueness and creativity, particularly in the music industry. “People respect originality so much,” he said. In an ode to 21 Savage, Yachty applauded the rapper’s use of murder in his songs, just because it was shocking and new.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently everyone is different for a reason, so owning your uniqueness is crucial. But having the newest sound or most outrageous lyrics are not the only things to bring you to fame. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist told us that he used to sleep on A$AP Rocky’s floor and even ran his errands just to be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">associated with him. In his case, it worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to the up and coming, Yachty rolled names off his tongue of talent that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shouldn’t be slept on. He said Duwap Kaine and Cody Miles are both really “dope.” In terms of his own music, Yachty teased the idea that he will be working with Joji, which excited his fans who had watched their conversation on 88rising’s YouTube channel. With new music coming our way, it was no surprise that “Act Up” by City Girls was mentioned since he wrote the entire song himself. Between eye rolls, he told the crowd he thinks City Girls are “very themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting a deep maroon square near the top of his canvas, Yachty listened as the interviewers brought up his infamous crimson dreads that made his image. Now letting his hair grow out sans bleaching and coloring, Yachty told the students that his hair fell out from over-processing it, which apparently he’s never told people before. The fans made do with the red beret he sported for the time being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And food: Now what could be more enticing than that? Yachty prides himself on never having eaten vegetables, instead opting for a slice of glorious pizza. Every. Single. Day. Sounds like some of us college kids, doesn’t it? When venturing to LA, he enjoys the local shop, Delicious Pizza, which is surprising because he claims to “never eat out, ever.” But in the future, he hopes to open his own pizza joint in Atlanta, so he can enjoy his “cheesy” habits and share them with the world, too (and, for the record, his dining choices have no effect on his flawless skin, which he claims to inherit from his parents).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Near the end of the Friday painting questionnaire, the million-dollar question popped up: so, why the name “Lil Yachty?” A group of people in school called themselves the “Yacht Club,” and when McCollum joined, he was the youngest, or the “littlest.” And from there, he was Lil Yachty (shoutout Lil Boat!). Currently, when he isn’t giving art tutorials to bored and quarantined college kids, Yachty is working tirelessly on his new album. Featuring female artists on the tracks, it’s sure to be one for the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finishing off his eight-square masterpiece, Yachty let us in on his love life. While children are definitely a must for him, to this day, he has never been in love — or heartbroken, for that matter. “I haven’t found the right person to create a person with,” he said to the anticipating listeners. And on the familial note, he let us all know he has no plans for Mother’s Day since his mother is hooked up to his bank account. “Every day is Mother’s Day for my mom,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to close out the hour-long endeavor, Yachty gave a simple yet heartfelt shoutout to the class of 2020 as they graduate with great success. Oh, and that painting, if you were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of such glory, will be signed and sent to our very own UCSB, to either hang in the UCen or be given to a gracious student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While COVID-19 pissed on the much-anticipated Deltopian bonfire, the A.S. Program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board did not neglect to bring Yachty’s charm to the UCSB students. No Zoom class will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever be quite as entertaining, or maybe even as educational, as this past Friday night’s Yachty art expo.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hgeorge/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah George</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah George is an Artsweek writer for the Daily Nexus.

Mitchell added that his inspiration stemmed from a renewed appreciation of the children’s yogurt, a name now shared among his newest album and his favorite snack. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Mitchell revealed that there’s more to it than just the name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that in his Danimals prime, Mitchell did not like to share his yogurt as a kid, instead opting to keep it for himself. After departing from his prior band, N/A, Mitchell applied this same mentality to his newest pursuit — this time on a much bigger level. Almost all the vocal and musical elements for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were crafted by Mitchell himself, an element of production he learned to embrace after deciding to embark on his project alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was putting in more effort than everybody else [in the band] and I said ‘fuck that.’ I can just do things by myself. When people were pushing me to be my own artist, it kind of revamped me to where I was … So I learned from this group who I am and I’m going to go [do this] by myself,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we talked through the project’s five-month timeline, Mitchell elaborated on his unorthodox and experimental nature when producing the album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I quickly became familiar with the fact that Mitchell is picky, a desirable trait in music. In “Sancho,” for example, Mitchell produced the track three separate times: once as a trap beat, once as a Mariachi beat and once as a “trap-Mariachi” beat. To produce the song “Tokyocitypop,” Mitchell had to sift through two years’ worth of his own archives to find what he was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was going through old beats. I was making new beats. I was experimenting with beats. I was experimenting extremely with sound … I want [this album] to represent exactly how I’m processing this. I treat this album like a film. I’m the director, but I’m also the writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his favorite memory with the album, Mitchell knew right away: the time he produced the third portion of “Tokyocitypop,” a track inspired by his feelings of hopeless romanticism. It didn’t come easily, though. After fabricating “four versions” of the track based off “15 different samples,” his thirst for the proper soundtrack was finally quenched.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music aside, Mitchell also worked to produce content that wasn’t limited to speakers. After $500, a trip to Studio City, a rented mansion and a camera crew, the music video for “Sancho” was born. “Bird” followed suit as well, in which Mitchell revealed there was “a whole lot of planning” and “a lot of different scenes.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88184\" style=\"width: 1377px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2115137870\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88184\" data-attachment-id=\"88184\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0021/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0021\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88184\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=888%2C1330\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1330\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88184\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But everything aforementioned is about the finished products — what about everything that led to them? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Stockton-bred artist recommends “just fucking do it.” Mitchell advised if you’re interested in dipping a toe into the music world — jump in. Immersion is the fastest way to learn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nine times out of 10 you’re gonna suck when you start. It’s okay to be bad as shit. You develop,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replication, according to Mitchell, is a tool for progressing in music that comes not too far after taking the initial plunge. Before “you can be yourself” in music, Mitchell explained that it’s easiest to mimic similar styles of other musicians first, then taper down and try to produce music unique to yourself. Once that’s all down, Mitchell explained, then you can commit to making your own music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s much easier said than done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning when he was 11 years old, the now 21-year-old Mitchell has spent the last 10 years blowing air into trumpets and strumming guitars and, most recently, bass. This time period paralleled his zeal for a variety of music genres such as rock and metal. As for hip-hop, he was interested in that, too, but surprisingly “not that much.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with his affinity for Weezer and System of a Down, Mitchell also has an ear for mariachi-style music, elements of which can be heard throughout </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When chronicling his timeline of favorite genres, Mitchell somewhat alluded to a third facet of learning music: Take pride in what you make. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a musician, Mitchell placed a heavy emphasis on preserving his artistic vision. After returning to his hometown of Stockon, for example, Mitchell caught the ears of other people in the recording studio who heard him play the beat for his song “Neotokyo.” He was immediately flooded with requests to be featured on his song — all of which he declined. But why?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very psyched about features and I don’t want to feature you on this song,” Mitchell told those who asked. Mitchell explained to me that when he has an idea, he sticks to it. He also told me it’s not nice to invite yourself onto somebody else’s soundtrack — it’s rude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When producing music, Mitchell pays careful attention to his craft, treating “voices as instruments” on top of the already-present soundtrack. Mitchell’s explanation of his production game showed me just how much effort it takes to create quality soundtracks, a facet of the music industry he finds with not enough light shed on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting into this time when we’re finally starting to recognize producers. You had Zaytoven, Lex Luger, TOKiMonsta, Flying Lotus — all these producers who just weren’t recognized” — and now, finally, they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For trap music specifically, Mitchell believes the beat is “meant to shine,” while other styles, such as boom-bap, are meant to complement the lyrics. Regardless, if it wasn’t for a quality soundtrack to support the lyrics of many popular songs, Mitchell has a hunch that “rappers wouldn’t be shit without a beat.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To produce a beat, however, inspiration always helps. Mitchell finds his inspiration by treating each composition as a “very open diary.” In doing so, Mitchell’s music doubles as both a soundtrack and narration of some part of his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never rocked by shit I’ve never done. That’s a very big rule. Even in my most hood-rat songs, I used to do all that. That’s the whole point,” he said. “I have Tinder love. I swiped right, she swiped left — that shit hurt! These are funny things, and, you know, how do I talk about this?” he said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88186\" style=\"width: 694px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147752975\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88186\" data-attachment-id=\"88186\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0728/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0728\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-88186\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728-684x1024.jpg?resize=684%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two full albums and nearly ten singles on Spotify alone, it’s clear that Mitchell has many stories to tell — a few of which have garnered noticeable amounts of attention on the popular music-streaming app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With recognition comes fame, but Mitchell doesn’t want it. When asked if he has any desire to be famous in the future, Mitchell said, “It’s cool … but I don’t give a fuck about being famous.” If it happens, it happens. But he says he likes his privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell also hopes to one day make outrageously expensive music production software more accessible to help students have an easier time mastering it and alleviate the pain of shelling wads of cash to acquire even the most essential tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His reason? Education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Mitchell really cares about is teaching. When he’s not behind a DJ set or an instrument, he’s behind a desk, teaching students how to transform their ideas into tangible compositions. After </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/new-hip-hop-classes-bounce-into-campus-next-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teaching a music production class</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through the College of Creative Studies last winter quarter, Mitchell will be attending the University of Southern California next fall to earn a master’s degree in music education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kids that I taught music composition and hip-hop to — I want them to become famous. I want to sit down and be like, ‘They did that. And I’m proud of them,’ ” he said. “I’m not gonna sit here and ask for money. I just know that I did my job as an educator and happened to rap and produce my own stuff. At the end of the day, I just want to teach.”  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

producer's reflections on the Oscars, mainstream movies and following his passion for film. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us not entrenched in the world of sports, the Oscars have the tendency to be our Super Bowl. We host viewing parties, place bets on winning nominees and dissect the newcomers and veterans with an equal sense of spectacle. The Academy Awards hold a reputation of launching the careers of unknowns who metamorphose into Hollywood giants before our very eyes.  We’ve seen nominees like Hailee Steinfeld, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quvenzhané Wallis and this year’s newcomer Yalitza Aparicio transform their careers solely based off of Oscar buzz. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is apparent that this fanaticism does not stray from the stars of the pictures. Ask anyone to name you a producer of the film — a nominee of the coveted Best Picture Oscar — and they would likely balk.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For somebody who was nominated for the crème de la crème of awards, Peter Saraf is breathtakingly humble. He does not fit the image of a fast-paced, no-nonsense Hollywood producer. Saraf, his wife Erika, their teenage children Olive and Oscar and their schneagle Harry, live in a renovated two-story apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, just a stone’s throw from Central Park. The apartment walls are adorned with Erika’s paintings, as well as many done by her father, renowned painter Daniel E. Greene. There is no doubt that the Sarafs are certainly well off (a two-story apartment in Manhattan should have clued you in), yet their home is cozy and inviting — they know their doorman and their neighbors — practically the polar opposite of the fenced-in mega-mansions synonymous with reclusive members of the entertainment industry on the opposite coast.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s introduction to the film industry was no coincidence; his late father Irving Saraf was a quadruple-hyphenate producer-director-editor-academic, as well as an Academy Award-winning documentarian for his 1991 film “In the Shadow of the Stars”. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Saraf was in high school he had the opportunity to work as a production assistant on some of his father’s films, and get a better sense of his career. Make no mistake though, coming from a film dynasty did not pressure young Peter into his career in the entertainment industry — in fact sharing such a binding love of film with his father is what allowed Saraf a unique appreciation for the power of movies later in his career: “He and I shared a lot. We saw a lot of movies together, and that was just something that we did together all the time from as far back as I can remember,” he said with a twinge of admiration in his voice. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life,” he said. After wandering about overseas, working odd production jobs and unsuccessful attempts to go to film school, Saraf found himself back in New York where he managed to get a job as an office manager for Jonathan Demme, who was best known as the director of the cult classic psychological horror film, “The Silence of the Lambs.” Saraf ended up working with Demme for 10 years: “It was my film school, it was my job, it’s where I learned really what a producer does, and where I learned that I liked producing and that I had a certain affinity for it.” He rose through the ranks from an office manager to producing documentaries, to narratives, to eventually becoming a partner of Demme’s and producing projects together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf has always had a knack for telling stories about human beings, and “Little Miss Sunshine” proved to be no exception. Many will fondly remember “Little Miss Sunshine” as the screamingly funny, horrifically inappropriate family road trip comedy that follows the Hoover family as they try to make it to Redondo Beach, Calif. for their daughter Olive to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The beloved script was well known and had been floating around industry purgatory for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many found the film too risky to make: it was an R-rated comedy with an ensemble cast, with the plot centered on a child and it was unlikely to have a strong international audience, as child beauty pageants are a uniquely American cultural phenomenon.  In 2004, Saraf and his partner Marc Turtletaub co-founded their production company Big Beach. Turtletaub, who had been a developer of the script, dreamt of making the screenplay a reality. “We managed to get it back from the studio that owned it that wasn’t making it, and made it independently,” Saraf said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie was filmed over the course of 30 days and premiered at Sundance in January 2006. In addition to scoring one of the best distribution deals of the festival and raking in $100.5 million at the box office, “Little Miss Sunshine” received rave reviews and heaps of nominations during the awards circuit that year, so Saraf and Turtletaub were eager to see if it would make the cut for the top five of the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees (which expanded in 2009 to include up to 10 films). </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86818\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"860773318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86818\" data-attachment-id=\"86818\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/profiling-peter-saraf-the-man-behind-little-miss-sunshine/26suns-2-600/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg?fit=600%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26suns.2.600\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A still from the 2004 cult classic Little Miss Sunshine.

Courtesy of The New York Times.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving a nomination for Best Picture, as Saraf and Turtletaub accomplished with “Little Miss Sunshine,” however, is arguably the most daunting task of the entire Oscars process. Academy voter Curtis Clark explains that of the 24 branches of the Academy — which one joins on an invite-only basis — each branch is only responsible for nominations within its own domain, with the exception of Best Picture, which is the only category to receive nominations from all branches across the board. Clark is a renowned cinematographer and a recent recipient of the</span><a href=\"https://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/curtis-clark-to-receive-john-a-bonner-award\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which is awarded by the Academy) for his exemplary contributions to the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf and Clark are quick to note the honor of being nominated for an Academy Award, but neither believes that it makes an enormous impact, career-wise. Clark acknowledges that for somebody who is not a member of the Academy, “it may have distinct opportunities for certain types of jobs,” but Saraf does not believe that his nomination has opened any doors for him, though “it doesn’t hurt to have ‘Oscar nominee’ associated with your name,” he admitted. He continued with a chuckle, “I say I’m an Oscar loser.” Saraf believes the true mark of success is the endurance of the movie over time. “People remember the movie more than it was nominated, and that to me is much more meaningful and impactful. I love that people still remember the movie and care about it and continue to watch it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry (and world) wide celebration of film and its unifying properties is what Saraf appreciates the most about awards season. He loves that the awards circuit seeks to honor the movies every year, and that its popularity amongst the laypeople signifies a much deeper connection. He does admit, however, that there is a nastier, political side of awards season that viewers are unaccustomed to seeing or hearing about. In Saraf’s eyes, this petty side of awards season is what detracts from its value; it is the antithesis of the pure, wholesome love of film that he grew up on when seeing double features with his father.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seriousness of the Oscars — and its implications as a marketing tool for an extended life at the box office — has earned the entertainment industry an insurmountable sum of money, but has led to a more sinister side to what should ultimately be a celebration for achievement in film. “That gets translated into literally the kinds of things you would see in a political campaign. You have consultants who do opposition research on other movies and the people behind them,” he said. This “oppo research” includes digging up old tweets, unflattering quotes, accusations, allegations about the film’s credibility and so other kinds of dirty tricks you’d only imagine to find on a political drama (see this year’s hotly contested Best Picture winner “Green Book” for </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/green-book-oscar-chances-peter-farrelly-nick-vallelonga-controversies/580087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prime examples</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all of these).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The night of the Oscars doesn’t stand out as incredibly sharp in Saraf’s mind. He noted the foreign experience of being on the most impressive, star-studded red carpet in the world, but feeling completely invisible — even as a nominee for the most anticipated award of the program. He recalled being a bundle of nerves, the torturous feeling of being the last award of the night and the ridiculousness of the cash-only bar in the lobby (you’d think the most prestigious awards in the industry could splurge on free booze).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was actually a little terrified that we were going to win because I was so nervous to be on that stage,” he said with a hearty laugh, before admitting that it was a disappointing loss, regardless.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s work has remained more of the indie variety since his nomination 12 years ago. Things seem to be looking big for Big Beach this year, however. Saraf and Turtletaub are loaded with projects in post-production as well as some in the works, including a Mr. Roger’s film starring Tom Hanks set to premier at Thanksgiving, “The Farewell” starring Hollywood breakout Awkwafina which premiered to rave reviews at Sundance and upcoming projects with Lasse Holström and Natalie Portman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is impossible to compare the works of fellow nominees, being nominated alongside Clint Eastwood and Alejandro González Iñárritu must certainly create a sense of pressure and pride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Saraf has often chosen to go off the beaten path and pursue the indie genre, it appears that maybe more than a decade after his Best Picture nomination he will find himself back in the mainstream. “There’s a bunch of stuff coming – I’m not exactly sure what we’re going to make next, but that’s what’s in the pipeline,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf isn’t feeling overwhelmed by pressure to earn another nomination, but rather he is continuing to do what he does best: tell the stories of human beings. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that epic kiss between Madonna and Britney Spears at the 2003 VMAs to Katy Perry’s 2008 hit “I Kissed a Girl,” straight artists have been using the taboo of same-sex relationships to cause a stir among audiences, and, unfortunately, we have not left this trend in the 2000s. Music artists have been “queerbaiting” for a while now, and the LGBTQ+ community is not happy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Ariana Grande is the artist who is a prime example of this dynamic: Her recent music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored” and her headlining of the Manchester Pride celebration this upcoming August have received plenty of criticism from the LGBTQ+ community. However, Grande is consistently open about her support and love for the queer community, so what’s the big deal here? What </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queerbait, is Grande guilty of it and why are people mad about it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored,” Grande flirts with another woman, and the two lean in for a kiss that is never realized, as right then, the video ends, and the imagery suggests that the singer wants the couple to break up so that she may be with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not the man. This would be an adorable twist if Ariana was actually a member of the queer community, but presumably, she is not. Apparently, the video is meant to relay a message of self-love: The other woman was Ariana all along, and Ariana is celebrating herself. But this is never made clear in the video itself. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ambiguity is a prime example of “queerbaiting” — people in the public eye hinting at same-sex relationships, either in their personal lives or in their work, without confirming their actual “queerness,” therefore attracting gay fans while avoiding the discrimination that these fans face everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are angry when straight musicians like Ariana Grande depict same-sex relationships and they are perceived as fun, flirty and harmless by vast audiences. In real life, queer teens are still being called slurs in school halls, trans people are assaulted for their identities and gay couples still worry about what will happen if they hold hands in public. Queerbait is straight artists utilizing the shock factor of gay relationships for attention, without providing any real representation or advocacy for LGBTQ+ fans. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86743\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1320652399\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86742\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86743\" data-attachment-id=\"86743\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=2048%2C1510&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1510\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-966939330-1549449240\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=888%2C655&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86743\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=888%2C655\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"655\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=768%2C566&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=1024%2C755&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grande will also be headlining the Manchester Pride festival this August. It is a sentimental moment, as she is returning to the city where the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing occured, and she will be representing a community that she obviously cares deeply for. However, regardless of her intentions, her name dominating a lineup meant to showcase queer talent, overshadowing the names of other performers, doubling ticket prices and attracting waves of fans —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether they are allies to the queer community or not —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is extremely problematic. Pride festivals are meant to be safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people of all ages and backgrounds, but tickets will likely go to those who are willing to pay the highest prices to see their idols, not to people who desperately need a place to feel accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Grande is not the only musician who has ever been accused of stealing a spotlight that belongs to a queer artist, but with her millions of fans and followers, her influence cannot go unnoticed. It did not go unnoticed when two straight women kissed on national television, only for cameras to immediately turn to see the reaction of Spears’s ex-boyfriend. It did not go unnoticed when Katy Perry sang about hoping her “boyfriend don’t mind it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTQ+ love is not a circus feat, it is not something to be gawked at and it is certainly not something to be appropriated by those who will never face the struggles that come with actually being a member of the queer community. Grande and all other straight artists can certainly be allies, but they cannot claim to support their queer following while using same-sex attraction as a music video prop, or taking up performance space that should belong to queer artists. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/","id":6270,"author":{"id":765,"name":"Adeline Barron-Merritt"},"related":[6269,6268,6267],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Misogyny Masquerades as Entertainment: Looking at Today’s Rap & Hip Hop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2019-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"What has made it so normalized for rappers, who lead today’s most popular musical genre, to generalize and sexualize women as much as they desire?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“You’re such a fuckin’ ho, I love it”</em> –<strong> Kanye West</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“She just bought a new ass but got the same boobs”</em> – <strong>Migos</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“New freak, had to cut my other lil’ bitch off”</em> – <strong>Rich the Kid</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss.

By the time I was in high school, I was digging through SoundCloud looking for new rappers in a very male-dominated space of music. I stumbled upon some of my favorite rappers like Kanye West, GoldLink and Kid Cudi, all of whom still remain among my most beloved musicians. I was a teenagr listening to women being called “hoes,” but it somehow didn’t matter to me —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it was just a part of the norm of a genre that I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chose</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be interested in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently attend rap concerts when I get the chance.

Should I be condemning the lyrical weaponry of almost every contemporary rapper and stand up for the rights that women deserve and are fighting for in our society? Am I a part of the perpetual cycle of objectification by allowing men to demean women and bolster their masculinity in the world of hip hop? I’m not entirely sure why I happily listen to this music while dismissing the way men talk about women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop is just supposed to be tough, right? The more badass you are the more you fit in — even the most revered of figures, Dr. Dre, has rapped about his aggression toward women. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst / But yo, I had to let my n*ggas fuck her first, yeah / Loaded up the forty-fo’, yo/Then I straight smoked the ho,” he raps in N.W.A’s “One Less Bitch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now, up-and-coming rappers who are molding a new era of rap, such as Kodak Black and Famous Dex, continue this detrimental image of women and have also been accused of abuse in their personal lives. All the while, these artists maintain millions of streams and vastly large fanbases – ones that even include those who fight for women’s rights and equality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women have always been a central focus of degenerative rap lyrics. Rappers are constantly telling women how to present themselves or act to their pleasure, portraying women as solely objects of their sexual gratification and depicting them as nothing more than “gold diggers” and “cheaters.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick Lamar, one of the most cherished rappers, has been criticized for saying, “Show me somethin’ natural like ass with some stretch marks.” While giving attention to natural female aesthetics other rappers dismiss, he continues to set certain expectations for women and instruct them how to express themselves to fit his own desire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hegemonic structure of hip hop has always made assertive the hyper-masculinity present to any listener. This cycle persists as men try to fit in with others by treating women as a marginality in the world of rap. Here, violence and mistreatment are OK. It’s OK to mumble slanders of how women are nothing more than vehicles for sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, being a man meant being powerful: having the most women, money and drugs. And it was difficult to move beyond this trend. Rap has now stretched so far past this, yet we still hold rappers’ words about women to the same standards as we did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, female rappers, who are already quite marginalized in this genre, seemingly play to the hyper-sexuality that male rappers depict women to have. From my perspective, Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, two of the most known female rappers of this generation, play into this trope. Instead of helping other women in the genre, they reinforce the idea of the limited female space in rap and have even gotten into physical and verbal fights with each other. This disappoints me, as these talented female rappers are overshadowing the beauty of having women in rap in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women should have an expanded space in rap music, and women should support each other in the genre instead of allowing for male domination to continue. In the past, when I heard unfavorable lyrics in rap music, I did not take it personally, as it just seemed like an established right for men to disrespect women in this context. I now think there should be a change in what is considered acceptable. Young girls should not be listening to their favorite rappers call women “hoes” and their favorite songs shouldn’t be about “bitches.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, Famous Dex, Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar were all in my Spotify 2018 top streamed songs playlist. And honestly, that probably won’t change next year. By listening to these artists, I am not supporting rappers’ misogyny.

As a child of the early 2000s, this was wonderful – iPods hadn’t hit the scene yet and it was as close as I could get at the time. This also meant that I had access to my parents’ massive CD collection, taking random mixes from my dad’s car, or borrowing the new music that my mom had just bought from Best Buy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent quality time with the music that piqued my interest most, developing my personal tastes quite early on. Music didn’t have a face, only a voice –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it spoke to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were many gems that I was lucky to discover in the treasure trove of music available to me,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything from Dave Brubeck, to Michael McDonald, and Michael Franks — oh, and of course, the Beatles. My dad, in particular, exposed me to music that I wasn’t supposed to like at that age. I knew that for a fact. But I didn’t realize I also wasn’t supposed to like that music because I was a black girl. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My acute realization of this fact came when I got to middle school and traded my CD player in for an iPod when I turned 11. After school, friends would peek over at the small screen of my most prized possession and wonder, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is she listening to?”</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black girls aren’t supposed to like guitars. Black girls aren’t supposed to like music that’s for white people. Black girls don’t listen to bands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After these realizations, music became even more personal to me. Of course, I sang along to Top 40 hits by Lady Gaga and Beyonce in the mall with my friends, and fell in love with Drake as he rose up the pop-hop ranks on the radio. But the songs on my iPod – the songs for old people, the songs for white people –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I kept those mostly to myself. I reveled in the time I got to spend watching music videos on my shared home laptop and putting on my earphones while nestled in the backseat during long drives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High school came around, and I was equipped with my own computer and a smartphone, also known as the greatest tools for music discovery ever invented. I searched, I dug for more and I downloaded an embarrassing amount of illegal songs from websites that were likely on the FBI’s radar. Mixed CDs with handwritten tracklists were the best gifts I knew how to give, and were reserved for the people I cared about most. I leaned into finding music that I loved –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely as a means to somehow find myself too. It became a hobby and the thing that made me happiest at the end of another day as a teenage girl. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86527\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1777453890\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86525\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86527\" data-attachment-id=\"86527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/black-girls-like-guitars-too/unnamed-1-27/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=595%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"595,490\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=250%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=595%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86527 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4-250x206.jpg?resize=250%2C206\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?resize=250%2C206&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first favorite bands were Coldplay, Radiohead and Nirvana. All three of these bands are basic fare to people well-versed in pop culture, but can be life-changing to a young person. I found more bands, posted links to music videos on Tumblr and Facebook and talked about my favorite new songs with anyone who would listen. Sometimes, I was called white-washed, a try-hard and a number of other stupid things I thankfully can’t remember anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this didn’t happen often;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t bullied for my music taste. I am not claiming to be the victim of some form of musical racism. But I constantly felt that I was trying to be figured out. The music taste I had developed, coupled with the way I spoke and the types of boys I had crushes on, was cause for confusion. Eventually, I too became confused by myself and wondered why, to most people, my identity didn’t match my tastes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second half of my high school years, I found Vampire Weekend, Tame Impala and Mac DeMarco –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a group which I now affectionately refer to as Baby’s First Indie Bands. By this time, I was fully settled into liking “white” music, or whatever else made me stop and listen. If nothing else, I knew what I wanted to hear, which was very important in me becoming fully, outwardly myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the deep-dive into music history during my early college years came an important realization: black people had an instrumental role in the creation of rock and roll. Some of music’s most important figures were black – and had white listeners. Chuck Berry was one of </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/paul-mccartney-on-chuck-berry-he-was-a-magician-111984/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Beatles’</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> primary inspirations and </span><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UaWJ8Kd2pG4C&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elton John</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be considered Little Richard’s closest counterpart. This was powerful knowledge: proof that my love for music with guitars is perhaps natural. Black girls like guitars, and people that look like us play them too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embraced my love of music that contrasted with who I was supposed to be in the minds of others and moved forward. Now, house shows in Isla Vista are one of the places I feel most comfortable. Most importantly, I’ve made writing about music of all kinds my focus. Music belongs to everyone, not only in parts deemed to be fit for certain groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever makes me feel, whatever I choose to be for me, can be mine. If you limit yourself in consuming any sort of creative expression, based on preconceived notions of who it is created for, it is a blatant disservice to the art and to yourself. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

number of Isla Vista’s local bands over the last couple years, I’ve found it’s difficult to attach myself to their music, as members frequently graduate and leave their bandmates behind. However, Careless Cub just released their first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, thus solidifying their mark on the I.V. music scene in a succinct eight-song declaration of the trio’s talents. The three-piece includes Grant Chesin, a fourth-year English major on lead vocals and guitar, Andrew Becker, a fourth-year chemical engineering major on drums and backup vocals and, finally, Ray Muhlenkamp, a third-year computer science and German double major on bass (who also used to play in The Mallards!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-described as “singer-songwriter surf rock,” Careless Cub and their new album have the distinct Isla Vista sound of melodic tunes mixed in with faster, upbeat rhythms and lyrics expressing contemplation of life, young love and growing up. To create this sound, the band describes having strong musical influences from Father John Misty, The Growlers, Courtney Barnett and The Eagles. However, the band acknowledges their changing sound as they try to figure out which genre they belong to through different styles of music. “I think it’s hard to say we’re a certain genre. It’s not like an egotistical thing; it’s more just like, here we’ll play a punk song, there an alt-rock song, a vibey surf rock song,” Chesin says, “We’re just finding our way through the music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stands out not merely for its musical elements but also for the production and sound quality of the tracks. In an interview with the band, I inquired about the recording process and, to my surprise, another I.V. musician was the one to thank for the polished debut. “Alec Luttrell from Odd Army was the guy who mixed, tracked and mastered everything, and the reason it sounds so high-quality is completely because of him. He did an amazing job,” Muhlenkamp said. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most of the tracks have a mellow, house party vibe, “Hemingway Lemonade,” “Skipping Town” and “As a Kid” are the ones to look out for. In my brief talk with Careless Cub, they explained how “Hemingway Lemonade” has definitely been a fan favorite since the album’s release on Feb. 1 — and it’s clear as to why. Classic alt-rock guitar strumming starts the song, calling for listeners far and wide to join Careless Cub on their journey through college in the fun and daring environment that is Isla Vista. For the most part, “Hemingway Lemonade” is a relaxed, chill song that anyone with an ounce of rhythm in their bodies can sway and bob their heads to. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86090\" style=\"width: 1009px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2026532933\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86089\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86090\" data-attachment-id=\"86090\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/a-word-with-careless-club-on-flophouse-palace/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=999%2C1005&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,1005\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=888%2C893&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86090\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=888%2C893\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=768%2C773&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Careless Cub</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Skipping Town” has a personal tone, as the first lyrics literally begin with advice from singer Chesin’s supposed therapist. This song then describes the kind of romantic insecurity that naturally comes with being in love at this young age and lays out a plan for the protagonist to skip town and start over in an emotional, alt-rock college ballad. “I’ll come up with a melody and lyrics and then I’ll play it to them [Becker and Muhlenkamp] and they’ll go ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ and then they start building their parts,” Chesin described the songwriting process. “I’d say especially ‘Family Tree’ and ‘Yikes a Daisies’ have almost become entirely their songs with how much they added.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chesin cited “Monterey Bay” and “I Can’t Believe You Fell in Love with Me” as his favorite songs, while Becker and Muhlenkamp both agreed on “Never Coming Home,” which they cheekily described as the one “that has the least amount of listens right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to asking about where the songwriting came from and what their favorite songs were, I had to know — what does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually mean? Well, according to front man Chesin: “The name ‘Flophouse Palace’ is from the book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannery Row</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I thought it’s such a funny oxymoron.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Flophouse’ is defined as essentially people who stay there for a couple days and trash it, and that’s kind of Isla Vista,” he explained. “It’s like sometimes you feel ‘Oh my god, I’m in a dream land,’ to ‘This is the worst place.’ Also, I live at this place called the Palace, which isn’t a real palace, but it’s just kind of a play on that.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want more of Careless Cub?

As the night grew cold and music began to blast, Noise Complaint set the bar once again for hardcore metal enthusiasts everywhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noise Complaint is a three-piece metal band composed of Jake Morenc (lead vocalist and third-year mechanical engineering student), Radean Anvari (guitarist and pre-med second-year) and Matthew Hernandez (bassist and history fourth-year). Former Mallards drummer Morenc inspired the band’s fitting name after attracting over 100 noise complaints from the local community with his drum kit over the course of his freshman year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Living at the Mallards’, I would put my drum kit in a laundry cart and roll that shit up the elevator to the rooftop where I broke it down for the neighbors every other night,” Morenc said. “Starting out, I probably dealt with plus-100 interactions with the local police because of those inhibitions. Since then we’ve embraced and encouraged that vibe.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, their set was loud as hell, and a few naysayers took issue with the noise. Some people just cannot appreciate good metal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of Artsweek’s own have had the pleasure of witnessing the magic happen firsthand on more than one occasion, and the crowds speak for themselves. Free booze, heavy metal and boatloads of energy, in that particular order, is always enough to get even the lazy and lethargic on their feet. But Noise Complaint goes above and beyond the average band of mediocre musicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I mention the free booze? That’s right. Coors galore. Every head in the pit is justifiably banging to the hardcore beats of heavy metal as soon as Matthew Hernandez rips his first lick on bass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What separates this crew from the rest is pure, white-hot dedication. Jake and his bandmates were setting up their stage, their equipment and the pit as early as 2 p.m. for their latest gig — around eight gut-wrenching hours before the show was set to begin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our worst shows are other people’s best,” one member modestly said. But it’s true — the group clearly puts everything they have into creating the best possible experience for their crowds at every show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We seriously give it our all and the audience ends up genuinely loving it,” Anvari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band jokingly compares themselves to Migos, whom we all know and love, and as far as raw talent and passion goes, that stretch isn’t far from the truth. A more accurate resemblance might be found between Noise Complaint and Linkin Park, whom the former often looks to for cover songs and inspiration. While these comparisons certainly help paint a legendary picture, Noise Complaint is uniquely their own, and they make sure you know it as they grind out every set list with a grit that belongs to the pros. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking for a slow, easy night indoors, maybe this isn’t the scene for you. Then again, even notorious heavy metal haters who generally don’t connect with hardcore rock ‘n’ roll reportedly show up time and time again to get that metal buzz, feeding off the energy of the fans and the band. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more info on Noise Complaint’s upcoming shows, be sure to like and follow them on

id=\"caption-attachment-85653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Dissect”<i> </i>is what music nerds think they sound like when they talk about their favorite albums. This is how I’d describe Cole Cuchna’s serialized music podcast, which takes one album per season and, quite literally, dissects it track by track, lyric by lyric.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show has four seasons so far: seasons one and two, respectively, are Kendrick Lamar’s <i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i>and Kanye West’s <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>; season three dives into Frank Ocean’s early career and analysis of his second album <i>Blonde</i>; and season four, dubbed a mini-series, explores Ms. Lauryn Hill’s <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </i>upon its 20th anniversary<i>. </i>The common threads between these albums are obvious: modern classics by enigmatic black artists that are not commonly analyzed through an academic lens. It’s quite amazing listening to the way that Cuchna pays attention to detail with the heart of a fan and the ear of a scholar.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It’s clear that Cuchna is a hardworking guy — he created “Dissect” while working full-time as creative director for a coffee company in Sacramento. The show was initially a passion project — he wrote, recorded and edited the show with most of the free time he had, somehow maintaining his packed schedule for the first two seasons. Then, “Dissect”<i> </i>was picked up by Spotify, and Cuchna was able to turn it into his primary gig. This gave way to season three, the Frank Ocean season, which put “Dissect” on a much wider radar.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">The show topped the <i>New York Times’ </i>top podcasts of 2018 list, sharing coveted space with true crime and talk shows. Before “Dissect,” I thought of podcasts as time for listening to news and murder mysteries — because music podcasts never got quite deep enough. “Dissect”<i> </i>is the show that I needed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Cuchna has always had a deep interest in music. He recounts his love for the music of the mid-nineties that was popular during his adolescence; he remembers listening to Motown and the Beatles as a child in his parents’ home. Then, he started buying his own albums and “gravitated toward hip-hop, then rock music,” he told me. Similar to many young music fans, he consumed whatever he could — from jazz, to classical, to electronica. He went to Sacramento State and got a music composition degree, which cultivated an academic voice that largely influences the tone of “Dissect.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Each episode takes a song and goes into technical details of phrasing, chord progressions and musical metaphor. That’s not to say that someone who isn’t well-versed in music theory couldn’t follow along — Cuchna’s patient voice can guide even the most musically inept listener to understanding why an artist chose to use a minor chord instead of a major seventh.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There’s a great deal of time and care that goes into crafting each season of “Dissect,” but most of all, there’s a lot of listening. “I will take a general look at the lyrics and play through the music on piano, just to see if there’s any connections there,” Cuchna says. He plays through the album on repeat while writing the content for each episode and listens to each song anywhere from 10 to 20 times. Then, “after that it’s just pointing out the most interesting musical features followed by a line-by-line analysis of the lyrics,” he explains.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">White men analyzing black music is a huge part of modern-day music discourse — and there always seems to be room for one more voice to add to the chatter. But Cuchna comes from a place of love, a place of respect that could not possibly be faked. He admits that discomfort used to come up sometimes for him when considering his position in this dichotomy, but it has faded with time. “I’ve learned so much, particularly about the black experience, through examining these works,” he imparts. “I wouldn’t trade that for anything.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There’s no sense of overstepping boundaries when listening Cuchna’s analysis of such deeply black works. Perhaps it’s a little awkward listening to him explain black slang to his audience, but that’s okay — it’s something that he is very good at.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The best episode of “Dissect”<i> </i>is a 40-minute feature from the Frank Ocean season, covering <i>Blonde </i>tracks “Skyline To” and “Self Control.” It’s a beautiful montage of Ocean’s possible inspirations — none are definitive, but Cuchna makes sure not to leave out any possibilities. He covers obscure 80s tracks and Robert Frost poems to chart what could have been Ocean’s thought process while writing <i>Blonde </i>and breaks down why these songs, “Self Control” in particular, are so moving. He plays each arpeggiating chord that makes up the soul of the song, breaking down the gorgeous melody that Ocean sings and why it makes us so damn emotional every single time.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Music is a glimpse into that unknown, an impression of the enigmatic, the shadow of a figure just out of sight,” Cuchna concludes at the end of his analysis – fitting for music as ethereal as Ocean’s.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Talking about music for a living is a dream job, which is at least half the reason why I listen to “Dissect”<i> </i>— I become more educated and inspired, listening to someone talk about some of the most important albums of my generation. Cuchna is one of the best at it, giving much deserved credit to albums outside of the traditional scholarly conversations around music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">How does a person make a passion for music their full-time job? “Do it for yourself. Don’t worry about results at first,” he advises. “Just get to doing the damn thing.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Her music acts as an escape route from the heavily engineered hits that dominate the pop music landscape. The Steve Lacy-produced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crush </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EP catalogues Lenae’s reflective experiences, from that of the suppression of romance to the inherent fear of commitment in the confines of a modern dating era, where short attention spans lead to the demise of a relationship. Lenae’s compelling persona throughout her discography permeates into her live shows, where she becomes a celestial wave of R&amp;B and soul. On Wednesday, Lenae commanded the crowd with glittery performances about unattainable crushes at The Hub for a show sponsored by A.S. Program Board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nineteen-year-old Lenae has cracked open the matrix of writing intricate storylines about unreciprocated sentiments and bottled feelings for an online romance. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us are mortified by our 19-year-old writing efforts, whether they be in song format, diary entries or essays dealing with the psychology of online dating. Lenae flips the mediocrity of our teenage achievements on its head; she exceeds a maturity that resemble prodigal endeavors. The 16-minute EP is a compilation of Lenae’s powerful vocal artistry and Lacy’s changing groove. Lenae’s breezy riffs are emblematic of what Lionel Richie would describe as “easy as Sunday morning.” The cross-pollination of Lenae’s vocals and Lacy’s guitar plucking conjures the feeling of sunshine on your face. Lenae receives praise from fellow multi-talented songstresses SZA and Noname, so much so that Lenae was brought as an opening act for both of the artists’ tours.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85098\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1179597791\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85096\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85098\" data-attachment-id=\"85098\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/artist-to-watch-ravyn-lenae/unnamed-68/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=900%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85098\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85098\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of YouTube</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crush </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EP introduces the hypnotic chorus of “The Night Song” — “Hair down, feeling alright, got my edges on tight, it’s a party tonight,” Lenae sings in a sweet cadence that has you in an instant trance.

Much like Ms. Lauryn Hill’s ability to utilize music as a meditative space for love and self-actualization in the early 90s, Lenae uses her lyrics to reflect on her identity and genuine romantic expressions of the 2010s. Lenae’s unabashed outlook on love that is not yet tainted by the self-deprecating insecurities of one’s early to mid-20s is refreshing. She provides a sense of relief and peppers in some optimism, a relief that we, too, will find ourselves dancing around because we are in love, whether that be with a partner or just coming to terms with loving ourselves. Artists like Lenae are the definitive forces of the decade, as they continuously bring polished, inventive sounds to the forefront. The ascension into stardom coupled with the bold outline of her name on a festival lineup is on the horizon in 2019 for the powerhouse that is Ravyn Lenae.</span></p>\n<div

Think about how the music made you feel upon first listen and how those sounds have resonated in some form or another as time has elapsed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in conjunction with recollections of the music enclosed within your favorite records, you also recalled the artwork which represents these collections of sound. From the Beatles’ <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, to The Velvet Underground’s <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em>, all great albums exist behind their respective artwork.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Dewey Bryan Saunders, one of today’s most innovative and established graphic designers who often operates within the niche realm that is cover art. Working alongside figures such as Anderson .Paak, Lil Uzi Vert and Chronixx, Saunders has been steadily navigating through the art world with consistent and captivating work for years now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up with interests rooted in music and skateboarding, Saunders was always attracted to art.

His style is simultaneously classic and modern; hand-cut items from vintage sources such as old National Geographic or Playboy magazines are reworked into an iconically distinct visual concoction.</p>\n<p>The creative didn’t stop studying art after college, however. Saunders is constantly refining his craft and developing a better eye for the nuanced detail that is so integral to his artwork.</p>\n<p>His day-to-day routine typically consists of early caffeinated mornings of reading and design.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been trying to read a lot more lately to keep the mind sharp and to inform concepts in my art practice,” he said.</p>\n<p>Saunders recently made a move from Philadelphia, Pa. to Los Angeles, Calif.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the main difference about living on the west coast is my access to different sorts of source material. I order some things from the internet, but I love the old fashioned dig for good materials, and there are so many weekend flea markets and bookstores, I’ve been able to rapidly expand my printed matter collection,” he explained.</p>\n<p>While based in Philadelphia, Saunders began designing cover art for local musicians. One of his formative projects was in collaboration with a local indie band called Brown Recluse. From there, he continued to work with other artists and slowly built his portfolio.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82701\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"661672428\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82701\" data-attachment-id=\"82701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/dbs-sp4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=2048%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DBS SP4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=888%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-82701 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=888%2C238\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=768%2C206&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=1024%2C275&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>While you may not be familiar with Saunders, you’ve likely come across his artwork at some point. One of his most notable ventures was with rapper/singer/songwriter Anderson .Paak.</p>\n<p>Saunders connected with .Paak through Twitter. At the time, he was making portraits of rappers on Instagram and tagging them in his posts. Some of these portraits were even reposted by artists like Drake and Mac Miller. Nonetheless, .Paak eventually reached out to Saunders after stumbling upon artwork of some of his hip hop contemporaries. This relationship later blossomed into a poster series for a handful of .Paak’s concerts, then cover art for singles and albums.</p>\n<p>For <em>Malibu</em>, the musician’s sophomore LP behind the moniker “Anderson .Paak,” Saunders worked under the creative direction of designer Cory Gomberg. Together, the two teamed up to conceptualize the sounds of the critically acclaimed record into a visual manifestation of .Paak’s aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The cover art for <em>Malibu</em> is fascinating. The intricacies enveloped within the 1×1 picture are both chaotic and organized. Saturated in orange sunlight, Anderson .Paak sits at a glossy upright piano as foamy swells of ocean water and an assortment of miscellaneous items float around him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82700\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"916128855\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82700\" data-attachment-id=\"82700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/ap_malibu_cover_flat_ap_web-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82700\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cover art for Anderson .Paak’s album <em>Malibu</em>, Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>But, it would be a crime to think of Saunders only through the lens of his cover art. The creator is much more than that — he’s an artistic powerhouse who maintains ties to a ubiquity of creative spaces. Saunders is an illustrator, a designer, sometimes a musician. He releases artwork on social media sites daily and connects with his fans and supporters online. Saunders is undoubtedly the most active, accessible and engaging artist on social media I have ever encountered.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it is refreshing for people to know that I am a real person and by being super consistent and responsive, it makes people trust me as a brand,” Saunders said. “I like to have people kind of follow along my activities too, and it’s even good for family that lives all around the country that wants to know what I’ve been up to recently.”</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that the artist’s success didn’t evolve overnight. Saunders grew up in an age without Instagram. He promoted his craft by hand, mailing out flyers and samples of his work to anybody he could reach. Analogously, he’s had to make some sacrifices along the way.</p>\n<p>“I think sticking to a freelance lifestyle and taking a long time to develop a personal style was a bit of a sacrifice. Eventually that route worked out for me, but it was a long journey to where I am now and it still feels like the beginning,” Saunders elaborated. “I am really fortunate to be in the position of a graphic designer with a personal style that is desirable right now, and it was a tremendous amount of work — a supernatural effort to reach this level.”</p>\n<p>Saunders slices printed source material the same way a hip hop producer would sample a song. He operates meticulously with a focused and pragmatic demeanor.</p>\n<p>But Saunders isn’t done yet. He recently landed a promotional campaign with RayBan and is currently juggling a myriad of personal and commercial projects. And while his world may be ever-changing, a few things remain constant for Dewey Saunders: coffee, reading and design.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82702\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877602953\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82702\" data-attachment-id=\"82702\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/rb_round_reference/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"RB_Round_REFERENCE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82702\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RB_Round_REFERENCE.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Promotional artwork for RayBan, Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p><em>For more artwork from Saunders follow him @deweysaunders on Twitter or Instagram.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

third-year Julia Feldman might seem like a typical college kid, and on some levels she is. She studies, has an internship and frequently worries about her future. But Feldman isn’t just concerned with finding the perfect job in the right city like some of us might be. Through her pursuits of music, feminism and environmentalism, Feldman is trying to save the world.</p>\n<p>At age 17, Feldman found herself at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York, representing a new generation of young women making a splash. Invited for raising thousands of dollars for the Malala Fund in her high school club, Girls Learn International, Feldman recalls feeling empowered by her company in New York.</p>\n<p>“To be around so many women from all over the world who would go to such great lengths for their rights and for the women of their countries, it was really beautiful,” she explained.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A singer-songwriter since the seventh grade, Feldman wanted to use this inspiration to compose a record offering support for women and girls. Out of this desire came “Wolves,” a blistering, rocked-out anthem that encourages women not to withhold their ambitions because of anyone else. “It’s about how no matter what you do or what you say or wear, you are doing it for yourself… And there’s a whole squadron of women standing behind you,” said Feldman.</p>\n<p>Performing the song with her band BNTLY, “Wolves” became a crucial piece in helping the group land a distribution deal with Bungalow and Universal. Now, with shows planned around established clubs across Los Angeles and five more singles coming out this year, BNTLY is quickly emerging as band that’s here to stay.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82532\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"102983688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82532\" data-attachment-id=\"82532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>Yet, BNTLY and feminist activism only make up a portion of Feldman’s activities. In addition to writing and performing music, Feldman is a passionate environmental studies major at UCSB. She is currently an intern at the sustainability program on campus, leading the organization efforts of the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, which will host thousands of students from college campuses around the country later this year. Additionally, Feldman runs a blog discussing fashion and how it relates to sustainability and health. Although music is Feldman’s first priority, she is open to pursuing environmental activism as a backup career.</p>\n<p>This work ethic and diversity of interests does not go unnoticed: “Julia is a mixture of warmth, love, generosity and compassion while also being one of the most determined, focused and hardworking people I know,” said housemate and third-year art major Pilar Herrera. “She is a glass-half-full kind of lady and isn’t easily discouraged.”</p>\n<p>This view is echoed by her brother and BNTLY guitarist Adam Feldman. “She has always been able to multitask at a high level, and it’s no surprise that she is able to handle school, work, music and life, period. That’s just always been Julia,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The children of a singing and accordion-playing mother and a multi-talented musician of a father with ties to the industry<u>,</u> the Feldman children began their musical education in the Valley of Los Angeles from a young age. “[Our parents] decided that my brother and I would learn an instrument no matter what,” said Julia. “They started us with guitar, but then I found out I could sing, so I really took off with that while Adam took off with guitar.”</p>\n<p>Naturally, the two began writing songs together. When Adam was 13 and Julia 11, the two started sitting down together to collaborate. What started out as a way to kill time at home quickly progressed into a serious hobby within the first year. Years later they’ve refined their writing process, collaborating as the main songwriters for BNTLY.</p>\n<p>“Our process is super organic. No frills, no nothing,” said Adam. “One of us has an idea, whether it be melodic or lyrical, and we just build the song from the ground up, lyrics and music at the same time so they fit perfectly.”</p>\n<p>Listening to BNTLY, this process can be easily traced. On “Wolves,” Julia’s soulful vocals weave around the same melody as Adam’s roaring, wah-wah guitar riff. Adding tricky licks and vocal runs, Adam and Julia add a layer of complexity to the seemingly rudimentary foundation of the song.</p>\n<p>The Feldman siblings also credit their musical prowess to their father’s teachings on various musical genres. “He would drive around and give us little music history lessons,” said Julia. “We would start out in the ’60s with classic rock, blues and funk.” Julia acknowledges that these early lessons helped her hone the style of her biggest influences, which include Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder and Sly and the Family Stone.</p>\n<p>Adam also believes that the fact that Julia wasn’t just focused on vocally driven pop music is what makes her so fun to listen to and collaborate with. “She understands that she is a part of a larger entity, making for a much more cohesive sound over all,” Adam elaborated. “It is a type of musical maturity that some vocalists never get to in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Constantly exploring new ways to empower women and improve her abilities as a singer, Julia is looking to diversify her influences by looking at more female performers. Julia has taken a liking to neo-soul and praises the work of the female artists Kehlani, H.E.R., NAO and Lianne La Havas. Julia has even made a point of covering female artists in Isla Vista including a scathing rendition of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” with her old band Poster Child.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82533\" style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"738330862\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82533\" data-attachment-id=\"82533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=1080%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>While two of the band members of Poster Child have since graduated and moved to San Francisco and Los Angeles to begin professions in chemistry and accounting respectively, Julia fondly recalls the Isla Vista music scene. “One time spring quarter we played at my drummer Shane’s backyard on DP. We pushed two beer die tables up against the fence, and that was the stage,” said Julia. “We used to pack his backyard with people, and others from the street would come and listen. I talk to friends who go to college in other places, and they can’t do anything like that.”</p>\n<p>It is likely, however, that Julia’s passion for music and her endeavors in environmental justice and gender equality might not be able to co-exist forever. “It is interesting hearing about how her busy-ness is split between two different identities, that of a student and that of an aspiring musician,” said Herrera. “For how much she is doing, and given that I see a lot of the behind-the-scenes-Julia, her work ethic and positive attitude are seriously so impressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite constantly seeming to exhibit this positivity, even Julia feels the pressure of the future. “I’m so scared that I’m going to wake up when I’m 30 and have this job that I don’t care about and just be like, ‘Oh my god what happened?’”</p>\n<p>For now, Julia has one primary goal, common through each of her interests: She wants to make a change. “I feel some of the heavy shit in the world,” she said. “I just want to have a purpose and leave a mark in a positive way.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/","id":6268,"author":{"id":666,"name":"Daniel Carroll"},"related":[6267,6266,6265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mt.

Eddy was at the Bay Area music scene staple 924 Gilman in Berkeley in 2016.  Even in their beginnings as a band, they were playing alongside established East Bay heroes SWMRS in a venue made famous by the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Green Day, and they were already carrying with them a sense of community in their performances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the band’s show with Heyrocco and King Shelter at the Velvet Jones on Feb. 23, I had the chance to meet up with vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jakob Armstrong, lead guitarist Enzo Malaspina, bassist and backing vocalist Kevin Judd and drummer Chris Malaspina to discuss changing names, adding members and self assigning genres all while scarfing down pizza in the dimly lit confines of Uncle Rocco’s Famous New York Pizza.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling the band’s origin, Chris, “Jakob released songs on SoundCloud, and I hit him up a week later. I just saw him somewhere and I was like holy shit, he released these unbelievable songs, let’s get a band together.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was this original release by Armstrong under the name Jakob Danger that led to what is today known as Mt. Eddy.  Looking for a third member to round off the duo, Chris brought in his brother Enzo who juggled bass and guitar duties, often switching instruments halfway through sets.  Still under the name Jakob Danger and seeking a more complete feel, the band brought in Judd, asking him to join while under the impression that he actually knew how to play bass. And with the long sought after final addition, the band solidified its roster and recorded its debut album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chroma</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a collective effort under their newly established moniker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although producing a modest crowd turnout at the Velvet Jones, what was lost in numbers was made up in passion. With loyal fans singing along to easily accessible hooks and the entire crowd head-bobbing to the smooth listening that is much of the band’s appeal, Mt. Eddy created an infectious community, making the concertgoers experience less about watching and more about participating.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthems like “Song and Fury” allowed those unfamiliar to the track to quickly catch on to its lyrics and sing along. Heavier songs like title track “Chroma” seamlessly switched from playfully shouted choruses to Malaspina’s drum-dominated breakdowns all too suited for the crowd’s heavy mosh pits. Perhaps it is this dynamic nature that makes the band so appealing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the songwriting, the band said, “It’s  mostly Jakob, but we change the parts for our respective instruments.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performing two unreleased tracks from a three-track EP set to release on March 11, Armstrong said to the crowd: “We’re gonna try to play a new song that Kevin learned on the drive here. So be gentle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each member’s personal presence on both songs is clear, with one track relying on a riff-soaked chorus led by Enzo and another with isolated vocals highlighting the complementary contrast of the rugged and the soft from Armstrong and Judd, respectively.  With the expressive drum stylings of jazz-trained drummer Chris, it’s no wonder why every song feels so complete and every fan seems so loyal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between the gifts, pleas for their setlist and screams from adoring fans, the relatively new band seems unphased. As for Armstrong, familiarity with fame and big names in the music industry is something he has lived with his whole life. With an album mixed by Grammy-winning audio engineer Chris Dugan, who Armstrong merely refers to as “my Dad’s friend,” it’s clear Armstrong’s background let him get his foot in the door of the music industry, and his independent musical talent allowed that door to stay open for future projects.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this talent that created enough chaos to make the half-full Velvet Jones feel packed to the brim. With spilled drinks slicking the floor, sweaty faces shining in the light and surprise pushes from spur of the moment mosh pits, Mt. Eddy proved all you need is the music to forget yourself and enjoy the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With half the band in high school and the other half in college, juggling touring and school has proved increasingly difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all starting to miss more and more school to play shows,” Judd explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the impending release of a new EP, it seems opportunity for touring will only grow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branching out from touring with many of the Bay Area bands they are most associated with, Armstrong explained, “In Oakland we play the same venues with the same general bands. We just ask our friend’s bands to play. Now we’re submitting for different tours with different bands.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking towards the future and contemplating the ever-subjective concept of genre, Armstrong said, “We’re writing all sorts of stuff … I think we’re heading towards surf rock but we’re also not … We’re definitely not straight punk.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some time went by until they all resolved, “We don’t know. That’s the answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still in the beginning of their career, Mt. Eddy has a lot of time to find that answer, and as long as they keep putting out music, we’ll have time to listen.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/","id":5724,"author":{"id":665,"name":"Jake Einsiedl"},"related":[5723,5722,5721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB in Sound: Radio Stations to Look Out For","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Radio-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Radio-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"If the struggle to rediscover decent radio stations sounds familiar, this article will put you in good hands.

Below, you’ll find a short guide to the hottest FM radio sounds broadcasting near UCSB.</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong>. KCRW 88.7 is the funkiest radio station broadcasting in the greater Santa Barbara area. 88.7 combines soft and personal with absolutely groovy finds. Most of the songs broadcasting are songs that I’ve never heard before, but they have great rhythms and melodies.

KRTH 101.1 is sure to play oldies that you know and will want to sing along to. To give you a taste of their playlist, in just the last 30 minutes they’ve played Elton John’s “Bennie and the Jets<em>,” </em>Men at Work’s “Down Under” and A Flock of Seagulls’s “I Ran [So Far Away]”. <em> </em>If you’re looking to hear a few favorites and expand your collection of oldies, add KRTH to your presets.</p>\n<p>This station is perfect for you if you like Depeche Mode, Talking Heads or Fleetwood Mac.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong>. KLOS 95.5 has a great collection of rock sounds. They typically aren’t repetitive, which is a great aspect if you’re interested in committing to tuning in to a radio station. This station is big on artists that play guitar heavily. If you’re interested in the rock n’ roll oldies that KRTH offers but want a little more variety, tune into 95.5.</p>\n<p><em>Notable Segments: </em>Jonesy’s Jukebox: punk rock star and guitarist for the Sex Pistols. Steve Jones hosts a rock n’ roll segment weekdays 12 p.m. – 2 p.m.</p>\n<p>This station is perfect for you if you like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Violent Femmes or Electric Light Orchestra.</p>\n<p><strong>4</strong>. Spin 106.3 is on this list because what’s a radio guide without at least one hip hop station? This station plays light beats and fresh mixes. Spin FM will play a mix of popular hip hop hits alongside classics and a few fresh finds. I chose 106.3 for its more relaxed theme and cached selections, but if you’re into pure trap music (Migos, Lil Uzi Vert, Cardi B) then 95.9 might be up your alley.</p>\n<p>This station is perfect for you if you like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, A Tribe Called Quest or Sir Mix-a-Lot.</p>\n<p><strong>5</strong>. KCBS 93.1 is a simple choice for fans of alternative music. If you’re from the greater Los Angeles area, you may already be familiar with 93.1, more famously known as Jack FM. Jack FM plays a range of alternative songs, from throwbacks to more recent hits. 93.1 is known for its engagement with listeners through their sense of humor and topical commentary. Jack FM is a station that plays rock hits like KLOS, but leans more toward the alternative side of music.</p>\n<p>This station is perfect for you if you like Tom Petty, Nirvana, The Killers or MGMT.</p>\n<p><strong>6</strong>. KTYD 99.9, because one rock station just isn’t enough. KTYD is a Santa Barbara-based radio station that plays the heaviest rock music. KLOS plays more soft rock compared to KTYD, and while Jack FM’s rock selection is mostly alternative, KTYD plays more active rock. Examples of active rock include Green Day, The Who and  Metallica.</p>\n<p>This station is perfect for you if you like AC/DC, Black Sabbath or The Eagles.</p>\n<p>Next time you don’t know what to play when you’re driving to State or studying in the library, give one of these stations a listen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.
