With this movie, we get to watch Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) make his big comeback in Hollywood stardom after struggling to find decent work as an aging, one-dimensional actor. Intermingled with this fictional narrative is the appearance of actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), whose brutal murder history gets rewritten in a satisfying yet extremely violent way. While Tarantino weaves in lots of true, historical moments in the film, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is ultimately an exaggerated, daydream version of an idealized 1960s Hollywood; one in which second chances are given and justice is served to those who deserve it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>2. Spider-Man: Far From Home</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off: thank goodness this movie was filmed before the whole Sony and Disney debacle. While Marvel superhero movies can often feel cheesy and unoriginal, “Spider-Man: Far From Home” presented audiences with just the perfect amount of cheese, a brilliant cast and a crazy nail-biting twist ending that no one saw coming. As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) decides to take a break from his superhero duties and enjoy his school trip abroad to Europe, he befriends Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) and finds himself, you guessed it, fighting crime once again in his Spider-Man suit. Besides Holland and Gyllenhaal, Zendaya also shone bright in this film as her character, Mary Jane, finally got more screen time and even helped Spider-Man discover who the villain was. Overall, “Spider-Man: Far From Home” is one of the few superhero movies to come out this year that I’m confident any person could enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Toy Story 4</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was this movie necessary? No. Was this movie fun to watch and enough to satisfy your nostalgic need to cling onto iconic childhood characters? Yes. “Toy Story 4” captures another toy adventure sans Andy and reunites Woody with his love interest, Bo Peep — it’s that simple. Unlike “Toy Story 3,” the villain here turns out to be quite redeemable and even gets her own happily-ever-after ending. There’s not much to say about this movie, much like “Toy Story 3,” as it doesn’t measure up to the first two in the Toy Story film franchise but is still entertaining to watch. At this point, the Toy Story legacy has nothing new or special to offer its original audience besides these sequels that seem to do nothing but remind you how old you are.</span></p>\n<p><strong>4. Child’s Play</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I absolutely despise this recent rise in reboots and remakes, I felt this new version of “Child’s Play” held some kind of originality by altering the origin story of Chucky and thus changing the personality of this iconic horror character. Rather than just repeating the exact same story in the boring and overly-CGI fashion that most reboots tend to do, director Lars Klevberg instead gave horror fans an alternative version of the beloved Chucky doll. When compared to the original 1988 classic, this 2019 Chucky has a much more friendly approach to his murderous activities. Chucky simply just wants to be best friends with his child owner, and is willing to take out anyone who gets in the way of this mission. Although this version of “Child’s Play” is playing off of the success of the original franchise, I can at least admire the creativity that went into changing the essence of Chucky, both in terms of personality and looks. Plus, who doesn’t want to see a horror movie with Aubrey Plaza in it?</span></p>\n<p><strong>5. Avengers: Endgame</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a movie that’s three hours long and filled with so many beloved characters, I just expected to leave the theater feeling more impressed, which is why “Avengers: Endgame” is so low on this list. In the crossover of the century, “Avengers: Endgame” shows all our favorite Marvel heroes working together at a second chance of defeating Thanos through a confusing use of time travel. Overall, this movie seemed to fail in its own inconsistencies and overly-cheesy moments. Why does Iron Man get a whole funeral and Black Widow doesn’t? What does that mean for the past Captain America films if he has gone back in time to be with his love interest in the 1940s? Can snapping with the glove do anything you want or is it limited to just eliminating/un-eliminating 50% of all living beings on Earth? Could I read the comic books or online forums to get these answers? Maybe, but I won’t because the film should have handled these questions itself.</span></p>\n<p><strong>6. IT Chapter Two</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“IT Chapter Two” was one of my most anticipated films of 2019, however it turned out to be a major bust. This sequel takes us back to Derry after 27 years have passed where Pennywise has risen once again to wreak havoc. After an unnecessarily brutal opening to the movie, we see the kids of the Losers Club all grown up, living their separate lives all far apart from each other. Soon, the film seems to turn into a regurgitation of the first movie once everyone is reunited and is working together to take down Pennywise (again). The casting and acting of each character was amazing (probably the best part of the movie overall), but the film itself felt like nothing more than a compilation of flashbacks to the first film, finished off with a very lame and unfulfilling ending.</span></p>\n<p><strong>7. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who grew up reading the iconic “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” books, the film adaptation left little to be desired. This film follows a group of kids who venture into a haunted house and find a book in which the scary stories seemingly write themselves, and soon, everything that’s written in the book happens in real life. Along the way, we see iconic characters like Harold the Scarecrow terrorize the kids until eventually the movie runs out of characters and the movie ends. There were some genuinely scary parts of the movie that made it hard to not look away from the screen, but the CGI, generic dialogue and ineffective jump scares greatly tarnished the quality of the original “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” books and of the film at hand.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>8. The Lion King</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disney, just please for the love of god, stop rebooting everything. Thanks.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-89664\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though summer may be coming to an end, there’s still time to squeeze in one last trip to the movies to see director Gurinder Chadha’s newest project, “Blinded by the Light.” Based on true events, this film follows the story of Javed Khan (Viveik Kalra) who is struggling to accept the cards that life has dealt him. He belongs to a family of Pakistani immigrants that reside in Luton, England in 1987 — not an ideal place to live in during the era of conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. However, upon meeting the only other South Asian student at his school, Javed begins to find understanding of the world around him via borrowed Bruce Springsteen cassette tapes.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes “Blinded by the Light” such a special film is its cultural relevance despite its 1980s setting. Chadha does a magnificent job of maintaining the balance between showcasing the songs of Springsteen and displaying the harsh acts of racism against Javed and other minorities in his town. With the current rise of ignorance and </span><a href=\"https://www.adl.org/the-anti-immigrant-movement-in-the-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hatred directed toward immigrants</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the U.S., it’s very easy to draw parallels between real life and the themes presented in “Blinded by the Light.” I personally thought it was a brilliant decision on Chadha’s part to explicitly show the kind of treatment that Pakistani and other South Asian people had to deal with during this time because it’s a part of history that rarely gets any exposure in mainstream media. So, along with successfully exhibiting the many iconic works of “the Boss,” Chadha managed to display a dark historical moment in an attempt to create a sense of empathy toward those who experience racism within the audience members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, although “Blinded by the Light” can be quite grim in some moments, Javed’s story ignites intense feelings of hope, revelation and love. As an avid fan of music-related movies, I’ve never seen a film so accurately depict what it feels like when you discover your new favorite music artist, and it’s even more rewarding to watch Javed go through this experience on the big screen. The second you see him decide to give Bruce a listen, it’s clear by the look on his face that he has just opened the door to another world; it’s the same look you had on your face when you heard the Beatles for the first time. Even more so, we see Javed do what we all do upon discovering our favorite musicians: talk and dress the same as these artists. After becoming familiar with the soundtrack that encapsulates his whole life, Javed soon starts to cut the sleeves off his flannels, recite Springsteen lyrics to his friends and sport a Canadian tuxedo 24/7.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

For example, when Javed first listens to Bruce, the audience is hearing what he hears (the hit song “Dancing in the Dark”) and also seeing what he hears: “I get up in the evenin’ / And I ain’t got nothin’ to say. I come home in the mornin’ / I go to bed feelin’ the same way. I ain’t nothin’ but tired / Man, I’m just tired and bored with myself.” Now, just seeing those lyrics by themselves would typically have little effect, but we as audience members discover ourselves feeling relieved and happy to see Javed finally relating to something outside of himself, finding himself in the music. It is with this moment that we see Javed break out of his scared, restrictive and self-conscious shell and express how he truly feels inside, which is entirely rewarding after watching painful scenes of him being a complete pushover to everyone in his life. Additionally, this choice to explicitly display lyrics on screen shows the audience the message of Bruce’s work rather than just relying on people to accurately hear what he’s singing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Blinded by the Light” has everything a great movie should have: a creative storyline, exciting soundtrack, impeccable acting, cultural significance and an amazing message to take home. While the Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, isn’t actually featured in the film, his impact on the working class, regardless of race, is shown with immense accuracy, emotion and heart. After seeing the success of biopics like “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Rocketman,” it’s refreshing to see a director focus on a singular musician without going down the cliché road of just relaying the story of their rise to fame. Chadha instead took a more original and daring route to pay tribute to the iconic Bruce Springsteen; she provided a beautiful narrative of how impactful and uplifting music can be to us in our darkest days. “Blinded by the Light” reminds all of us to not let the world get us down, but to keep pushing and fighting for what we want, just as the Boss would. </span></p><div

the Stonewall Inn have just begun, Neil Armstrong has just taken his first steps on the moon, Charles Manson has just led his hippie cult into extreme violence and the popular culture of the ‘60s is on its last legs. However, with his ninth film, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” (in)famous director Quentin Tarantino presents his audience with a beautifully told narrative of an era that deserved a happier ending. A film that mixes fiction with reality, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is a unique and original work that rightfully stands apart from the rest of the reboots and remakes currently flooding movie theaters this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This alternative period piece follows the declining acting career of the once-famous Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who’s accompanied by his ever-present and loyal stuntman, best friend and unofficial chauffeur, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Yet still, Dalton’s hope of remaining relevant in Hollywood is restored when he realizes his next-door neighbors are none other than the famous couple: director Roman Polanski (Rafa</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ł</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Zawierucha) and actress/model Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Along the way, we watch Dalton search for meaning and purpose as an aging actor in Hollywood, and audience members are shown different perspectives of iconic moments in history, each scene delightfully bathed in the golden sunshine of an idealized Los Angeles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the film’s focus on Dalton, Booth and Tate, Tarantino also ties in the chilling story of Charles Manson and his cult of young, long-haired, barefoot hippies known as the Manson Family. Unlike several other filmmakers who have already told this story, Tarantino chose instead to concentrate on the members of the Manson Family more than the ringleader himself. In doing this, Tarantino successfully manages to include this grim moment in history without distracting too much from the narrative at hand. Perhaps if Charles Manson were more present in “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” it would have felt as if the film were relying solely on the awe factor of his crimes rather than focusing on the glorious showcase of ‘60s filmmaking that Tarantino has so beautifully captured in this period piece.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

While this is obvious with the main character of Rick Dalton, I found it even more impactful when applied to the role of Sharon Tate. Known for her acting and modeling career, but even more so for her tragic death, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” offers insight into who Tate was as a person, more than just her profile as a murder victim. It was quite moving to see this kind of representation of Tate, especially towards the end of the film (don’t worry, I won’t give away any spoilers) when all hell breaks loose. Tarantino made an excellent choice in casting Margot Robbie for this role, as she so happily dances, dresses and walks with a sweet style that feels immensely authentic to the real Sharon Tate. However, I wish there had been more screen time for this character as she was an extremely prominent figure during this point in Hollywood history. Overall, Robbie played Tate splendidly, giving life back to the once young, beautiful and ambitious actress that was so tragically murdered in her home at eight and a half months pregnant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the soundtrack to “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is just as beautiful as the film itself. Featuring artists like Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Deep Purple and The Box Tops, as well as less famous covers of big songs like “California Dreamin’” by the Mamas and the Papas, the film is full of fun, audio-driven nostalgia that makes you want to get up and dance with everyone on screen. Some of the most satisfying uses of these songs, however, are employed when Cliff Booth is driving around Los Angeles; somehow Tarantino has managed to completely encapsulate the freedom one feels when driving alone around a beautiful city, listening loudly to their favorite songs. Combined with the outstanding camerawork in this movie, the perfectly-suited soundtrack choices create an enticing and memorable experience that leaves you wanting to go back to the theater for seconds.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89425\" style=\"width: 535px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1305622799\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89422\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89425\" data-attachment-id=\"89425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-28/tarantino-sends-his-love-to-hollywood-in-his-biggest-box-office-opening-yet/once-upon-a-time/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"once upon a time\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89425\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?resize=525%2C350\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89425\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Sony Pictures</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to the rest of Tarantino’s filmography, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” shows a level of maturity and grace not so present in his other flicks that often feature excessive amounts of violence and crude language. That’s not to say that these common threads are bad or that they don’t exist in “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” because they definitely do, but the fashion in which they are filmed and where they are located in the plot signifies a great shift in direction of the typical Tarantino film. The level of suspense created in the lead-up to the final scene of the movie seems to exponentially intensify with each passing, gruesome second. It’s with this final showdown that we in the audience are reminded just how rewarding and fascinating it is to see that Tarantino has once again transformed violence into its own cinematic art form, invoking every emotion on the spectrum from disgust to relief. Of course, it wouldn’t be a true Tarantino film without bloodshed; however, its depiction in this piece feels unexpectedly fresh and provides just enough edge to simultaneously balance out the mellow vibes from the rest of the movie and yet still cause substantial shock to the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing I’ll say about “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is that the amount of foot shots definitely solidified the whole rumor that Quentin Tarantino has a foot fetish. Despite my preference for not being forced to constantly look at dirty, bare feet, I can’t wait for the next and final endeavor Tarantino attempts in his dark, magical world of filmmaking.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

the past with rose-colored glasses. What I mean by that is that we tend to define moments in our lives not by some sort of objective measure of exactly what happened, but by the way we felt while we were doing it. Instead of remembering the exact details of shows like “Ben 10,” “Johnny Test” or “iCarly,” I tend to remember the way they made me feel: safe and happy, with my bowl of Cocoa Puffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on those shows today, I still feel nostalgic about them, but it’s hard for my adult(ish) eyes to appreciate them as deeply as I did then. A lot of these shows are racked with cheesy villains, bleh dialogue and boring, predictable plots </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s hard for me to muster up the same suspension of belief I once so easily could and hop back into a world like that. The nostalgia I feel now just isn’t enough to fill the gap left by this newfound lack of substance, at least for most shows. But there happens to be a very notable exception to this: “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I finished rewatching the whole series after many years, and I found myself experiencing many of the same emotions I felt when I first watched it almost 13 years ago: a deep, breathless fascination with the world of the Four Nations and an authentic emotional connection with each of the thoughtful and multifaceted characters. And now, as a semi-adult, I realize just how brilliantly this so-called “kids show” told a compelling and deeply moving story about war, genocide, conquest, honor and most of all, redemption without taking itself too seriously or relying on blood and gore. I truly think it’s one of the best animated shows ever made and a shining example of what great storytelling looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is set in a world in which the people use martial arts to “bend” the four elements: water, earth, fire and air. (In story writing terms, this is a fairly “hard” magic system, in which the rules and costs of using magic are pretty tightly and explicitly defined. Compare this to a “soft” magic system, like the Lord of the Rings universe, in which magic is a mysterious force used by equally mysterious characters with few explicit rules. More on this </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVrnfniQiS8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each group of benders formed a nation around the art of bending their element. Each nation, in a pretty slick story writing move, is designed with characteristics, a value system and culture that centers around the traits of their element. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Avatar, in this world, serves as a guiding force. He/she is the only person with the ability to master all four elements and is tasked with using this immense power to maintain peace in the world. Yet the Avatar mysteriously disappears, and in his absence, an increasingly militant Fire Nation decides to “share their prosperity” with the rest of the world and sets its sights on total world domination. Without seeing any blood or gore, we are shown the results of the ensuing genocide: the entirety of the Air Nomads have been wiped out, the Water Tribe has been crippled and the Earth Kingdom is under heavy siege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a hundred years since the war began and the Fire Nation is close to victory, until two siblings, Katara and Sokka, discover Aang, who is revealed to be the Avatar. After seeing what the world has become in the Avatar’s absence and what happened to his friends and teachers, Aang vows to learn the other three elements, take on the Fire Nation and restore balance to the world. Katara and Sokka join Aang on his quest and are pursued all around the world by Prince Zuko: a relentless, arrogant and banished prince from the Fire Nation who’s been told that the only way he’s going to be welcomed home is if he captures the Avatar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In building these characters, the show gives a deeply personal account to the consequences of war: the shattering of lives, the depth of the human capacity for evil and the ability of a humble and courageous individual to find hope. I could spend hours talking about all the brilliant characters in this series, but I want to focus on two in particular that created one of the most satisfying redemption stories I’ve ever seen: Prince Zuko and his uncle Iroh.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning of the show, Prince Zuko is exactly what he sounds like: a complete asshole. He’s callous, rude and reckless, often willing to cross any lines necessary (including endangering the lives of his ship’s soldiers) to have his royalty restored. He has a completely backwards sense of right and wrong, and on first glance, he seems… boring. Just a typical cynical bad guy with a bone to pick. But the show provides us with flashbacks and tells us Zuko’s heart-wrenching story.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89291\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2053533590\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89289\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89291\" data-attachment-id=\"89291\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/zuko/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"655,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"zuko\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=655%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Nickelodeon</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are taken back to a war strategy meeting in which Zuko, as the Crown Prince, sits next to his father Fire Lord Ozai. One of the generals suggests a strategy that purposely sacrifices Fire Nation soldiers to gain an edge in a battle. Without waiting for his turn to speak, Zuko angrily protests, asking how they can consider themselves leaders of the Fire Nation when they are willing to throw away civilian lives for next to nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By speaking out, Zuko is accused of being disrespectful not only to the general, but to the person who called the meeting: his own father, Fire Lord Ozai. To teach Zuko “respect,” Ozai challenges him to an Agni Kai, a ritualistic duel between two firebenders to resolve a fight. At the arena, Zuko realizes who he has to battle and breaks down in tears, refusing to fight his own father. His father sees this as an act of weakness and burns Zuko, permanently scarring his face, as well as banishing him from the Fire Nation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is here that we realize that Zuko’s arrogance comes from a deep sense of shame within him: his whole life, he was told by the world that he wasn’t enough. He is disrespectful because no one ever showed him respect or treated him like a human being. He disregards his soldiers’ lives because he was made an outcast for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to care for them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That’s why his sense of right and wrong is so backwards: he lost his family, honor, nation and life for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to be good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always found that the most compelling villains are the ones who you understand. You don’t need to agree with them or endorse their end goal, but if you experience their journey, you can’t help but empathize with them on some level, and both them and the story feel much more real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, Zuko finds his way back to the Fire Nation as Crown Prince, back by his father’s side. He has everything he thought he wanted: a home, a family and a nation, but he feels distressed and unsatisfied. To get here, he betrayed his uncle Iroh, the only real father figure in his life, who had begged him to look inside himself and ask if this was what he really wanted. These feelings of guilt and unhappiness overwhelm Zuko. After learning of the terrible devastation his father plans to wreak on the world, Zuko realized that this identity of a fierce, proud and loyal Fire Nation prince was an identity that was handed to him and not his own. In pursuing his redemption, Zuko never stopped to consider if the future he was fighting for was a good one, or if he </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even really wanted it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Zuko went on his hunt for the Avatar, he journeyed across the Four Nations. He didn’t see a world grateful and awed by the Fire Nation; he saw a world terrified by it. He saw the consequences of his terrible actions and the harm they had caused. Zuko decides that no matter his past, it’s his duty to do whatever he can to end the war. In a jaw-dropping turn, he asks Aang for forgiveness and asks to teach him firebending and help him defeat his father. He finds his uncle, and in one of the most emotional scenes in the show, begs for his forgiveness. Iroh, teary eyed, hugs him, saying, “I was never angry with you. I was just sad because I thought you had lost your way. But you found it again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most beautiful messages in “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is this: making mistakes doesn’t mean you’re an unworthy or bad human being. It just means you’re a human being. Instead of continuing to lie to himself and the rest of the world about who he was, Zuko decided to own his mistakes and use the strengths he had to humbly guide the world in a better direction. He wasn’t a hero in spite of his mistakes; he was a hero </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because of</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his mistakes, and what he learned from them. In doing so, he became greater than any of us could have ever imagined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its beautiful animation style to its inspiring story, this show presents to us the brutal consequences of war and ideology, the capacity of humans to do great good as well as great evil and the importance of mistakes and humility. This could have been a much, much longer review, but suffice it to say that “Avatar: The Last Airbender” has a message many of us could really use right now. It asks us to make a genuine effort to understand each other’s stories and not hate others (and perhaps more crucially, ourselves) because of mistakes that are made. Yes, there are awful people in the world, but refusing to let contempt cloud our emotions can be the difference between a broken and a healing society. Overall, I love this show with all my heart, and I’m a better person because of the lessons it taught me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10/10 – Masterpiece</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/","id":6224,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6223,6222,6221],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Year of the Musical Biopic","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2019-07-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nexusgraphic.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nexusgraphic.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"These blink-and-you-miss-them genres will always be a part of film.

Before that, it was the gangster and mob craze kicked off by “The Godfather.” And before that, audiences of the ‘40s were enticed by big-budget romantic epics like “Gone with the Wind” that have since gone out of style with modern audiences. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blink-and-you-miss-them genres will always be a part of film. Right now, we’re in the era of the musical biopic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bohemian Rhapsody” swept through the 2018 awards season, earning a total of four Oscars for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. This summer, in the span of just a few weeks, “Rocketman,” following Elton John’s life, and “Yesterday,” an original story centered around the music of the Beatles, were released in theaters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But unlike some of the other short-lived movie moments of past eras, the musical biopic won’t hold up in history. At its best, it’s a flashy but fun story that relies on audience appeal. At its worst, it’s cheap filmmaking using songs as a crutch, fitting the lives of some of the most famous modern musicians into a simple three-act structure: the meteoric rise of the star, their eventual fall and the resolution that they have emotionally bettered themselves and risen to power once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On first view, I loved the musical biopics of this past year. I remember walking out of the theater after each of these films with a huge smile on my face, exhilarated by the music and production. But the rush when I first left the theater didn’t last. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For obvious reasons, only the highlights of these musicians’ long and winding careers are capitalized in their films. “Bohemian Rhapsody”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes brief reference to Freddie Mercury’s less successful solo work, but for the most part, these films act like a cinematic translation of a greatest hits CD. In reality, there is complexity not only of the artists but of their actual music. The biopic genre reflects the trials and tribulations of the artists, but their work is always impeccable; filmmakers have no need to include backtracks and unpopular endeavors that a mainstream audience wouldn’t recognize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Musical biopics often fail because instead of using music to make a more innovative story, they let the use of popular music hold them back. Am I watching a two hour jukebox karaoke stream, or is the film really using music to tell its story? The answer is far more the former than the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least “Yesterday”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take minimal risks, with “Yesterday” telling an original story through Beatles discography and “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through bold risks in narrative structures. “Bohemian Rhapsody”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not, yet it has come away with numerous awards and accolades. Don’t ask me how. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89296\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"807287304\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89288\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89296\" data-attachment-id=\"89296\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/the-year-of-the-musical-biopic/bohemian-rhapsody/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bohemian rhapsody\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89296\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of 20th Century Fox.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bohemian Rhapsody,” of the “big three” musical films of the past year, fell the hardest into the trap of cheap storytelling.

Most musical biopics attempt a pitch perfect recreation of songs, often using recordings from the original artists and every sound mixing technique. The goal is for the difference to be unrecognizable. “Rocketman” took liberties with speed and sound of the songs to fit what the John’s character was feeling in a particular scene. The songs are more thematic than chronological of his career. “The Bitch is Back,” one of John’s later pieces, is sung early in the film during John’s childhood. Conversely, “I’m Still Standing” was recorded before John went to rehab in 1990, yet the film uses the piece for John’s triumphant recovery.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These little nuances in song choice are a way the music is used to elevate the story instead of simply marking a scene. But overall, “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">simplifies the larger than life narrative of Elton John. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What many in Hollywood fail to see is the multitude of ways to pay homage to musical artists besides the biopic. “Yesterday,” currently playing in theaters, is turning a new tide in the current musical biopic renaissance. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89298\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1781412502\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89288\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89298\" data-attachment-id=\"89298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/the-year-of-the-musical-biopic/yesterday/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,550\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"yesterday\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=888%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89298\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=888%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Universal Pictures.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yesterday”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tells a deeper and richer story that ultimately pays more respect to the Beatles by staying further from the Fab Four themselves and focusing on the music more than anything. Jack Malik awakens after an accident and realizes that he is the only person on Earth who remembers the Beatles, recreating their songs to become famous himself. The film is able to explore deeper themes of music preservation and the negative sides to the music industry through Jack’s rise to fame, rather than retelling the familiar story of how John, George, Paul and Ringo were all torn apart by it. The story behind many Beatles songs are so familiar that there’s no originality to explaining why John Lennon wrote “Help!” for example, but watching Jack’s cry for help near the end of the movie through that song in particular provides a fresh perspective to the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yesterday,” in many places, still feels like a musical biopic because of how close Jack’s rise to power was to the Beatles. But by telling an original story in a universe without the Beatles, the film can show us exactly what the band had to sacrifice for their fame. Near the end of the film, as Jack is in the middle of a crisis about taking credit for the Beatles’ music, he gets to meet John Lennon, who without the Beatles is living peacefully in the countryside and has lived a long life of success – not through fame, but of happiness and love. This scene shows us from a different perspective just how much the Beatles, and Jack Malik, sacrificed for their stardom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original storyline of “Yesterday” got right what so many musical biopics get wrong, but in no way is it a perfect film. It still limits itself to the same old formula of the three-act rise, fall and rise again of the star. It just so happens that star is a new character instead of the original artist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it that other film genres become more daring and innovative year by year, while the musical biopic seems to be frozen in time? Perhaps maybe I am too harsh to expect more from the musical biopic than what they give time and time again. The summer blockbuster, for better and worse, is mainly a market for mainstream fun flicks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Freddie Mercury, Elton John and the Beatles shared was widespread popularity through constantly innovating and breaking new ground. What these films share today is the tendency to play it safe.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

constantly harassed me about it since high school, but I never had any interest until finally my mom and I binge-watched it through the summer. I was obsessed; the show had everything you could want —  dragons, zombies, romance, action and drama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final season makes me wish I had stuck to my anti-”Game of Thrones” convictions. While previous seasons have spent episodes on character and plot development, this season has cast aside previous writing themes in order to hastily close out the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most egregious example of this is Season 8, Episode 3:“The Long Night.” Despite the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/arts/television/game-of-thrones-battle-of-winterfell-review.html\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> praising it as “a masterpiece” that “exceeded expectations,” I and everyone I have talked to about it were left sorely disappointed. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phrase “winter is coming” became iconic within the show; it was used in “Thrones” advertising and suggested that time was running out before the ultimate showdown between the living and the dead. We spent the entirety of the show waiting for this moment, and it painfully missed the mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first episode of the third season, Jon Snow announces that he would rather fight on the side of the living when he joins the ranks of the wildlings in trying to recruit them to venture south of the Wall to fight against the White Walkers. After that moment, Jon spends the rest of the show trying to get others to understand that the game of thrones is trivial to the real threat, the White Walkers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writers D. B. Weiss and David Benioff threw all of that in the garbage with “The Long Night,” as the battle spanned only one episode and was over before dawn. Beyond having to hold my computer screen six inches from my face to see anything with the horrible lighting, the lack of a real fight between dragons, significant character deaths and poor battle tactics made this a terribly disappointing episode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to say there weren’t good moments; the scene of Dothraki fires going out while the rest of the army waited in silence was chilling, but the writers cannot rely on battle footage and cinematography alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this season, it feels like the writers were trying to emulate the shock value of the Red Wedding, which has been widely praised for its gruesome twist, while ignoring the extensive development and foreshadowing that contributed to the success of the episode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a brief recap, Robb Stark first starts bonding with Talisa Maegyr in Season 2, Episode 6, and he is warned by Catelyn Stark not to forget his commitment to the Freys. He is then warned again in Season 3, Episode 5 not to alienate the Karstarks, which he ignores, losing half of his army and forcing him to go to the Freys for assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Red Wedding was the culmination of 13 episodes of Robb’s poor decision-making, resulting in his and Catelyn’s death. In contrast, Daenerys Targaryen had a maximum of one episode to show her increasing lust for power and fear of Jon taking over before she decides to burn King’s Landing to the ground. This is especially shocking considering her seasons-long crusade against slavery and her horror in Season 4, Episode 4 when Drogon kills a young child, leading her to chain away her dragons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we get a taste of her bloodthirst in Season 7, Episode 7 when she burns the Tarlys for refusing to bend the knee, this is still not enough development to justify her burning the innocent peasants of King’s Landing alive despite their surrender. This is no longer tactical, but rather personal. It’s a twist for the sake of a twist, with no backing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quality of characters and dialogue has also dramatically declined. Within the game of thrones, themes of explicit and implicit power are often discussed, with Cersei Lannister valuing fear and physical force, and Varys and Littlefinger choosing to play with information in the shadows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first episode of Season 2, Varys tells Tyrion Lannister, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Power resides where men believe it resides. It’s a trick. A shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He is eloquent, poised and always seems one step ahead of the rest of the characters. In Season 8, however, this eloquence is absent, with gems like “cocks are important, I’m afraid.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many other characters have been similarly butchered, with Jaime Lannister saying he doesn’t care about innocents, despite killing the Mad King to protect innocent people. Also, Bran Stark’s character has access to all of human history and can warg into other people or animals, but instead he spends his time talking about wheelchair design, while Cersei, one of the most power-hungry and notorious villains within the show has had almost zero lines, spending most of her screen time sipping wine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this would be somewhat forgivable if there wasn’t only one episode left. In an </span><a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/09/game-of-thrones-season-8-showrunners-interview/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entertainment Weekly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, writers D. B. Weiss and David Benioff said that HBO would have been happy to fund more episodes, but the writers decided that was unnecessary. This has led some fans to speculate that the writers wanted to start working on the next Star Wars “Star Wars” movie, which will be released in 2022. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the opportunity for more episodes, the rushed storylines and abrupt ending becomes unforgivable. Heading into the show finale this weekend, we are waiting on a resolution for beloved characters like Tyrion, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark and Drogon to name a few, as well as the power struggle between Jon and Daenerys. The writers also need to give some conclusion regarding the future of the Seven Kingdoms with King’s Landing razed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a lot for one episode, and I’m skeptical that the writers can pull off a good ending to a disastrous season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E1 – Dany heads across red waste</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E4 – Dany finally reaches Qarth</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E5 –  Bran dreams of “the sea”, aka ironborn, coming to Winterfell. Theon then arrives to take it over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E6 – Bran and Rickon smuggled out of winterfell. Also, Robb starts falling for Talisa, Catelyn warns Robb that he promised to marry a Frey daughter. Also, Dany’s dragons are stolen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E8 – Robb and Talisa sleep together for the first time. Dany’s dragons still stolen</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrion Lannister to Cersei Lannister: “I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you’re safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you’ll know the debt is paid.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E9 – Battle of Blackwater, wildfire introduced with 1 unmanned ship spewing it, taking out tons of ships, Stannis v. Tywin, shows Tywin’s ruthlessness and brains. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Stannis’ forces gaining ground and the Lannister men losing confidence, Tyrion rallies the troops and leads a successful counterattack on the Baratheon forces battering the Mud Gate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S2, E10 – Bran and others start to head north. Robb decides not to marry Frey daughter, weds Talisa. Dany in the House of the Undying. White walkers and army of Wights are coming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E1- Dany reaches Astapor in Slavers bay, tries to buy unsillied. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E2 – Rickard Karstark. Rickard bashes Robb for forsaking any possible marriage alliances by marrying Talisa. Jojen appears to Bran in a prophetic dream and tells Bran that he is the three-eyed raven.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E4 – When the battle is over, Daenerys gives the Unsullied the choice of leaving or staying to fight for her as free men. Each and every soldier stays and the army marches triumphantly away from Astapor. “A dragon is not a slave” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E5 – At Riverrun, Rickard Karstark decides to exact his revenge on Jaime by killing his kin, the captive Willem and Martyn Lannister. Robb is livid when he finds out that Rickard has murdered the two defenseless young boys and, despite Catelyn, Talisa and Edmure’s warnings that the Karstarks will abandon his cause if he executes Rickard, Robb does just that. Later, when nearly half of Robb’s army has left Riverrun, Robb and Talisa discuss how to move forward. They ultimately come to the conclusion that Robb will have to make nice with the Freys in order to recruit enough soldiers to have a chance at sacking the Lannister stronghold of Casterly rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E6 – At Riverrun, Robb meets with Walder Frey’s sons, Black Walder Rivers (Tim Plester) and Lothar Frey (Tom Brooke), to discuss a possible alliance. Robb agrees to formally apologize to Walder Frey, gift Harrenhal to him and marry Edmure off to his daughter Roslin (Alexandra Dowling).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E7 – Dany is saying she will destroy Yunkai if all the slaves aren’t released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the road to the Twins, Robb’s army is delayed by a rainstorm, a setback that Catelyn insists Walder Frey will see as a personal slight. That night, Talisa tells Robb she is pregnant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S3, E9 “The Rains of Castamere”- Dany sacks Yunkai. Bran wargs into Direwolf to help Jon. After arriving at the Twins, Robb fulfills his promise to publicly apologize to Walder Frey, but not without Walder getting in some lecherous jabs about Talisa. However, when all is said and done, Walder welcomes the Starks into his home as his guests. At the altar, Edmure is pleasantly surprised to discover that his bride-to-be, Roslin, is much more stereotypically attractive than the rest of the Freys and the wedding ceremony goes off without a hitch. Robb, Talisa, and Catelyn die.  Took more than a full season for this to play out, with Robb being warned multiple times. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Although Santa Barbara is loaded with tons of beautiful natural scenery to admire, Gauchos will soon be celebrating a different, special kind of grass on Saturday, April 20. To commemorate this stoner holiday, here’s a list of movies about weed and its related adventures, perfect for a night spent with the munchies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. “Half Baked” (1998)</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Written by and starring comedian Dave Chappelle, this may perhaps be one of the best stoner movies ever made. “Half Baked” follows Chappelle’s character as he and his stoner gang begin to sell stolen pharmaceutical marijuana in an effort to bail out the fourth member of their crew (who’s in jail for a weed-related crime, obviously). Along the way, Chappelle extends the metaphor of his love for marijuana by becoming romantically involved with his character’s love interest, appropriately named Mary Jane.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pineapple Express” (2008)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known as the movie that inspired its own strain, “Pineapple Express’’ is a stoner essential. Watch as Seth Rogen’s blazed-out character and his drug dealer friend played by James Franco find themselves in the middle of a drug war after accidentally witnessing a murder. Laced with cross joints, crooked cops and lots of gun scenes, this movie also highlights the importance of friendship as the pair struggle not to get caught by a dangerous drug lord.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Up in Smoke” (1978)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was difficult deciding which Cheech and Chong film to include on this list since there are so many to choose from, but I figured it’d be best to start from the very beginning of their stoner legacy. “Up in Smoke” captures the beginning of a new friendship between two unlikely pot smokers as they bond over their love for marijuana. Upon getting to know each other through conversation and smoking, they soon get arrested for possession. Once released on a technicality, the two carry on with their stoner hijinks and even form a rock band to enter a musical competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. “Dazed and Confused” (1993)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set in Austin, Texas, “Dazed and Confused” documents the antics of local teenagers in 1976 as they celebrate the last day of school and the beginning of summer break. The freshmen try to avoid being hazed, the seniors organize a last-minute keg party and Matthew McConaughey delivers the infamous “Alright, alright, alright” line </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all to an outrageously groovy ’70s classic rock soundtrack. So, what do you say? Are you cool, man?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. “Super Troopers” (2001)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Written by and starring the members of comedy troupe Broken Lizard, “Super Troopers” follows five state troopers in Vermont who spend their time smoking pot and messing around with random motorists. Eventually, the troopers discover unusual action happening along the northern border, which turns out to be linked to marijuana drug dealing. While watching a movie about “cops” seems like a turn-off to stoners, it’s hilarious to see these bumbling troopers perform as such an exaggerated, dumb group of police in this pot-lover’s cult classic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. “How High” (2001)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting their hands on some supernatural kush, two young stoners manage to ace their college entrance exams and get full rides to Harvard University. They quickly discover they are nothing like the smart, stressed out Ivy League students around them, so they continue smoking their magical marijuana to maintain good grades in school until it of course runs out. Although they eventually learn they’re good enough on their own to academically succeed, “How High” displays the use of weed in a collegiate environment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relatable to our own here in Isla Vista </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a hilarious stoner flick for all to enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” (2001)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known specifically for their nerdy and stoner-revolved comedy, director and actor Kevin Smith delivers on just that with the film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” The title itself refers to “Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back,” which stands as a prelude for the many superhero- and comic book themed-jokes throughout the movie. After learning of a movie being made on the comic book series </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bluntman and Chronic</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that includes characters based entirely on Jay and Silent Bob, they decide to trek all the way to Hollywood to sabotage the film’s production once they discover they will be receiving no royalties from their likenesses being used.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. “Friday” (1995)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Written by and starring the rapper Ice Cube, “Friday” shows a day in the life of Craig who gets fired from his job on his day off and spends the day with his best (stoner) friend, appropriately named Smokey. After Craig accidentally gets involved in Smokey’s pot-dealing debts, the two find themselves trying to make $200 worth of marijuana money back by the end of the day or else they’ll be in a world of trouble. Although weed is technically the reason for the film’s main conflict, it still provides lots of great comedic moments throughout the movie.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87599\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/eight-blazin-4-20-movies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87599\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/eight-blazin-4-20-movies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/eight-blazin-4-20-movies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/eight-blazin-4-20-movies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/eight-blazin-4-20-movies/","id":6239,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6238,6237,6236],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Michael B.

Here is a recap of each day of the star-studded, multi-day celebration:</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 1: Jan. 30</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) opened and closed with Santa Barbara films, starting with a screening of the film “Diving Deep: The Life and Times of Mike deGruy.” The film was directed by Mimi DeGruy, the wife of the story’s protagonist Mike deGruy. Mimi commended Roger Durling, the executive director of the film festival, for keeping the festival local in regards to putting a spotlight on Santa Barbara films, even though the event is traditionally global in scope.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is a documentary about Mike deGruy, a biologist and filmmaker who filmed in oceans around the world, capturing images of unique sea creatures. DeGruy died in a helicopter crash in Australia in 2012 while filming for James Cameron. The film serves as a memoriam that celebrates deGruy’s achievements and passions through Mimi’s point of view.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 2: Jan. 31</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second day opened at the Arlington Theatre with one of the most anticipated tribute events of the festival, the Outstanding Directors of the Year award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The honorees included Alfonso Cuarón of “Roma,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yorgos Lanthimos of “The Favourite</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spike Lee of “BlacKkKlansman</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam McKay of “Vice”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pawel Pawlikowski of “Cold War.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each director participated in a one-on-one interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hollywood Reporter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> columnist Scott Feinberg. All praised each other’s films profusely and when asked to identify other noteworthy films of the year, three of the five directors selected films directed by women. A notable response from Cuarón about his filmmaking process was that he “had to have less control in the process in order to give him more creative freedom.” Roger Durling closed by presenting the five directors with their awards, noting the cinematic talent and diversity in the group.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 3: Feb. 1</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day three was one of the most anticipated tribute nights of the whole festival, with Rami Malek receiving the Outstanding Performer of the Year award for his performance as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the chance to speak with Malek, who arrived at the red carpet with presenter and co-star Joe Mazzello and co-star Lucy Boynton:</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you have any background on Queen before acting in “Bohemian Rhapsody”?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not like I do now, no. I think everyone in this cast feels like they could write their own biography about the band. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, it was just hearing the music and feeling the same passion behind it that we all feel when we hear a Queen song. I think it touches everyone in their own unique ways, but it galvanizes us. It’s a story that I wanted to be a part of telling.</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a certain amount of pressure with playing such a legend in a biographical film. Did you feel any of this pressure while acting?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, an immense amount of pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just thought that if I had the right resources and enough time, that there would be a chance that I could pull it off. I think when we get to be the face of these films — the image that people see — but for myself, it’s a combination of so many different forces that have allowed me to stand here and say, ‘I got to portray Freddie Mercury and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possibly </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pull it off,’ and that is due to the work of everyone on set. It’s everyone coming together and creating that performance that allows me to represent a film and not just myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malek was then interviewed by Feinberg about his career and background; Malek spoke about how his early gigs placed him into a category of “Egyptian roles” because of his ethnicity and about his initial struggle to make his mark in the industry. Malek also talked about his preparation for his role as Freddie Mercury, in which he detailed his admiration towards Queen and Freddie’s passion and comfort on the stage.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 4: Feb. 2</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viggo Mortensen was honored with the American Riviera Award for his performance in “Green Book</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen was interviewed by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deadline</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> awards columnist Pete Hammond, reflecting upon his acting career. Mortensen said he decided to become an actor at the “relatively late age” of 21 but started educating himself on film by visiting revival movie houses, where he became inspired by “spellbinding performances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated that he was lucky to land so many minor roles early in his career because it allowed him to practice the craft of acting. He cites the “Lord of the Rings” franchise as opening the door for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen closed by remarking that the best result of “Green Book”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that it has helped people discover the music of classical and jazz pianist and composer Don Shirley. At the end of the night, Mortensen’s longtime friend Ed Harris presented the actor with the award. </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 5: Feb. 3</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glenn Close was first presented with the Maltin Modern Master Award for her performance in “The Wife.” Close discussed “The Wife” in an interview with film critic Leonard Maltin. Close stated that it took 14 years to get the money to make the film, but that it had an interesting script unlike any other project she’d done before. She also went on to discuss her performance in other films like “Fatal Attraction” and “Cruella de Vil.” Close was humbled when she accepted the award, saying she is “blessed to be able to do the thing I love most in the world.” Close’s dog, Pip, also made numerous appearances onstage during the tribute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that evening, a sold-out crowd attended the Montecito Award tribute, given to Melissa McCarthy for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” In a conversation with IndieWire Editor Anne Thompson, McCarthy discussed her early work in “Gilmore Girls,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reminiscing upon her first job which lasted for seven years. She went on to discuss “Bridesmaids,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Hangover” and her love for producing with “building a project from the beginning up.” McCarthy’s co-star Richard E. Grant presented her with the award and McCarthy thanked the SBIFF for “shining a light on these types of movies.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 6: Feb. 4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On day six, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variety</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presented the Variety Artisans Awards at the Lobero Theatre to those “essential to the filmmaking process who have exhibited the most innovative work of the year in their respective fields.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The award was presented to 12 Oscar nominees, including “Black Panther” costume designer Ruth Carter and “Mary Poppins” composer Marc Shaiman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of honorees is below:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barry Alexander Brown (“BlakKklansman”), Ruth E. Carter (“Black Panther”), Fiona Crombie (“The Favourite”), Lukasz Zal (“Cold War”)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patricia Dehaney (“Vice”), David Shirk (“Ready Player One”), Marc Shaiman (“Mary Poppins Returns”)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skip Lievsay, Craig Henighan and José Antonio García (“Roma”) and Sergio Diaz and Skip Lievsay (“Roma”). </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 7: Feb. 5</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day seven entailed The Virtuosos Awards, intended to honor actors for noteworthy performances. Each honoree engaged in a one-on-one discussion with interviewer Dave Karger, followed by participation in a panel discussion. Each actor discussed their acting experience and how they learned to channel emotions and realize the scope of their role to truly succeed in their respective films. Following the panel discussion, actor Christopher Lloyd presented the awards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The honorees included:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yalitza Aparicio (“Roma”), Sam Elliott (“A Star is Born”), Elsie Fisher (“Eighth Grade”), Claire Foy (“First Man”), Richard E. Grant (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”), Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie (“Leave No Trace”), John David Washington (“BlacKkKlansman”) and Steven Yeun (“Burning”). </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 8: Feb. 7</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day eight was by far the most media-heavy and fan-filled night with the last tribute award: the Cinema Vanguard Award honoring Michael B. Jordan for his work in “Black Panther”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Creed II.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan was greeted by a mob of excited fans, followed by a brief red carpet appearance before his interview with Feinberg. Jordan discussed working on a soap opera, his big move to Los Angeles, his preference towards non-stereotypical roles and ended on the significance of “Black Panther”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as a cultural phenomenon that he called their “Star Wars</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actor Jamie Foxx made a surprise appearance to present Jordan with the award. “I’m not in this for fame.

400;\">Although The Beatles may be regarded as gems of the past, UCSB’s own Pollock Theater has recently opened up its stage for the talents of John, Paul, George and Ringo to shine once more. In this new “Beatles Revolutions” film series curated by the Carsey-Wolf Center, “A Hard Day’s Night” kicked things off last Thursday with a free screening for students and community members, followed by a Q&amp;A session with journalist Ivor Davis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for their “Script to Screen” series, this year the Carsey-Wolf Center introduces “Beatles Revolutions.” This winter film series is dedicated to showcasing the lives of those four iconic Liverpool musicians who changed music forever. Examining the various ways The Beatles inspired revolutions not only in music but also in politics and culture, the series includes several different film styles revolving around these topics. With free screenings of the documentaries, animation films, live performances and adaptation films, Pollock is now offering music fans and film buffs alike a wide scope of the true effect The Beatles had on the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Pollock showed “A Hard Day’s Night,” and Beatles fans of all ages made an appearance to the sold-out screening. While I had been to the Pollock several times prior to this, I had never actually gone to an event there that sold out every ticket. And, after viewing this film, it’s easy to understand why it did. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the film came out in 1964 at the beginning of The Beatles’ vast career, it accurately captures the wave of Beatlemania that was to come. Director Richard Lester uses an interesting filming style that works to both document the group’s antics as well as follow a very loose yet fun plotline. Lester’s style is described by the Carsey-Wolf Center as a “black-and white, semi-documentary style with a cartoonish energy that celebrates the Beatles at work and at play.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A Hard Day’s Night” differs from a lot of movies I’ve seen, as it sticks to no formal film rules and often dances on the fringe of a fictitious and realistic plot. The whole film is centered around the band traveling to appear on television for a live performance, only to face several obstacles along the way and sing their own songs while they’re at it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As The Beatles are musicians before actors, the decision to use the film and band’s popularity to further showcase their music was quite an obvious one. While normally musical scenes in movies can be used to push a story forward or serve as a transition, “A Hard Day’s Night” uses the tracks of the album that have the same name as the film primarily to imbue them with some sort of exposure. Cynically, one can view this film as merely a giant advertisement for the band’s latest album release at the time; however, The Beatles fan in me refuses to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filled with witty jokes, thick British accents and classic Beatles tunes like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “And I Love Her” and, of course, “A Hard Day’s Night,” this film gave its Pollock Theater audience a show to remember. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this screening of “A Hard Day’s Night,” Pollock Theater will be showing several other Beatles-related flicks throughout the course of the 2019 Winter Quarter. Next up is the 1970 film “Let It Be,” which is also known as the last original release from The Beatles and will be playing Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. This film documents the group’s process of recording the songs for their final album and includes footage of their last live public performance on the rooftop of Apple Corps in London. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more Beatlemania, visit the Pollock on Feb. 12 for “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” Feb. 27 for “Across the Universe” and, finally, March 2 for “Yellow Submarine.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Multi-hyphenate screenwriter, director and producer Adam McKay strives to answer this question with his most recent film, “Vice.” Returning to the screen as another husband and wife dynamic duo, Christian Bale and Amy Adams star as Dick and Lynne Cheney, examining Dick Cheney’s rise to prominence, beginning with his days as a White House intern all the way through his term as vice president of the United States and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Vice” is a far cry from any other biopic of the time period, and, quite frankly, should not be compared to other dramatizations of political events or careers. As people lean into the habit of glorifying the Bush Administration, McKay seeks to drag his audience back to reality — reminding them of the atrocities committed during the years that Bush and Cheney occupied the executive branch. He bluntly reminds us of this through shocking scenes depicting the bombing of Iraqi civilians and the use of torture at American-run detainee camps like Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Unlike contemporaries such as “Darkest Hour”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or “The King’s Speech,” the story of Cheney’s insidious rise to power is riddled with humor that hangs over the audience like a stormcloud, time jumps and one rather peculiar Shakespearean scene. Also unlike the stories of glorious kings, presidents and prime ministers, Bale’s Cheney stars as the antihero of the film, which becomes more and more obvious with his ever-increasing preponderance of power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most difficult tasks of the entire film is the humanization of Vice President Cheney. In depicting a man notorious for his cunning abuse of executive power, willingness to commit horrific crimes against humanity in the name of targeting “enemy combatants” and a snakelike ability to turn on family and friends for the sake of political gain, McKay and Bale certainly had their work cut out for them. While it is quite apparent that the film pins the devastating Iraq War and rise of terrorist organizations like ISIS on Cheney, it also attempts to intersperse moments throughout the plot that serve as a reminder that even the most cold-hearted and ruthless powermongerers have feelings too. A particular soft spot of Cheney’s examined in “Vice” is his relationship with his daughter Mary, his support of her sexuality and his concern for her privacy during his campaign for vice president. However, McKay never lets the audience stray far from the reminder of Cheney’s green light on numerous war crimes. McKay masters the juxtaposition of Cheney’s life as a family man versus that as a ruthless global instigator. In one particular scene, the Cheney family is seen eating a meal on an idyllic porch, surrounded by laughter and innocuous conversation; suddenly, we are transported to Iraq in which we are faced with deafening blasts, burning bodies and the screams of soldiers and civilians alike. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a movie that can sometimes get lost in its storytelling, what really sets “Vice” apart is its remarkable cast. It is no surprise that Bale and Adams keep getting cast as a pair, and this film is no exception; the two deliver a subtle yet still electrifying chemistry and balance each other’s energy to deliver a pair of powerful yet nuanced performances. Additionally, true standout performances are delivered by Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld  and Tyler Perry as Secretary of State Colin Powell. Rockwell disappears into the role of the younger President Bush, and his village idiot-like naïveté expertly furthers the plot of Cheney’s merciless ascent to power. Carell’s Rumsfeld seems to be a step outside of the actor’s wheelhouse, though at times he provided comic relief as the old-school and crude Secretary of Defense. Perry artfully portrays the far-too-smart Powell, reaching his peak in a scene in which, at the behest of Cheney, he regretfully delivers a speech to the UN encouraging the disarmament of Iraq. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phenomenal makeup, transformative cast and at times bizarre employment of storytelling tropes have made “Vice” one of the most unique films of the year. Sobering footage of the Cheney-initiated Iraq war and the involvement of the film’s mysterious and seemingly unrelated narrator had me engaged throughout the duration of the film. I am already looking forward to McKay’s future take on the Trump administration. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

But as I left the theater a few days ago, I realized </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonah Hill’s directorial debut shone as an original skate film all on its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film follows the life of Stevie (Sunny Suljic), a young boy who is struggling to belong in a world of abuse and neglect. One day, while biking around his hometown of Los Angeles, Stevie spots his destiny: the coolest boys he’s ever seen, skateboarding on the sidewalk. This group, comprised of Ray (Na-Kel Smith), Fuckshit (Olan Prenatt), Fourth Grade (Ryder McLaughlin) and Ruben (Gio Galicia) introduce a place for brotherhood and acceptance to Stevie, allowing him to blossom into a confident young man.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The component that really drove this film forward was Hill’s ability to cast a bonafide group of gritty teenagers rather than career actors who had never picked up a skateboard before. At only 13 years old, Sunny Suljic completely embodies the disposition of his character: innocent and promising. Ray, the leader of the group, is played by real-life professional skateboarder Na-Kel Smith, who often shows off his skills throughout the movie. By casting genuine boys like these, Hill was able to create a skate movie without any of the generic tricks and references that frequently plague the genre.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Stevie was the main character of “Mid90s,” Fuckshit, played by Olan Prenatt, stood apart from the others as the confident and witty jokester who provided comedic relief during the movie’s tense moments. Fuckshit’s presence in the film wasn’t a dominant one, yet he still managed to steal the spotlight anytime he was on screen. His performance was remarkable; the delivery of his lines was so natural it was almost hard to believe this was his first time acting. During a Q&amp;A with the cast, Jonah Hill even described Prenatt as “one of the most explosively, funny, and charismatic people, so much so, that I forgot to even officially audition him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the impressive acting in this film, Hill has also successfully managed to capture the ’90s aesthetic through his vintage style of filming. Unlike many modern movies, “Mid90s” is shot on film, not digitally, and is shown in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio. This subtle stylistic choice was the final push that separated “Mid90s” from anything else currently out in theaters, offering the viewer a unique watching experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soundtrack was also wildly thoughtful. Though Hill chose to use popular ’90s artists like A Tribe Called Quest, Nirvana and Morrissey, he did this tastefully by including their lesser known songs rather than their big hits. In turn, this not only displayed Hill’s appreciation for ’90s music but also worked to make this nostalgic period piece feel more legitimate. Here’s a surprising fact: Because of the low budget on this film, Hill had to personally reach out to every music artist featured in the motion picture soundtrack to gain the rights to play their songs in his movie. “We didn’t have any money and the soundtrack is crazy,” he explained. “I had to write letters to all of my favorite artists … every song that’s in the film, I wrote the scene to have that song in it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I will say “Mid90s” is far from being perfect. I won’t give away any spoilers, but there are some very questionable scenes that, while I had expected to see them, almost felt too dark, too lengthy and too inappropriate in comparison to the spirit of the rest of the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ending felt rather rushed and abrupt. Usually, movie endings offer some kind of resolution, and “Mid90s” was lacking just that. At only an hour and 24 minutes long, Hill could have added more to the plot in order to make the story overall feel more complete. But, since this is his first endeavor as both a writer and director, it’s hard to find too much fault in these shortcomings, especially when there are so many beautiful moments to focus on in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonah Hill has plenty of room for improvement in his future projects, but this introduction of his into the world of writing and directing was especially commendable. Rather than showing us obnoxious skating and fashion trends for the sake of a retro aesthetic, Hill instead gave us a believable, relatable story with an extremely charismatic, lovable cast. I never would have thought the “Superbad” star would become this dedicated to the art of film, but I’m glad he did.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The two that stood out most, and that were constantly played, were “A Nightmare On Elm Street” and “Halloween.” Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers are two of the most timeless classic horror villains, and both have had iconic original films that impacted audiences around the world and left imprints in the nightmares of both children and adults. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common element among these films is that they both seem to have taken on exhaustingly long quests by creating an abundance of sequels which, oftentimes, did not land as well as the original. Now another trend has risen where films premier during the Halloween season hoping to become blockbusters. While the numbers in attendance may be flattering, most fail to become cult classics. I write this critique in a tentative manner after watching the latest installment of the “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series, which, although not perfect, was undoubtedly a fun, nostalgia-filled, slasher film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.” Nevertheless, hearing that wretched opening music, combined with the word “Halloween” in dripping, bright orange letters brought out a childlike reaction that had me wanting more. The “Halloween” series built itself by delivering murder scenes fueled with cynicism and other elements that are the quintessence of horror filmmaking. On the surface, Michael Myers can be seen as the average person, a slow-paced walking man wearing a mask. But it’s these details, combined with the idea that he is basically immortal (based on the many times he’s either shot in the face or burned alive), that make Myers, or the notion of him, an uncomfortable, deep-seated fear in the hearts of many. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” sticks to its guns and hovers through some of the original filmmaking tactics and classic murder sequences honed throughout the series. It’s the deadly nighttime appearances by Michael Myers and the lack of a purpose behind his rampant killing spree as he sticks his legendary chef’s knife through a random woman’s throat that keeps the audience jumping in their seats. What pushed horror films like “Halloween” out of the mainstream was the use of enhanced technology and horrific costume designs combined with the too many jump scares. This new “Halloween” undoubtedly shows director David Gordon Green’s appreciation for old-school cinematography and screenwriting. The fact that Green has chosen to stray from integrating more modern takes on horror into this new “Halloween” film is indeed ambitious, but it can also create quite a few setbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dialogue in some of the scenes of this movie are incredibly cringeworthy. Awkward pauses and panel switches feel somewhat outdated, which can be a result of Green’s choice to keep the film’s aesthetic much like the original’s. While watching “Halloween,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could not help but dwell on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliché</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plot holes about a lame high school dance and teenage romance, which are made out to be at the forefront of the film. This is all too common in slasher films — we get a variety of disposable characters and multiple plotlines that cut into the runtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best parts about this rendition, if not</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best, is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and her portrayal of  Laurie Strode. Oct. 26 marks the 40-year anniversary since the initial release of the original “Halloween” film, and she has not aged a bit. We are brought into Strode’s present life after being haunted by the traumatic experiences from her past with Myers, and she is rightfully transformed into a deadly assassin looking for vengeance. While it seems like her granddaughter (Andi Matichak) is supposed to be at the forefront of the film, Curtis steals the show. Her presence could have been utilized much more, considering most people who watched the film have a closer connection with Laurie Strode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Jamie Lee Curtis, the performances in “Halloween” are not incredible, and the movie is far from being phenomenal. However, it was entertaining and fun to have the new generation understand, at least somewhat, the importance of a character such as Michael Myers during the Halloween season. “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is meant to be a simple film, with no complex plot that requires an in-depth analysis.

Venom’s comic book origin story. The question is, can Venom hold his own movie without his better third? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venom has Spider-Man’s eyes. Venom has powers that are mostly Spider-Man’s. I mean, come on! In Venom’s appearances in comic books, animated movie and other forms of media, he has a spider symbol on his chest just like Spider-Man! The answer to the question is a remarkably solid yes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the bigger question is how the hell did director Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”) manage to make a pretty decent movie?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent any confusion, I will avoid making any comparisons to the comic book source material. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s probably best to start from the beginning of the film, during which we’re introduced to a space shuttle crashing from the depths of the cosmos, carrying astronauts and, more notably, slimy aliens known as “symbiotes.” These symbiotes bond to other organisms by submerging their liquid bodies into the host, typically gaining full control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why bond to other organisms? Shockingly enough, these aliens can’t survive in a foreign, oxygen-rich environment like Earth. Unfortunately, symbiotes can’t just bond to any organism à la blood types and organ transplants; they need to find an exact match, or the host will die within minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our reluctant hero, journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), just so happens to be an exact match. Hardy delivers an immersive experience both as Eddie Brock and Venom and also voices the titular symbiote/symbiote-human pairing. The film delves into several inconsistently paced and edited themes. At times the film is portrayed as a horror film, as a thriller and, perhaps most frequently, as an action film. Despite the sometimes inconsistent editing of the film’s themes, Hardy manifests these themes and immerses the audience in them exceptionally well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s antagonist, CEO of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), sees a world “on the brink of collapse” and wants to use these symbiotes to forcibly evolve humanity. Though his goal is somewhat noble, Drake leaves behind no moral ambiguity, considering human beings as “disposable” and willingly subjecting humans to disturbing deaths as he tries to find the key to achieving his goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigating the Life Foundation, the Venom symbiote bonds with Brock. Brock, while attempting to manage his “guest,”  is hunted down by Drake’s men as he simultaneously assesses what the symbiote is doing to him with the help of his former girlfriend, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). As the symbiote and Brock bond physically and socially, Drake bonds with another symbiote, Riot. Brock and Venom seek to stop Drake and Riot, who set out to obtain millions of symbiotes so that Riot may take over the Earth and Drake may evolve humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fight between Venom and Riot breaks out, featuring excellent cinematography, choreography and, above all, superb special effects, all of which can be seen previously in the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, there are some editing and pacing issues (sometimes creating logic holes in the film), as well as a lack of character development, but these issues are ultimately overshadowed by Tom Hardy’s stellar performance, general direction of the film, spectacular effects, choreography and cinematography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don’t particularly enjoy the film, I’d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommend staying for the scene during the

Every time I see an emotionally-charged movie with my friends, I gloat about not shedding a single tear, even at the most heart-wrenching, gut-turning scenes. But I’m not ashamed to say I cried while watching “A Star Is Born.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps it’s a testament to the film’s ability to hit every nerve and proof that it was made with every kind of modern-day music lover in mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bradley Cooper, who also directed and produced the film, plays disenchanted country singer Jackson Maine in earnest, performing all of the songs and even earning a few writing credits on the soundtrack. His story with Ally, played by Lady Gaga, is one of the classic boy-meets-girl variety. In fact, this is the third incarnation of the “Star is Born” screenplay. Lately, it does feel like Hollywood is taking advantage of the remake and reboot format – but in Cooper’s hands, this old story feels fresh again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Maine character is a believable portrayal of an old-soul artist with deep-rooted demons. Sometimes the music helps his issues with drugs and alcohol, but more often than not, his dependency is exacerbated by his obligations to withstand long periods of time on the road for tours and an almost constant disconnection from normalcy. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a surprise: Cooper can sing. Very well. The country-tinged rock songs that his character became famous for sound like they were written for the stage, not the silver screen – which is a good thing. Cooper and co. enlisted the talents of Lukas Nelson, son of Willie Nelson, and alt-country auteur Jason Isbell to assist with the movie’s sound. Maine’s world-weary lyrics paired with his slightly weathered voice are a stunning creation by Cooper and makes for a dynamic fictional artist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga plays opposite Cooper and shines just as bright as the veteran actor in her first movie role. Of course, her portrayal of Ally mirrors some of the aspects of her real-life rise to fame. After singing in New York clubs for a number of years, she was discovered multiple times, but ran into more than a few roadblocks during her search for stardom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was criticized for her appearance, her sound and her songwriting – all things that Ally confronts during her own story arc. After Maine discovers Ally singing an enchanting rendition of “La Vie en Rose” in a drag bar, they soon find themselves swept into a whirlwind of success on each other’s behalf. Ally is skeptical of Maine’s insistence that she’ll make it. You can see a young Gaga in this character, loathing her mousy brown hair and prominent nose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is undeniable on screen and in the melding of their voices in song. Although the “Poker Face” singer is famous for her high-energy dance tracks, she was classically trained in her teenage years. Her voice is strong and instantly recognizable, but never overpowering. Although she begins her career by singing ballads with Maine, Ally eventually finds her way to pop. At one point, Maine tells Ally to ‘dig down into’ her soul for the music and never lose sight of who she is. But there’s an inherent negativity toward her newfound stardom and her sound that caters toward popular music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its glossy sheen and overt theatrics, pop music can still come from a place of authenticity. Lady Gaga the pop star is a wonderful example of this. Of course, she’s famous for the antics of her early career, like wearing dresses made of meat. But you never got the feeling that it wasn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, craziness and all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an electric chemistry between Cooper and Gaga that makes them believable as artists and a couple. The film never felt cheesy or forced because of this match, which is what makes “A Star is Born” so damn impressive. Of course, we’re rooting for Maine and Ally, but we’re able to get angry with them when they create chaos for themselves, or when they make the wrong decisions when it comes to each other. It’s easier to love characters that are imperfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cried for the sadness that Maine feels. I cried for Ally, a young woman who is forced to choose time and time again between love and her career. We know these stories by heart now, the real versions. But it takes a screen to magnify them, to show us what artists have to sacrifice to give us the art. We consume it, and we only think about their struggles when they’re laid out in front of us. But they’re in song, so clearly. Jackson and Ally – the singers, the lovers, the characters, the people – show us this.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
