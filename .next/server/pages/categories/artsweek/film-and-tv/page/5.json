The film, based on its screenwriters’ own true love story, weaves a clash of cultures, medical mystery and search for identity with the classic boy-meets-girl formula to produce a story both grounded and comical.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 3, the Carsey-Wolf Center welcomed Academy Award-nominated screenwriters, Emily V. Gordon and Nanjiani to the Pollock Theater as part of their Script to Screen series. After a screening of “The Big Sick,” the pair, who have been married since 2007, sat down with Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan to discuss the film’s script. The film has experienced extraordinary financial and critical success, becoming the most successful independent film release of 2017 and amassing countless awards, including an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nanjiani, best known for his starring role in HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” also stars as the film’s lead character, a fictitious version of himself. The character is a stand-up comedian torn between the expectations of his traditional Pakistani family and his love for Emily, an American psychology graduate student played by Zoe Kazan. The plot thickens when Emily ends up in the hospital with a mysterious illness, which results in her being placed in a medically induced coma. Emily’s coma marks the arrival of her parents, played by the legendary Holly Hunter and Ray Romano, who challenge Kumail’s issues of identity and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The pair revealed that creating the film’s script from their own story was not always an easy process. They first created a “puke draft” which consisted of 164 pages of raw, unstructured story drawn from their personal experiences. Gordon explained that adapting this version of the script would be impossible as it contained too much detail and would not translate well onto screen.</p>\n<p>“Real lives are boring,” she said “It’s the structure which makes a story interesting.”</p>\n<p>Slowly, over the course of three years, the couple edited down the story, creating a solid narrative comprised of what felt relevant to them.</p>\n<p>As they got further along in the writing process, the couple realized that some moments of their own story, which initially seemed important, did not entirely fit into the film. The duo did not mind changing or embellishing the truth, as they were not aiming to create a biopic, but the best story they could possibly tell. Gordon and Nanjiani did, however, try to sneak personal anecdotes into the film, like Kumail’s love of “The X-Files” and Emily’s favorite brain T-shirt, for example.</p>\n<p>Nanjiani noted that it was important to create a flawed when attempting to mirror himself. He explained that oftentimes when individuals are involved with the production of their own stories, the stories morph into vanity projects, portraying themselves as perfect and idealistic.</p>\n<p>“Why would I want to play someone who doesn’t grow by the end of the story?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The writing process also proved to be somewhat introspective. Nanjiani found that writing scenes based on his own family dynamic allowed him to see his parents’ perspective more clearly.</p>\n<p>On crafting characters in general, the pair elaborated that their main goal was for the audience to thoroughly understand all their characters. “</p>\n<p>You’re supposed to understand the character’s viewpoint but not agree with them,” Gordon said. “Nobody’s right, nobody’s wrong. Everyone just has different opinions.”</p>\n<p>This empathetic dogma brings layers of warmth and credibility to the film, as each character is given a sincere viewpoint rooted in genuine emotions.</p>\n<p>Portraying a real relationship was also of high importance to the screenwriters. Gordon explained that while she is a fan of romantic comedies, the relationships depicted in them kind of just fall rigidly into place. People are “more resistant” to love in real relationships. She also found that the female characters of rom-coms often come as an afterthought to their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>“The men decide everything, but they are in a relationship together,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>The couple’s commitment to an authentic script manifests itself in every scene of the hilarious comedy, which had the Pollock consumed in countless uproars of laughter throughout the screening. <em>The Big Sick</em> champions the romantic comedy genre, delivering humor, heart and reality while simultaneously staying true to its roots.</p>\n<p><em>The Big Sick</em> is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/","id":5813,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[5812,5811,5810],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Script to Screen: Jordan Peele Discusses ‘Get Out’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/v1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/v1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"To lighten the mood, Peele talked about alternate endings.

The audience experienced “Get Out” in a theater, a place that Peele found refuge in at a young age, with a new understanding as he elaborated on the challenges and triumphs of the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading up to the event, a line wrapped around the Pollock theater as fans mingled and shared their excitement. As they waited in line, students asked for extra tickets in hope of scoring a seat in one of the most highly anticipated events on campus this quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twists and reveals are Peele’s specialty. To disguise his twists, Peele uses the history of film; he takes what we expect and shatters it. Peele creates work with the audience’s reaction in mind. He explained that this mindset stems back to his comedy background in “Key and Peele.” Though he transitioned from comedy to horror, he remains conscious of the audience’s emotions and what they think is going to happen next. Still, Peele stays away from one major twist, instead focusing on a series of escalating reveals. This kept Chris’s actions smart and realistic, while also keeping the film’s rewatchability factor high as audiences would see the hidden motives and hints hidden in the first half of the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really nailed it with the casting,” Peele interjected as Ryan asked him how Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), Rose (Allison Williams) and Rod (Lil Rel Howery) were casted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Chris, Kaluuya impressed Peele with his work on the tv series “Black Mirror.” Peele assures the audience that Kaluuya never left his number-one choice for Chris. Kaluuya’s ability to express a full range of emotion was exactly what Peele was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rose, Peele was looking for a naturalistic performer, and while her background in musical theater may seem disconnected from the horror genre, Peele knew that “theater people have a bit of psychopath in them.” In the end, Williams was perfect for both aspects of Rose’s character. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, when it came to Rod, Peele was unsure who he was writing the character for until he met Howery. When Howery auditioned, Peele described it as “imperfect.” It was tough to direct him at first, but once Peele had Howery approach the lines through the lens of his stand-up comedy background, he transformed into the charismatic, funny, witty TSA cop that we see in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sunken place: Peele expands on this idea as he goes into depth of what this place entails. He describes it as a place that encapsulates a feeling worse than death, “the feeling of being trapped in your own body for eternity with no voice.” To further explain his point, he compares it to the feeling that you have when you’re falling in your sleep and you catch yourself as you suddenly wake up. He follows this with a haunting question: “What if you didn’t catch yourself? Where would you end up?” The room fell silent as that metaphor set in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lighten the mood, Peele talked about alternate endings. There were two endings that were filmed: an ending with Chris going to jail and the ending shown in the film. To our surprise, there was one more. This ending took place in a gated community rather than the ranch seen in the movie. In this scene, we would have seen Chris fighting with some final force as the screen goes black. The next scene reads “3 months later,” and it would have shown Rod breaking into the gated community and, to his surprise, he would see Chris. As Rod calls for Chris, Chris slowly turns and says, “I assure you, I don’t know who you’re talking to.” This ending implies that Chris lost in his last fight for freedom and has undergone the brain transplant surgery. With that said, I am glad it ended the way Peele ultimately chose. However, it is interesting to see where the ending could have gone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Q&amp;A came to a close, Peele disclosed some facts about himself that gave the audience a better understanding of who he is. He explained how when he was a kid, he would go to the movie theater after school, and he described it as his church. One movie that stuck with him was “Edward Scissorhands.” Peele explained that he appreciated the “acute vision” Tim Burton explored as every concept came together perfectly. The fact that the main character was an outcast also intrigued him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Peele continues to make movies, he will introduce themes and ideas that have never been done before. The troupe of the white savior was not represented in this film which is unheard of given that there is at least one in every film in the movie industry.

After some attendees worked for hours to secure their spots outside The Arlington Theatre, the crowd’s anticipation was brought to an absolute high when they greeted the actors stepping out of their blacked-out Escalades. The camaraderie displayed amongst the group of stars was shown through moments such as John Boyega’s imitation of Pinocchio from “Shrek” to Kumail Nanjiani’s timely, comedic jabs at the other actors.</p>\n<p>This year’s Virtuosos Award recipients included Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”), John Boyega (“Detroit”), Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me By Your Name”), Hong Chau (“Downsizing”), Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out”) and Kumail Nanjiani (“The Big Sick”).</p>\n<p>The night began with SBIFF Director Roger Durling announcing that recipient Gal Gadot (“Wonder Woman”) would not be in attendance due to a case of the flu. This did not seem to temper the audience’s excitement, as their eager faces waited to hear the rest of the lineup speak about working on their Oscar-nominated films. Dave Karger moderated the event for the eighth consecutive year and briefly spoke about the natural calamity faced by the Santa Barbara and Montecito communities. “I know that it has not been an easy few months and I just hope that we can provide you all with a couple hours of joy and entertainment,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After Karger announced that Mary J. Blige was “the first person to ever be nominated for acting and songwriting for the same movie in the same year,” the artist received a standing ovation from the audience. Blige described the utter shock of finding out she was nominated for two Oscars, one for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Florence in the Netflix film “Mudbound” and the other for her Best Original Song for her song “Mighty River.”</p>\n<p>Blige cited her New York upbringing and Southern roots in helping her role as the Mississippi-raised Florence flourish on screen. Blige’s portrayal of the matriarch is one that challenges prejudice and acts as a mission statement for the future. Blige said playing Florence served as a healing process. “It gave me a place to give all the heaviness that I felt trapped in, and let Florence have every single pain and every confusion,” she said.  Blige confidently confirmed that she will be singing “Mighty River” on the Oscars telecast, comparing this reality to a dream that she expects someone to pinch her out of.</p>\n<p>John Boyega’s role as Melvin Dismukes in “Detroit” created a platform from which to speak against the police brutality experienced by black men in the 1967 Detroit riots. Much like fellow Virtuosos award recipient Daniel Kaluuya’s performance in “Get Out,” Boyega and Kaluuya’s characters were portraits of racial tragedies and injustice. Boyega exuded the confidence of a seasoned actor as he charismatically waltzed onto the stage and gushed about being in Santa Barbara for the first time. Karger asked Boyega about the intricate performance he gave during an interrogation scene in “Detroit” where his character’s hands are trembling with insecurity and nervousness. Boyega recalled how meeting Melvin Dismukes affected his honest portrayal of a man who experienced a pivotal time in history: “A big thing was trying to get to know him separate from his circumstance in the movie. I noticed that he was an introvert, which gave me a clue on how to navigate a performance like that.” Despite being a British actor playing an American man, Boyega did not choose to adopt a method style of acting. He stated that whenever he had a break from shooting, “dropping the accent meant dropping the intensity of the role.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80887\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1054904681\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80885\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80887\" data-attachment-id=\"80887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/mask-thomas-fire-by-sicheng-wang-online-24/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=2000%2C1330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1330\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF by Joshua Wu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80887\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Get Out’ star Daniel Kaluuya posing on the red carpet at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival Virtuosos Awards. <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Boyega received a rousing of applause when he stated that people should not be apprehensive about watching “Detroit” because, “This is our mess;

The American actor, nominated for an Academy Award, was recognized at the SBIFF for his roles in ‘Call Me By Your Name’ and ‘Lady Bird.’ <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Chalamet handles Karger’s questions in a way similar to the quirky awkwardness of a character in a coming-of-age indie film. His reaction to Karger inquiring about the infamous peach scene in<em> “</em>Call Me By Your Name” was met with slight laughter, accompanied by the sarcastic, “I have been waiting for this moment my whole life!” Chalamet says he did three takes for the last scene of the film, where he is seated by a fireplace as Sufjan Stevens’s “Visions of Gideon” acts as a consoling backdrop to his crying. Luca Guadagnino has pondered about possibly making a sequel to “Call Me By Your Name,” and Chalamet says he will be on board with the project. “I mean yeah, that would mean employment,” he said.</p>\n<p>Clad in Gucci loafers, Daniel Kaluuya, stepped onto the stage, giving a shou-tout to three-time Academy Award nominee “Get Out” director Jordan Peele. Kaluuya states that Peele was hesitant to give the part of Chris to a British actor as he felt it was particular to an African-American storyline.</p>\n<p>“If you leave the M25 in Britain, it’s “Get Out.” I live this. He [Peele] uses African-American voice and perspective to tap into a universal black truth navigating a Western construct,” Kaluuya said. Kaluuya’s way of portraying Chris, a man who is plagued with confusion, denial and trauma amidst a falsely idyllic family was by “thinking with emotions and music.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Sick’s” Kumail Nanjiani had the audience in fits of laughter. He compared making “The Big Sick” to getting out the last bits of ketchup from out of a bottle. “It was like a bottle of old ketchup that you have to slap the back of,” he said. “And the congealed piece comes out, and finally the rest will come out. This movie was the congealed piece.” He spoke on co-writing the break-up scene that “The Big Sick’s” storyline revolves around with his wife, Emily V. Gordon: “It was interesting when I was writing the break-up scene and I thought I was making some great points, but when I got the rewrite, Emily was making some great points as well.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80889\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1753104709\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80885\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80889\" data-attachment-id=\"80889\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/mask-thomas-fire-by-sicheng-wang-online-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=2000%2C1330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1330\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF by Dafan Huang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80889\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Detroit’ star John Boyega at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nanjiani also addressed the long-term effects of Gordon’s illness and beamed about how the happiness he felt for Gordon’s Oscar nomination superseded the happiness he felt over his: “The first thing I felt when we received the Oscar nomination was such pride in her. I was like ‘oh my god, the person I love most is nominated for an Academy Award.’ She fought through so much to be rewarded in this way. I’m just so proud of her.”</p>\n<p>The group discussion that followed was an amalgamation of Kaluuya doing an impression of Will Smith laughing on a talk show, Chalamet desperately trying to show everyone proof that Matthew McConaughey left a voicemail on his phone, Nanjiani humorously mocking Chalamet’s portrayal of C-3PO, Boyega revealing his love for K-pop and Blige voicing her desire to become the new Princess Leia.</p>\n<p>The recipients of the 2018 Virtuosos Award provided a fascinating unpredictability that had the audience on edge of their seats, ready to laugh and leaving them reluctant to leave the escape of a Hollywood party at the Arlington Theatre. This year’s group of Virtuosos provided a warm presence that made the audience feel like they were sharing a drink with friends — and it just so happens that these friends are Oscar nominees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/","id":5810,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5809,5808,5807],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The End of the F***ing World: A Teenage Rebellion","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EOTFW-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EOTFW-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore.

Yes, it’s very reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, except that it’s not entirely. James proclaims himself as a sociopath within the first 40 seconds of the show, taking pleasure in killing small animals and self-inflicting pain (showing off an entire burnt hand to prove it). He later explains that he engages in these behaviors in order to make himself feel something after witnessing his mother’s suicide. Except now, he’s ready to move on to bigger targets. This is where Alyssa comes in, a brazen girl with a strong IDGAF attitude battling her own issues at home.</p>\n<p>The pilot wastes no time in jumping to the “boy meets girl” trope and executes it in a brilliantly humorous and blunt way; it may be one of my favorite introductions in television history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen you skating,” Alyssa says to James in the school cafeteria. “You’re pretty shit.”</p>\n<p>James response?</p>\n<p>“Fuck off.”</p>\n<p>As the pilot progresses, we discover that while James is fantasizing about Alyssa becoming his first human murder, she begins to grow comfortable with him, even saying he’s someone she could fall in love with. If that’s not depressing, then I don’t know what is. Evidently enough, Alyssa easily sways James into ditching town with her and he goes along for the ride, as he finds it the perfect opportunity to murder her. By the end of the episode, the two hop in James’s dad’s car and embark on a road trip that promptly becomes more of an impulsive crime spree (the “armed” robbery is hands down one of my favorite scenes) as they search for Alyssa’s father.</p>\n<p>The show moves back and forth between perspectives, providing deeper insight in getting to know our antiheroine and antihero. Through the characters’ inner monologues, done wonderfully through voiceovers, we gain a deeper understanding of their personalities. James’s thoughts convey a monotone indifference to match his perpetually disturbed yet aloof façade; Alyssa, on the hand, is quite multifaceted.</p>\n<p>Despite her aggressively upfront, careless approach (throwing curses shamelessly at the world, rolling her eyes at anything and everything), thoughts expose her as vulnerable and wounded. It’s comical as viewers to watch how vastly different these two characters are; Alyssa is all nihilistic spunk and spontaneity while James is merely a bystander to all her wayward antics.</p>\n<p>At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore. They’re brimming with a bleak resentment to an awful society, taking out their frustrations and fragilities in a manner that’s both droll and gloomy.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this story so oddly beautiful is the human connection that is made between two people who seem so, well, inhuman. It’s when Alyssa somehow finds her way back to James and when James somehow can’t bring himself to leave Alyssa in spite of her mad father — it’s these moments that display how much they’ve come to care for each other. The sinister events that follow their escape and mutual feeling of adolescent confusion tie them together, a bond that can’t be broken. No matter how deranged the story is, it’s a story of love.</p>\n<p>Overall, “The End of the F***ing World” provides all the essentials for an indie teen flick: a road trip, a banging soundtrack, running from the authorities, two underdogs we <em>really shouldn’t be rooting for</em>, but do anyway … and an honorary mention to the wardrobe change mid-season (a Hawaiian shirt makes for a perfect disguise, right?).</p>\n<p>However, all this would not be so easy to binge in an entire day if it weren’t for the compelling acting of the two leads. Barden pins the tail right on the donkey with her character; while playing a bratty teenage girl with issues sounds derivative and cliché, it’s done with a complexity one simply can’t help but love. I fear her, but I also just want to be her mom friend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lawther’s performance is phenomenal, capturing all the subtle intricacies that make James so disconcerting and intriguing to watch (I expected nothing less after seeing him on “Black Mirror”). As each episode briskly passes by, it becomes hard to not fall for the charms of the duo.</p>\n<p>Writer Charlie Covell and director Jonathan Entwistle remarkably capture the genuine connection that evolves between Alyssa and James. It’s a fast-paced story, jumping from one mishap to another, with side narratives that thankfully do not detract from the main plot — everything is well interwoven until the very end of the series. Right when you become engrossed into this explicitly dark, dark world, it all comes to an end, and eight episodes suddenly feels far too short.</p>\n<p>It’s unlike any show I’ve seen on television; it’s the perfect storm of teenage rebellion to a heightened ending. Despite the ambiguous finale that leaves the viewer in a stupor, desperately itching for more, it’s hard to envision continuing this world after the helter-skelter chaos of one season. Bravo Alyssa and James, for making a love story truly feel like the end of the fucking world.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/","id":5809,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[5808,5807,5806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Loving Vincent’ Captures Van Gogh in Motion","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":" Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Loving Vincent,” by directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, functions oddly as a work of art. It is by no means a bad film; in fact, by many measures, it is a masterpiece. Inspired by the life and work of Vincent van Gogh, “Loving Vincent” is the first fully painted feature film. Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours. Their work and talent is manifested in the film, which is never anything less than visually stunning. That is the ‘how’ of the movie, and it is beyond reproach. As a work of visual art, “Loving Vincent” deserves to be seen by everyone with even a passing interest in Vincent van Gogh.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, “Loving Vincent” is not a painting. It is a movie, and as a movie, it is rarely more than, well, fine. The movie is never atrociously bad. “Loving Vincent” follows Armand, the son of Vincent van Gogh’s postman, as he attempts to deliver Van Gogh’s last letter, a year after van Gogh’s death.  In the process of finding the rightful owner of the letter, Armand learns more about the man and is drawn into the mystery of van Gogh’s apparent suicide. What follows is a meandering and low-stakes murder mystery that feels utterly inconsequential — even in the basic description of the movie’s plot, it begins to feel like a little bit of a stretch. The protagonist has too little to do with the subject. The story is not enticing, and it has little narrative drive. Great effort is made to incorporate the subjects of van Gogh’s actual paintings into the narrative. The thought of that is nice, but it only slows the plot even further. In this movie, every frame is a memorial of the great artist, and every time it is to the expense of the elements of a film that typically differentiate film from the other visual mediums.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"190192479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79341\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79342\" data-attachment-id=\"79342\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/vg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vg…\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79342\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The movie is about a murder mystery a year removed from all of the action, which is already centuries removed from us. It begs the question: “Why am I watching this? This is not interesting.” Van Gogh is only present in the occasional black and white flashback, so for a movie dedicated as a monument to the painter, we see frustratingly little of him. We mostly hear about him, through the mouths of all the characters he knew and painted. Thus the movie finds itself making the critical mistake of showing nearly nothing and telling almost everything. The mistake is especially confounding when the basic premise of the movie is its visual potency. It is a gorgeous film, but it is mostly a film of talking heads. What I would give for a more kinetic film in this style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The performances in the film are fine. They’re an odd mix of live action and animation, as actors performed the scenes on soundstages for the animators to paint over. The actors fill their painted world with little charms, but can do little to elevate their material to any sense of urgency or importance. It’s hard for the actors to get over the fact that all of their lines are biographical exposition.</p>\n<p>I’m left with an odd feeling after watching the film. There are many things that stuck out to me as mistakes. There are many things about it that I will gleefully criticize because, in many ways, it is a bad movie.</p>\n<p>But I loved it.</p>\n<p>In spite of all of its flaws as a film, it was an entrancing experience. The amount of love that went into it over a period of years is palpable. The love can be felt in the soft, ever-so-slightly changing brush strokes and in the credits as I watched the names of hundreds of artists fly by. The movie is, warts and all, an impressive testament to the lasting powers of art and the impression it has made on so many people through so many years. From van Gogh to the directors, the directors to their team of tireless painters and the painters to us.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, there is a scene where two drunks get into a fight. It’s a relatively complicated shot, with the camera weaving between the two figures. Here is when the illusion of the film is at its strongest, where the two art forms meet. As it stands, “Loving Vincent” is only a masterpiece of painting and a mediocre film. The movie shies away from motion most of the time, leaving it static like a painting. If it committed to its hybrid nature more often and strived to be a movie worth engaging with as well as art worth watching, it would be truly sublime.</p>\n<p>As it is, it is only beautiful.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/","id":5806,"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen"},"related":[5805,5804,5803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Blade Runner 2049’ Creates a New Future from the Same Story","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Blade Runner 2049” is not a pretty picture of the future. Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements. Apartment building hallways are cramped with the homeless and sick. Flying, heavily armed cars race across the sky as oppressive, electronic tones courtesy of Hans Zimmer blast in your ears. It tells you immediately that the world you see in front of you is oppressive, unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this neo-noir destitution, artificially created humans called “replicants” continue to be produced for slave labor. Specialized LAPD detectives called “blade runners” hunt down the older models, many of whom just want to be left alone.</p>\n<p>Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is one such “blade runner.” It quickly becomes clear that K is not a particularly remarkable person; he’s very robotic, stone-faced and unemotional. Although he occasionally questions the ethics of his job, he still carries it out, believing he has no choice in the matter. Even if the film doesn’t dig too deep into initial motivations, K still serves as the catalyst by which the film asks questions regarding the nature of the human and the artificial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For instance, take K’s holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas). Although copied and pasted from a mass-produced template and encoded onto a thumb drive for the sake of portability, Joi manages to demonstrate a degree of self-awareness. In a stroke of brevity and intelligence, the film never quite makes it clear if her growing independence evolved by itself or was programmed into her. Even though she has at least a small degree of freedom of movement, Joi yearns to overcome her existence as a mere product, seeking emotional fulfillment. I’m not familiar with Ana de Armas or her work, but I think she certainly has the chops to tackle more dramatic roles in the future if she so wishes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79204\" style=\"width: 1915px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1547592895\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79203\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79204\" data-attachment-id=\"79204\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/unnamed-46/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=1905%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1905,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=888%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79204\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=888%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1905&amp;ssl=1 1905w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Movie Database</p></div>\n<p>This desire to be human, or to transcend it, is the thread holding the entire post-Ridley Scott tapestry together. What looks like a very bland story on paper — a cop uncovers a conspiracy with huge ramifications for society — delves into K’s past and forces him to ask himself questions about himself and what it all means for him and for the replicants. The movie continues the story from the original “Blade Runner” in a fascinating way that subversively pulls on tried-and-true sci-fi tropes.</p>\n<p>In the process of K’s investigation, we are introduced to Jared Leto in a role that allows him to spout the most forgettable philosophy babble I’ve heard since “Transcendence.” He’s the face behind the faceless entity that is corporate greed, and as antagonists go, he’s not up to snuff. He emotes very little and there is hardly any backstory present to flesh him out. His henchwoman Luv comes across as more complex, if perhaps a little contradictory. Perhaps, if you listen closely as Leto goes on about the nature of replicants in his silky tones, you might find yourself being lulled into a nap.</p>\n<p>On the flip side of Mr. ASMR, “2049” brings back original “Blade Runner” protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). While Deckard doesn’t show up until toward the end of the second act, he ties into K’s story in a fascinating, even subversive way that pulls from the events and consequences of the original film. Anyone looking to catch a bone regarding the long-persisting theory regarding whether or not Deckard’s a replicant isn’t going to find anything to gnaw on. It’s no longer his story to question the nature of humanity but instead the implications of it being able to evolve.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, the movie is not just a philosophical slog, I promise. You’re still going to get some shootouts and good ol’ robot fisticuff brawling. There’s entertainment to be had, but this isn’t joining the likes of “Fury Road” and “The Force Awakens” among the pantheon of 30-years-later blockbuster action sequels. “Blade Runner 2049” takes its time to get to its payoff — perhaps a little too much time. There’s so much excess that an entire subplot alluding to a replicant revolution goes absolutely nowhere. Sequel bait, perhaps? “Blade Runner 2079”?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/","id":5800,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5799,5798,5797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Marshall’ Tackles Racism with Simplicity and Warmth","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its most basic plot summary, “Marshall” concerns two lawyers working a difficult case. NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall and insurance lawyer Sam Friedman are the defense in the case of Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur accused of the rape and attempted murder of his boss’s wife — who is white — in the 1940s segregationist America. The judge compounds the difficulty of their situation by ruling that Marshall cannot speak during the trial, justifying this by stating he’s an out-of-state lawyer.</p>\n<p>Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client is innocent, while arguing in a court with a white judge, jury and prosecution. The odds are astronomically stacked against them, making this very much an underdog story. This is magnified especially since Marshall is fighting on behalf of civil rights, all while risking the reputation of the NAACP by taking on the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79206\" style=\"width: 2157px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1444187541\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79205\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79206\" data-attachment-id=\"79206\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/unnamed-1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=2147%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2147,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C532&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79206\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C533\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=2147&amp;ssl=1 2147w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C614&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79206\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Broadway Filmore Alive</p></div>\n<p>Even though Marshall and Friedman come from two different social backgrounds and types of legal practices, they have more in common than they think.

Friedman makes it clear that he is neither experienced enough nor happy to be the leading defensive attorney, and Marshall is very much frustrated at having to continually pester Friedman into defending Spell. As the film goes on and their friendship grows, the two wring some warm comedy out of one another, Marshall setting up one particularly rib-tickling joke about Friedman’s courtroom prowess.</p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman of “Black Panther” and Josh Gad play the two lawyers. According to director Reginald Hudlin, who spoke to Durling at the screening, Boseman was reluctant to take on another historical role after “42” and “Get on Up.” But after reading the script, he was on board to play the Supreme Court justice. He portrays Marshall with a weaponized, steely confidence that makes him immune to the prejudice he encounters. He’s unwilling to give up and bow down despite the daunting odds that he is confronted with. Nevertheless, he is still made vulnerable by tragedies that arise within his own family.</p>\n<p>Gad subtly makes it clear in his first scene, a small courtroom case, that Friedman feels unfulfilled and maybe even a little ashamed about being an insurance lawyer. When he has the opportunity to do some good, he is immediately concerned for his reputation and his family. As he and Marshall dig deeper into the case, Friedman becomes more involved both in Spell’s case and the greater issue of civil rights. Like Marshall, his own family must deal with personal tragedy, his own tied to the conquests of the Nazis.</p>\n<p>At times, though, the film to steers into melodrama. One hokey scene has Marshall stand on the steps of the courthouse and make a big speech about the Constitution to assembled reporters as dramatic music plays. It’s a little much, but the film brings the tone back around through Spell. Sterling K. Brown does a sublime job at playing a terrified man whose innocence is very much in question. His skin color is serving to continue to make his life a living hell. He makes this clear in court with an impassioned speech on what could happen to him as a black man, moving even the ambiguously racist judge (played by James Cromwell).</p>\n<p>The film is based on a true story, with heavy creative input from Friedman’s daughter (who portrays, ironically enough, a racist). As with many films like this one, it’s difficult to discern what is 100 percent true, but that does not take away from the film at all. At the film screening in the Riviera Theatre, Hudlin said he wanted to make a film that would make people come out and tell their friends, “Aw, that movie was so good!” and not “That movie’s really important, you gotta see it.”</p>\n<p>“Marshall” is entertaining, socially relevant and delivers doses of humor to balance out the gravity of the subject matter.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/","id":5801,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5800,5799,5798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Netflix Anime ‘Neo Yokio’ Is Weird Yet Worthwhile","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508&ssl=1","description":"\"Neo Yokio,\" or the Japanese form of \"New York,\" blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 1912, Japan gifted Manhattan with 2,500 cherry blossom trees in what is now known as Sakura Park. The beautiful flowers that bloom on the trees are a very powerful symbol in Japanese culture, and the gift was meant to establish a lasting peace and friendship between the two countries. Fast forward to 2017 and the trees have grown and evolved in the new context of a bustling New York City, and Sakura Park stands as a living, breathing example of cultural unity. Despite some fluctuation in international relations, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig has intricately crafted his weird, quirky and creatively flawed internet-era version of Sakura Park. His new anime Netflix Original starring Jaden Smith is “Neo Yokio,” an imperfect yet extremely dynamic model of the exaggerated tropes of both New York and Japanese cultures. The work is a living culture shock, and although not worthy of high regard or reward, it is more than anything commendable for its creative liberties and merely the fact that it even exists in the first place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio,” or the Japanese form of “New York,” blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force. These three seemingly random movements, however, have been blending together for quite some time now. Recently, we have been seeing SoundCloud rappers with anime-ridden profiles, and the clothing brand A Bathing Ape is more prevalent than ever in the states. Rapper Lil Uzi Vert (who happens to look like an anime character himself) posts about “Cowboy Bebop” on his Instagram, and of course, the cult-classic anime-meets-black-television show, “The Boondocks,” remains a legendary piece of small screen history. But “Neo Yokio” seems to directly blend cultures more than ever before, so much so that it has become the main attraction of the show.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio” follows the extremely wealthy socialite and coveted bachelor Kaz Kaan, who is voiced by Jaden Smith. Kaz frequently wears high fashion brands such as Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, he is the star of his preppy field hockey team, he attends high-class parties and balls and he gets flown around town by his robot butler. His Aunt Agatha, voiced by Susan Sarandon, looks out for him and arranges appointments for his other important hobby, exorcizing demons. This leads to the first main issue with “Neo Yokio”; it has way too much going on. The work often struggles to navigate back and forth between socialite life, young city life and the wild card of demon exorcism. However, this excess does not prevent the show from maintaining excitement, commentary, occasional humor and unique style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Outside of the saturated and scattered plot, “Neo Yokio” finds more value visually and stylistically more than anything else. The show looks beautiful on screen, and the creative character design works well in front of quality voice acting, specifically from Jaden Smith. Much like the enigmatic young prodigy, the show constantly finds redeeming moments of weird yet profound intelligence and artistry. Quotes like, “Who cares what time it is when the future is an interminable abyss of wackiness?” and “Demon be gone from this Chanel suit!” are examples of the kind of perplexing weirdness that, whether you like or not, can be appreciated.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79105\" style=\"width: 825px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1921343512\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79105\" data-attachment-id=\"79105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/unnamed-45/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"815,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79105\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?w=815&amp;ssl=1 815w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Behind all the nonsense and randomness of this fascinating creation, there is a deeper commentary on materiality, elitism, capitalism and fandom. Throughout the colorful landscapes of Neo Yokio, Kaz is frequently seen worrying about comically insignificant things, including wearing a midnight blue suit to a black and white ball, the rundown status of his childhood home in the Hamptons and his constant belittling for being “neo-riche.” He also constantly refers to his ex-girlfriend, Cathy, who he can’t seem to get over. In this sense, Kaz functions as a modern-day animated Hamlet, coming from extreme wealth and constantly distraught and complaining about love and the world around him. This character functions well in the New York context, a clear critique of the materialistic and elitist culture that upscale cities maintain. A more direct critique of this is Neo Yokio’s list of most eligible bachelors, which appears to be a nod to “One Punch Man”’s hero rankings. In Neo Yokio, young male bachelors are ranked in a fluctuating list posted in the middle of the city. Kaz is seen going up and down on this list throughout the show, greatly influencing his perception in the public eye as well as his general happiness. This is not only a fascinating dialogue about the elite social classes in modern society, but also an interesting response to the mixed reviews that the show has been receiving. Elements like these are some of the quirks that make “Neo Yokio” a success in its details, rather than the big picture.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As far as traditional anime is concerned, “Neo Yokio” is nothing revolutionary or even memorable on a narrative level. “Neo Yokio” is more than just weird, as it also often can be choppy, strange and lacking fluidity in storytelling. This show may often bring the audience to laugh when they’re not supposed to, be taken aback by the dialogue and question what even just happened on-screen. Despite these things, “Neo Yokio” demands a watch and, more importantly, a discussion because of its unique ability to blend cultures, create profound creative moments, provoke thought and make memories. Whether or not it resonates with you or at times even succeeds to make sense, “Neo Yokio” guarantees an experience that is memorable and by all means entertaining.</p>\n<p>This is a show that, despite mixed critical reception and even accusations of appropriation, should be appreciated and enjoyed for its role in blending cultures. Even more so, we should celebrate the fact that Ezra Koenig made an anime with Jaden Smith about a demon-exorcising socialite in New York and was able to have Netflix fund it. We should celebrate the fact that we live in a time where strange art like this can be created and distributed at such a high rate. We should also celebrate the fact that, in an ever-divisive world, strange art like this has an audience. Perhaps it has less historical significance and general impact on the world than the real Sakura Park, but the ridiculous and outrageous “Neo Yokio” is still worthy of our attention and should be celebrated for its cultural push.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/","id":5788,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5787,5786,5785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Netflix’s Newest Fantasy Series ‘Castlevania’ Has Bite, But Only a Nibble","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-07-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=980%2C578&ssl=1","description":"Netflix's \"Castlevania\" series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix’s “Castlevania”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.

One year later, his giant bat-thing minions are romping around, eating babies, killing peasants and just generally having a grand ol’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Trevor Belmont (Armitage), the whip-wielding vampire hunter with amusingly triangular beard hair and a laughably neat scar over his left eye that often looks purple in the right lighting. Besides being a disappointingly standard reluctant hero, Belmont also serves as the primary exposition machine, almost constantly spouting information about his family in order to explain his character motivations. Because screw nuance and mystery, let’s just tell everyone outright who the hell this guy is and why he’s doing stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not even an interesting enough story here to utilize Belmont to any interesting degree. In fact, it’s just as standard and cookie-cutter as he is: a hero who doesn’t care about anyone ends up in town. He meets people. He gives a shit. He defends the town. End. Yay! Although perhaps the show can be given credit to adhering more to Western clichés than fantasy ones.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78589\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1267486673\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78588\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78589\" data-attachment-id=\"78589\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=1308%2C578&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1308,578\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=888%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78589 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1-1024x453.png?resize=888%2C393\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C453&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could have potentially remedied this uninspired tale was if any of the secondary characters were able to compensate for Belmont’s dull characterization. Alas, no. Belmont does not interact with very many people and when he does, it’s often just to provide more exposition. His exchange with a villainous bishop (Matt Frewer, who seems to be taking a lot of influence from Tony Jay’s performance in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”) wrangles little tension, the paramount moment of said conversation amounting the bishop to basically just telling Belmont, “Go away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the best part of the show is its ending, and no, not because it’s over. Belmont and the mage Sypha (Alejandra Reynoso) come across a fan-favorite character and fight him in the season’s final boss battle (after only four episodes, unfortunately). The fight between Belmont and said character is enjoyably frenetic, demonstrating their superhuman abilities to their full degrees and revealing the nature of their characters. It’s a much more satisfying conclusion than a prior battle that the entire season was building up to, which comes and goes with an “eh.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Story aside, what may have been the second-biggest draw for some people was the show being animated. Oftentimes, animation can be the superior medium to deliver a fantasy story, as it forgoes having to build extravagant sets and blow a fortune on CGI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here though, the animation is about on par with your average modern anime. People and creatures are all drawn, whereas the backgrounds are all obviously computer generated. But with the characters being consistently on-model and some killer lighting (evoking fellow vampire series “Hellsing Ultimate” at points), it gets the job done, even if every so often, there are a couple small mishaps involving mechanical lips and wonky arms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering it’s tantalizingly short length, “Castlevania” is better off being binged as a film, maybe on a boring summer day, because this is not Netflix’s big new hit by any means. It’s fun at times, but it does not exceed in any particular area to be considered anything other than a light snack. The series itself is also, I think, too old for our age group to cull any personal investment in seeing the famous game series be adapted to television.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung likes the movie “Super Marios Bros.,” so take his opinion with a grain of salt. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78588\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78588\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/","id":5785,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5784,5783,5782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Wonder Woman’ Carries the DC Universe Forward","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges towa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Wonder Woman” has finally arrived with the weight of DC’s future resting upon her shoulders. But has director Patty Jenkins been able to finally break the chain of critical flops, from that of “Batman v Superman” to that of “Suicide Squad?” Have our beloved childhood comic-book heroes finally been released from the poisonous grip of Zack Snyder? Well, it’s a bit difficult to say. For the most part the answer is yes; “Wonder Woman” is far from being a letdown. The film, which is at times incredible and at other times questionable, is more of a successful bunt than it is a home-run, with the folks at DC taking a very cautious and careful step forward toward critical redemption. The result is a well-executed yet formulaic film that abides by the many tired conventions of the comic book form, leaving little room for innovation and frustrating anyone looking for a fresh new take on the comic book genre. Still, for anyone looking for a fun, fast-paced action-adventure blockbuster, then this is exactly what you’ve been looking for. But for those of us who wish for something more from their comic-book films, you’ll be left wanting just a little bit more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1645836084\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78366\"><img data-attachment-id=\"78367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=936%2C334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"936,334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=888%2C317&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=888%2C317\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=768%2C274&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The good news is that there are plenty of aspects to enjoy about the film. Each and every location and act, save the final CGI airfield mess, is incredibly entertaining, at least on a surface level. From the beautiful Amazonian home of Themyscira, which showcases some of the film’s more outlandish and entertaining sequences (when will you ever again get to watch Amazon warriors face off against villainous Germans?) to the solemn war-torn fields of the Eastern Front, the film has its fair share of exotic locales and engrossing scenarios.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The issue here is the film’s jittery pace, as it never wants to stand still and take a breather. Halfway through the movie you’ll feel like you’ve tasted 20 different flavors of drastically different films, but you’re never allowed to stay and watch any one of them long enough to be satisfied. Between action sequences that mirror the adventures of Indiana Jones and the London alleyways that echo political spy thrillers, the film can never seem to decide on which movie it wants to be. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because each small snippet of genre, from fantasy to war, is relatively well-done. But having less than five minutes of screen time designated to the trenches of World War I can leave some with an unquenched thirst. Regardless, between its various moments of exhilaration, the film does a more than satisfactory job of keeping your attention focused, even if it all just feels like it’s skimming the surface of something that could have been even more worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The best scenes of the film are those that take the time to slow down, and these scenes are mostly shared between Gal Gadot (Diana aka Wonder Woman) and Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) as they confront the moral complexities of war. The contrasting of Trevor’s first-hand understanding of the horrors of war with Diana’s naïve black-and-white morality brings out the much deeper themes that the film desperately needs. Pine’s monologues on the nature of war are especially moving. One of the best sequences I’ve ever seen in a comic-book film has the two leads dancing in a war-torn village as snow begins to fall. Diana asks Trevor what people do when there isn’t any war to fight. He responds that they eat breakfast, read the paper, get married and do other mundane things typical of a peaceful time. When she asks him what it’s like to do such things, he wearily responds, “I have no idea.” The war runs deep in these scenes and shapes our leads into better characters. It’s a shame that the film barely addresses these issues, as these dramatic and heart-breaking moments bring out the best in Gadot’s performance and showcases the best the film has to offer. Moments like these are lovingly crafted by Jenkins.</p>\n<p>With a rather large and diverse cast, “Wonder Woman” establishes many great characters, although they’re accompanied by a few unfortunate duds. The standout here is clearly Pine’s character of Steve Trevor. Pine is funny, charming, courageous and downright inspirational (and as my girlfriend pointed out, downright cute). I wouldn’t be surprised if Pine used this performance as his audition tape for the next Indiana Jones. The subtleness in his acting, alongside his ability to make even the most ridiculous of scenes seem plausible, allows Pine to ultimately steal the spotlight. While his role in the film is structurally set up to support the overall progression of Gadot’s character and narrative, the film is arguably just as much Trevor’s story as it is Wonder Woman’s, which may be a problem for some.</p>\n<p>Gadot’s Wonder Woman is the hardest character to evaluate. While she performs feats of incredible strength and frequently takes control of her own decisions, charging into battle to save the lives of those in need, the character is equally as often presented as a naïve and almost “ditsy” character. While this “fish-out-of-water” personality fits within the narrative and is quite charming to watch, it makes it hard to distinguish Gadot’s acting ability from the youthful naivety of her character. Paired with her accent, some lines come out as just sounding off.</p>\n<p>But for the most part, Gadot can hold more than her own. She’s brave, sweet and can even pull out a surprising dramatic flair in some of her more emotional scenes. Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges toward the trenches of war has lost a part of their childhood <em>wonder</em>. It goes without saying that Gadot is a new inspirational action hero, not just for a female audience but for the general public as well.</p>\n<p>The supporting cast varies in talent. Robin Wright, who plays Wonder Woman’s mentor, Antiope, is absolutely amazing. Her stern kindness and sly grin, flashing in the face of battle, make the short time spent with her character immensely enjoyable. David Thewlis is also as calming and talented as ever, even though his character sputters out in the last act. Eugene Brave Rock as the Chief, however, is shockingly terrible. There haven’t been too many performances that I have audibly laughed at before, and I can only suggest that aspiring actors use his performance as a case study for how not to act in a film. The villains, Danny</p>\n<p>Huston’s Ludendorff and Elena Anaya’s Dr. Maru, are disappointingly misused in the film. Ludendorff, while convincingly acted, is just another addition to the throwaway comic-book movie villain fodder, and together with Dr. Maru, the two act more like the laughable villains of a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. It’s a shame, too, because Anaya’s Dr. Maru is absolutely chilling in her few brief appearances and could have made a memorable female supervillain if she hadn’t been ultimately cast aside for an unnecessary CGI slugfest.</p>\n<p>“Wonder Woman” is far from a bad film. There are barely any major issues outside of a forced third act and an annoying absence of development and quiet time for our characters. But an absence of glaring issues does not mean that the film is great, or even very good. The film at its best is a fun popcorn flick. Beyond its period setting, “Wonder Woman” isn’t very different from your run-of-the-mill comic book fare. The grouping up of our heroes to face off against an undeveloped super-baddie is just so overdone at this point that the outcome is exhausting. There’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before.</p>\n<p>In a sense, “Wonder Woman” has saved the DCEU for Warner Brothers, <em>with</em> its glowing praise and an enormous opening. But at what cost? The company’s answer to the scathing reviews and steep revenue drop-offs of its former DC films is in the form of a relatively safe and formulaic picture. While the film may surpass the quality of its predecessors and even overcome a few of the Marvel features, it nevertheless cripples itself to the expectations set by the typical comic book venture, forcing “Wonder Woman” to shy away from its more engrossing and deeper themes. Nearly a decade after Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” critics and audiences seem to have greatly lowered their expectations for what a comic book film could be. Even though “Wonder Woman” is far from being a bad film, passing up plenty of its comic contemporaries, we shouldn’t have to lower our standards for our childhood superheroes due to the genre’s often mediocre result. While “Wonder Woman” isn’t mediocre, it still isn’t great and holds on as tight as it possibly can to the prospect of being good. Still, the film is a step in the right direction, albeit a very cautious one.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, “Wonder Woman” is still incredibly enjoyable to watch and is probably the best movie out right now. You can’t help but smile when her incredibly energetic theme song fills the theater.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most cynical of us will always wonder to ourselves what could have been.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78366\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78366\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/","id":5786,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5785,5784,5783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Dead Men’ Could Have Told A Better Tale Than This","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Dead Men Tell No Tales” thinks you are very, very stupid.

The Trident, conveniently enough, has the power to break any curse. So Henry goes looking for Jack Sparrow in the hopes of recruiting his help and runs into the scientifically inclined Carina, whom he swears he is not in love with.

The movie lets the principle of “show, don’t tell” walk the plank and proceeds to have every single one of its characters tell you outright who they are, what they want and what their skills are. “I’ve been studying all known curses for years,” Henry Turner tells his captain before committing mutiny 10 seconds later. No sooner is he thrown in the brig than a cellmate picks up a conveniently placed poster of Jack Sparrow and tells Henry that Sparrow has been buried in an unmarked grave. Thanks for the useless info that has zero bearing on the story, random stranger.</p>\n<p>This continual spoon-feeding of information never lets up for the rest of the movie. For instance, the not-at-all-intimidating, impossible to understand and interesting-as-dirt villain Captain Salazar narrates an extended flashback scene about how he was outwitted by Jack Sparrow. As it concludes with showing us when Salazar was cursed and imprisoned in the Devil’s Triangle, there is nary an explanation as to how or why, other than, “Oh, it’s called the Devil’s Triangle. So it’s cursed.”</p>\n<p>“Dead Men Tell No Tales” thinks you are very, very stupid. It believes you are not capable of deducing why characters might want to accomplish their goals. And when they are accomplishing those goals, the characters will go out and say, “We are accomplishing our goals!” just in case you didn’t already get it, you moron.</p>\n<p>Which, by the way, is exactly what Jack has been reduced to. All the cunning and guile he once had is replaced with a bumbling, drunken, abject idiocy and selfishness that makes him more annoying than likable. Jack has no goal in the movie, nothing to reach for. He is just getting dragged along for the ride, much as we are. The only time I felt any connection with him was when I shared his confusion when he woke up to discover that he was being married off to a horrendously disgusting woman that the movie wants you to know is horrendously disgusting so much because it doesn’t believe that you’ll figure out that Jack finds her horrendously disgusting. Where the hell did this scene come from and how exactly is it significant? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Barbossa receives the same treatment. A once-threatening villain has been thoroughly declawed, all for the sake of the movie delivering even more exposition to tell us that he had a past romance, which does not mesh well with the way he has acted in the past films. Salazar is unable to fill in the void that has been left behind, as he sounds too goofy and looks too artificial to have any menace. He falls far short when compared to the Barbossa of yore and the tragic Davy Jones. We are left with a villain who comes across as even more cartoony than the abundant CGI scenery.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78258\" style=\"width: 1279px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1826120927\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78257\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78258\" data-attachment-id=\"78258\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/dead-men-could-have-told-a-better-tale-than-this/pirates-of-the-caribbean/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=1269%2C887&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1269,887\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"pirates of the caribbean\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=888%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78258\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=888%2C621\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?w=1269&amp;ssl=1 1269w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=768%2C537&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=1024%2C716&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78258\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Syko News</p></div>\n<p>While we are on the subject of mismanaged characters, Orlando Bloom is completely wasted as Will Turner. All he is there for is to serve as a bookend for the movie and a goal for Henry to strive for. Considering the excited whispers I heard during the Thursday night premiere, I have no qualms about calling him fan-service either (although he comes nowhere close to being so than another actress who will go unnamed for spoiler’s sake).</p>\n<p>Kaya Scodelario as Carina is as close as the movie gets to having a fun, likeable lead. Her silly romance with Henry aside, she is confident and resourceful, easily able to hold her own against the rest of the crude pirates she comes across. So it’s a shame she’s used as a plot device to further Barbossa’s character, because she was doing so fine on her own until then.</p>\n<p>All these characters and plot threads eventually coalesce in a climax that ultimately just comes across as far too convenient for its own good. It doesn’t even matter anyway because the film already peaked with its first silly but fun chase scene back in act one. But you probably won’t even realize this, because at this point the movie has crammed so many special effects, bright lights and poorly lit, seizure-inducing action scenes that your already-dulled brain will be fried to a crisp.</p>\n<p>Who wrote this thing?

Season 1 Episode 2, “Parents,” hit home for many first-generation American viewers, including myself, as protagonist Dev Shah, played by Aziz Ansari, explores the history of his parent’s experiences as immigrants in the United States. Season 1 of “Master of None” received much praise for the fresh storytelling and day-to-day humor of Dev’s life as he finds love and navigates through his 30s in New York. To my own and others’ rejoice, Ansari reprised his role as Dev in Season 2 of “Master of None.” The long-awaited second season once again wowed viewers with new expositions, social commentary, a killer soundtrack and “Atlanta” style casual humor.</p>\n<p>In Ansari’s own version of “Under the Tuscan Sun,” the season begins with Dev living in Italy and learning the ways of pasta-making after breaking up with his love interest from Season 1. The cinematography almost identically follows the classic black-and-white Italian film “The Bike Thief.” Dev anxiously searches Modena, Italy, in an attempt to find the person who stole his phone, with even more pressure to retrieve the newly acquired number of a beautiful British girl he met that day. The stupendously pleasing black-and-white scenes nicely blend with the predominantly Italian-spoken episode, a language which Ansari actually learned how to speak proficiently while researching the script for Season 2. Something noteworthy about the show is how Dev’s character strays far from the typical Indian TV-show archetype. Throughout television history, countless minority men, especially those with Asian backgrounds, have been desexualized and portrayed as weak, awkward individuals, or they’re solely in background roles such as corner store clerks, as seen in the show “Big Bang Theory,” for example.</p>\n<p>False representations of Asian men in media has led to many real life repercussions and the development of negative stereotypes. It’s extremely refreshing to see a show in which minority characters break away from stereotypical archetypes and thrive in roles not traditional to their ethnicities.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from breaking typical minority archetypes, “Master of None” oh-so-beautifully plays on cultural traditions and experiences. The episode “Religion” examines Dev’s experiences as a Muslim-American as he balances both cultures with his preferences and that of his parents. For Dev, it’s his taste for pork and other non-Islamic habits that conflicts with his mother’s wishes for him to strictly follow Islam, or at least act like he does among extended family. Viewers from any religion or background can share Dev’s experience of what it feels like to diverge from your parents’ idealized expectations  and dealing with the fallout of having them face that reality. Nonetheless, Dev comes to terms with his mother’s wishes. Although he may not be who she wanted him to be, he still mostly respects his mother’s traditions and beliefs in her presence.</p>\n<p>Aside from following the life of Dev and his journey for love, “Master of None” does an incredible job at seamlessly including narratives about unconventional characters. The “Thanksgiving” episode follows the coming-out experience of Dev’s longtime friend Denise over a series of hilarious Thanksgiving dinners that are embodied with the music and style of the year during which they take place. The episode highlights pivotal moments in Denise’s coming-of-age story, from the start of Denise’s rebellion against her mother’s proposed frilly dresses to the moment her mother comes to accept Denise’s sexuality and welcomes Denise’s girlfriend. The show does an excellent job at highlighting the experience of Denise’s progression with her sexuality as well as the pressure that Denise faces when coming out as a queer woman of color. Her mother is especially troubled by the fact that Denise’s life will become harder as a queer woman of color, perhaps more so than if she were just a lesbian. The episode is full of nostalgic and humorous family anecdotes, my favorite being Denise’s mother’s explanation of what a minority is to young Dev and Denise after Denise finds out Dev is Indian and not black.</p>\n<p>Another favorite episode plays out like what you would expect an episode of “Humans of New York” would be like. All intertwined through a series of random encounters, the episode puts a spotlight on the life of different individuals of different socioeconomic, racial and handicapped groups. From a deaf couple signing their intimacy issues in a mute but hilariously played out conversation to doormen who witness and deal with all the drama that unfolds among the buildings tenants, the episode finishes with a couple of Rwandan taxi drivers just trying to look for a wild night out in the city. Ansari and other writers do an outstanding job of showing the lives of background and typically sidelined characters, the real humans of New York: the working class, non-glamorized New Yorkers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78255\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1558006261\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78255\" data-attachment-id=\"78255\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/drink2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=440%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"440,913\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"drink2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=120%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=440%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78255\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?resize=440%2C913\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"913\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?resize=120%2C250&amp;ssl=1 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78255\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Like cookie without milk or peanut butter without jelly, the show without its perfect soundtrack would leave something missing for viewers. “Master of None” understands how most modern-day viewers consume music; we fit it with our mood, with the moment and where we are. Similar to how we all have that friend who knows what song will perfectly fit the moment, “Master of None” is that friend. In “Thanksgiving,” the music is what sets the ‘90s setting, with “Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like That)” in the intro to submerge viewers into the nostalgia of ‘90s rap jazz beats. Dev’s moment of childhood rebellion when he takes a bite of bacon despite his mother’s orders is righteously accompanied by Tupac’s “Only God Can Judge Me.” That moment of perilous contemplation that we have all experienced, when Dev sits in the back of an Uber thinking about the dreadful reality that he’s in love with an engaged woman, is melancholically paired with “Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.” With music being the final piece in the puzzle, Ansari develops a show that is simply real.</p>\n<p>As the quarter comes to an end and finals approach, cramming goes into full force and the library is filled to the brim. It’s important to remember that the most effective way to retain information is with 45 to 50-minute study intervals and 15-minute breaks. If you don’t wish to lose your table in those 15 minutes, consider watching half an episode of “Master of None.” Allow yourself to fall in love with the Italian countryside, the lives of average New Yorkers or a witty and lovable Dev Shah. The show does everything it aims to so well, and yet it doesn’t focus on just one thing. It reflects on growing up, love, music and family, but it also doubles as a comedy and drama. This show is truly a jack of all trades, but not a master of none.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/","id":5783,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[5782,5781,5780],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Actress of ‘Tangerine’ Brings New Perspective to Trans Media","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"So, should “Tangerine” be only recognized for shooting on an iPhone 5S? Hell no.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday, May 25, Pollock Theater’s Trans Media series program screened “Tangerine,” the movie most widely known for being shot on an iPhone 5S. It’s Christmas Eve, and Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) has just been released from prison only to find out that her boyfriend, Chester (James Ransone), left her for another girl. To find out the truth about this rumor, Sin-Dee and her friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) journey through the diverse areas of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The film feels very authentic with the way in which it captures Los Angeles. The use of the iPhone 5S helps show the setting in a more down-to-earth manner. Everything appears as if it were captured in the moment, instead of being modified to look more perfect in post-production. The unrestricted nature of using a smartphone instead of a large camera benefitted the production of this film, as there were shots that would not be done in a traditional filmmaking set because sound or lighting equipment would interfere with the reflection or flow of a shot.</p>\n<p>The acting is another factor of the film that made it such a realistic experience. Most of the people involved in the film were not big names, but the possibility that they actually live in Los Angeles made their performances feel more genuine than if it were to be done by any Hollywood actor. Most of the supporting cast are the various people Sin-Dee and Alexandra meet during their odyssey across Los Angeles. They all play some part in reflecting the general themes of friendship and connectedness in the film. The performances don’t even feel like actors reading lines; they feel like normal people causally living their lives which are captured by director Sean Baker’s crew.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While Rodriguez was excellent in her role as Sin-Dee, Taylor stole every scene she was in as Alexandra, which is what made me highly anticipate the Q&amp;A session that was held after the screening between Taylor and Patrice Petro, director of Carsey-Wolf Center and Film and Media Studies Department professor.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained how she got the role through Baker, who approached her while she was talking with a friend outside the Los Angeles LGBT Center because he wanted to draw real-life experiences for the film.

The purpose of UCSB’s Trans Media program is to “showcase contemporary media work in television, narrative filmmaking, and critical documentary in an effort to explore the relationship between sexual orientation and gender identity outside of a rigid binary view of the world,” according to the Carsey-Wolf Center website.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained to Petro that she felt like an advocate for trans women. Taylor illustrated this notion by recounting her personal life. She was rejected by jobs because her I.D. stated that she was still a man even though she considered herself  transgender. She explained how random strangers she met were much more accepting than her own family members. She wanted to live a normal life, and even though “Tangerine” gave her that opportunity, she still thought of those who didn’t have the same chance as she did. She explained how some people could get rejected so many times that they could resort to drugs; it was all a domino effect. She didn’t want to be selfish about her success and wanted to help others instead. With the money involved in her job, she noticed how she was moving up the ranks, and she looked to the people still on the streets. She noted how it was difficult to get out of this kind of situation, so she wanted to open up to that community more.</p>\n<p>However, even as an actress, she still faced being stereotyped by Hollywood. When Taylor was first doing auditions, her manager offered roles of a victim. These roles were associated with Taylor either playing a prostitute or someone who was killed in the film. As she went to more colleges and found more LGBT students, she realized that an entire community of people were viewed in one restricted way. Fortunately, Taylor began to work under a new manager, who got her into roles for the short films “Diane from the Moon” and “Happy Birthday, Marsha!”</p>\n<p>So, should “Tangerine” be only recognized for shooting on an iPhone 5S? Hell no. While the film itself was completely different from other films I have seen, it was the context surrounding this movie explained through Taylor’s Q&amp;A session that made the film feel much more unique and important.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/","id":5782,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5781,5780,5779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beloved Cartoon ‘Samurai Jack’ Comes and Goes","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The show made its long-awaited return in March.

Although it had been 14 years for us, for Jack himself, it had been 50. During that time, the wandering samurai went through several traumatic events that left him without his sword, his optimism and his humanity. This change of tone allowed creator Genndy Tartakovsky to forego the original show’s episodic format in favor of a serialized journey.</p>\n<p>As a result, we got an emotionally harrowing tale of a worn-down Jack, who has by now gone full Mad Max, riding a motorcycle and shooting guns. He fights his suicidal guilt over not only failing to return to the past to save his family, but also failing to save those who have fallen victim to the rule of Aku (now voiced by Greg Baldwin). Meanwhile, Jack must confront and face newcomer Ashi (Tara Strong, a.k.a. Timmy Turner), a woman with a traumatic past who is more than capable of kicking Jack’s ass. Together, they endure many misadventures that allow us to ease back into the wonderfully weird world of our favorite time-displaced samurai.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notably, the switch from plain old Cartoon Network to the Adult Swim time slot allowed the show to be grittier, bloodier, more emotionally wrenching and gave us the line, “Woah, what a freak. Looked like a talking penis,” from Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob Squarepants).</p>\n<p>This change in tone is welcome, as everyone who watched “Jack” as a child (myself included) have all grown up. While I wouldn’t say we were hungry for guts and gore (which this season has used sparingly), we certainly came to expect something more engrossing that would justify the series’s 13-year absence. We got it.</p>\n<p>Holy shit did we. But the show’s return is also indicative of a current trend in the television landscape: the appeal to nostalgia.</p>\n<p>No-brainer, right? If it was popular once, why not bring it back (cough someone renew “Firefly” dammit cough)?  We’re seeing the likes of “Twin Peaks,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Voltron,” “24,” “Arrested Development,” “Ben 10,” “Dragon Ball Super,” “Young Justice,” et cetera, et cetera, coming back from the grave (or at least from the line at the morgue). All of these shows are either revivals or sequels of a once-popular franchise that has been kept alive via an intravenous stream of fan demand. The market for nostalgia is exploding.</p>\n<p>You can see this pretty clear within season five of “Jack” itself.  Although technology has marched on (everything is animated digitally), the show’s visual style has stayed almost exactly the same, despite Taratovsky having experimented with other styles and formats. There’s an episode where Ashi runs into a whole plethora of characters from the original run of “Samurai Jack.” The re-animated flashback scenes are staged almost exactly like the original versions, setting up the viewer for an emotional reminiscence before eventually getting back to the action at hand.</p>\n<p>Basically, TV shows have discovered that the best way to rein us in is tossing a barbed lasso around our hearts and memories. As cheesy and stupid a metaphor as that sounds (you can see why I am not a poet), it sure as hell works. The last two “Star Wars” movies made more than a billion dollars at the box office. So did “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s even a “live-action” “The Lion King” coming up and I will bet my firstborn — whenever they come into existence — that it will make just as much money as the aforementioned films.</p>\n<p>Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. We get to see the stories of stuff we love re-imagined and the people who took the effort of others and gave it a new coat of paint get a shitload of money … hm.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s look at it another way. These continuations of our childhoods allow us, I believe, to stop and reflect for a moment on how we’ve grown. We can see how culture has aged with us; we get to reflect on why we fell in love with these shows in the first place. Or maybe we’re just children in the bodies of college students. If so, I’d like to propose a resolution to A.S. that we place a giant ball pit in front of Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, where was I? Ah, right. This Saturday, “Samurai Jack” will end. How? Who knows? But after so many years, many of us will gain closure. We will get to see a journey we’ve been watching since 2001 finally come to an end, along with a chapter of our childhoods. There better be gallons of blood all over the screen.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung clearly has no idea what the hell he is talking about and it’s a wonder we haven’t fired him yet.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/","id":5807,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5806,5805,5804],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"route":"/categories/artsweek/film-and-tv","highestPage":15}},"__N_SSG":true}
