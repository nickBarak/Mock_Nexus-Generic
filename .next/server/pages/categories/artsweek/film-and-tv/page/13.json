A virtuoso is defined as “a person highly skilled with special knowledge in various artistic pursuits” and this year’s crew had no shortage of special talents. The honorees included Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”), Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”), J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”), Logan Lerman (“Fury”), David Oyelowo (“Selma”), Chadwick Boseman (“Get on Up”) and Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> was exclusively among the journalistic press on the red carpet and spoke to every honoree before they received their grand award.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Growing up, did you have similar experiences as your character, Mason in “Boyhood?”</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, I mean a lot of them, more and less. I was homeschooled so what I was doing was kind of different, but emotionally and psychological, definitely. I was always kind of right there with Mason … that was an incredible outlet to have, everything I went through, and you’re trying to figure out so much, especially as a teenager, and [I was] able to take those things in fiction and look at them somewhat subjectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What do you remember when you were six years old auditioning for this film?</p>\n<p>A: I remembered it was a long audition process and Richard didn’t have the script written or anything. So it wasn’t like most auditions where you go and read lines. It’s just kind of an understanding, he was trying to get to know me … I brought in art and he talked to my parents and it was very casual.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara. What is your impression of the SB so far?</p>\n<p>A: I had a great time so far. I came up early yesterday morning, we spent a day on beach, had a picnic [and I] went to La Supa Rica last night with my partner. My two sons [are] here, so we’ve just been building sand castles and playing in the waves; it’s wonderful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: This role is such a revolutionary role for women in Hollywood. How does it feel to be chosen to play such a complex character?</p>\n<p>A: It’s just a film about women empowerment, with a bit of murder thrown in for good measure. But take out the murder and a lot of it is about women empowerment. She is sort of an unusual woman who in different circumstances could have been [a] genuinely exceptional human being. It’s just that she has this sort of misplaced sense of entitlement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I think the point is she is not a monster. She is just sort of [a monster], for the sake of a screenwriter having fun writing this villainous character. [But] she’s totally grounded in reality; I know exactly where she comes from. It’s just the extreme we’re not used to seeing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to shoot these scenes over and over again? I know David Fincher and he’s a perfectionist.</p>\n<p>A: Well I am [a perfectionist] too, so we had a meeting in mind on the part. I never mind[ed] how many times I had to do it; I’d rather get it right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like filming that particular scene with Neil Patrick Harris?</p>\n<p>A: That’s the nature of David Fincher filming: his foresight, his planning was like a military operation. We’d do one scene and it [would] be a blood bath, the sides of the set would go up, and the bed would be wheeled out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How many showers did you take for the scene?</p>\n<p>A: 47 or something.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’re such a champion for English designers. Will we be seeing some more English designers for future red carpets, especially at the Oscars?</p>\n<p>A: I’m not going to give anything away but in the near future you will see some English designers coming soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What did you see in this role of Fletcher that first drew you in?</p>\n<p>A: Everything that an actor is looking for in a part is telling a compelling story, and [playing] a character that I can really sink my teeth into.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Playing an evil character is much more fun…</p>\n<p>A: It can be. But I’m glad I don’t play it all the time because it’s nice to go back and forth and play different types of guys.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Was it fun to slap your co-star Miles Teller repeatedly?</p>\n<p>A: It’s great fun to slap Miles Teller, it’s beautiful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s it like to play different characters and not being put in a box?</p>\n<p>A: That’s always the goal; good writing is always a joy to do. Bad writing is hard to act and when you get boxed in doing a stereotypical character, those could be long days in the office.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How does it feel to be nominated for an Oscar from a film that was made in only 20 days?</p>\n<p>A: 19 actually. We’re sort of the little movie that could and for the film to be nominated as a Best Picture nominee, Damien to be nominated and Tom, our sound guy [is incredible].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Damien is only thirty years old, which is pretty young…</p>\n<p>A: He was twenty-six when I first met him, [that’s] when his journey started.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Logan Lerman (“Fury”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: The magnitude of this film — what was it like to work with all these amazing actors?</p>\n<p>A: I felt really lucky to be in good company and they pushed me to play as I’ve ever been before.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did they teach you anything during the process?</p>\n<p>A: They taught me a lot about myself, my personal limits, what it’s like to break those limits and what happens on camera and in scenes. I learned a lot from them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Were there any pranks going on during the filming?</p>\n<p>A: No, it was a pretty serious set. But it was a great experience, it really was.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Should fans anticipate another Percy Jackson?</p>\n<p>A: Not that I’m aware of. I know the fans would really like it and I really want another one. They’re fun films, they are really fun to make, but I haven’t heard anything about that, so I don’t know. I think we all are getting a little old to play those characters, so I wouldn’t hold my breath necessarily.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>David Oyelowo (“Selma”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara, how does it feel to be here?</p>\n<p>A: I love Santa Barbara; I always have a good time every time I come here. It’s nice to come here and get an award.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to prepare for this role, such an iconic character?</p>\n<p>A: It was challenging but it was also incredibly rewarding. The most rewarding thing is to see people respond so beautifully to the film.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I know you recently marched with Oprah this past MLK Day in Selma. How did it feel to march down the town’s incredible history?</p>\n<p>A: It was a full circle for us because Selma still has a lot of problems. [It’s] economically deprived [and] there is still segregation down there, not officially, but practically speaking there is. Hopefully the film brings attention to the community in a way that helps it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman (“Get on Up”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like being a playwright in New York and now getting to play all these iconic characters?</p>\n<p>A: It was two different worlds. As a playwright, it’s just you and your typewriter, it’s you and your character in a room and that it is one of the most exhilarating things you can have when you have a story that is being told to you by your own character. It rivals any moment you can have onstage, moments you can have onscreen when a story is coming through. It’s as exhilarating as being in front of the camera.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I hope that you do come back to theater.</p>\n<p>A: Who says I left theater. Maybe I’ll go to New York and train with a teacher, do some workshops. All that [can] happen, you just haven’t seen it.</p>\n<p>Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How do you feel when people categorize your film as an “abortion romcom?”</p>\n<p>A: Well you are the only person that has said that to me. I would say that when you see the movie, you’ll see that it is a story about one woman in our world right now. [She’s] making appropriate decisions for herself, and finding joy in that, and finding the complexities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I understand maybe why the media would call it an abortion comedy because it seems like a buzzy phrase. [The phrase] doesn’t mean much to me. As you can see from the work we did, our film is beautiful and complex.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/","id":6068,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6067,6066,6065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jennifer Aniston Sells Out the Arlington to Fans  “Cake” Star Receives Montecito Award","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The street facing the Arlington Theatre in Downtown Santa Barbara was completely blocked off to cars while staff anxiously scurried to make sure everything was in place.

A mass of reporters and photographers began to pool behind a low iron gate. On the opposite end, frenzied crowds gathered. Between them, a lifeless red carpet connected the street to the theater doors. The reason for the chaos on Friday, Jan. 30 was written in lights on the marquee: Jennifer Aniston, the recipient of this year’s Montecito Award, given by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF).</p>\n<p>The awaited actress finally pulled up in a black SUV at around 7:40 p.m. She was immediately met with the fans’ screams and a surge of white papers shoved over the iron barrier. Upon arrival, Aniston’s fiancé, Justin Theroux, swiftly made his way across the carpet and silently retreated in the theater, leaving unnoticed. This was his way of being careful not to detract from his fiancée’s night. Being the seasoned and diplomatic Hollywood actress that she is, Aniston was sure to attend to the fans first. After quelling their screams, she began making her way down the press line, pausing periodically for questions and pictures, as over-exuberant fans belted the “Friends” theme song in an attempt to win back her attention.</p>\n<p>The primary reason for the 45-year old actress’s presence at SBIFF was her recent performance in Daniel Barnz’s dark independent drama, “Cake.” With its issues of chronic pain and addiction, “Cake” doesn’t quite fit the actress’s repertoire of lighter romantic comedies, or even her more emotional films such as “Marley &amp; Me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I asked the New York native what her least favorite part of filming the atypical role of Claire was, to which she carefully responded, “Stopping it! I really had so much fun, as difficult as the role was. It was quite a lovely set and we had a beautiful, fun creative experience together. Everyone was sort of getting out of their real selves and taking a risk, and everyone was really supportive each of each other and it was…” her voice trailed off, before she dreamily sighed, “I was in heaven, so I was sad when it was over.”</p>\n<p>The actress of over 25 years was not nominated for the exclusive Montecito Award, but rather chosen. Although the foremost reason for this award is her role in “Cake<em>,</em>” it dually honors the countless other performances that have paved her successful career.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8 o’clock the hoard of ticketholders for the night’s event flooded the theatre, as Aniston sat down for an extensive interview accompanied by various clips of her past performances. The talk completely sold out the Arlington’s 2,000 seats, a rare feat. Her entire acting career was spanned, beginning with her years spent at a “Fame”-style performing arts high school in New York. After years of determination, double shifts and failed pilots (“Ferris Bueller” TV series anyone?), a fateful summer in L.A. finally led Aniston to her role as Rachel on the iconic “Friends.” A star was born.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston quickly became a major household name in the 90s and has continued as one into present times. Even then, she makes it a point to mention that it’s still hard for her at times to land specific roles she wants. This is partly due to the baggage that comes with being a world-famous actress conflicting with the desired obscurity of smaller films. There’s also the tragic tendency for artists to be pigeonholed into one role. Still, she enjoys the challenge of consistently proving herself, stating she “had to lobby” for the chance to play Claire in “Cake.”</p>\n<p>Watching the numerous filmstrips from the theatre’s balcony, it is hard to deny the often-overlooked variety of Aniston’s roles and the specific talent delivered in each one. Her equal love for making big budget as well as independent films is clear with the juxtaposition of films like “Horrible Bosses” and “He’s Just Not That Into You” with “Office Space” and “Friends With Money.”</p>\n<p>Going against the famous “one for them, one for me” rule commonly cited by big-name actors, Aniston discussed the different types of fulfillment she receives from routinely dipping into both ends of the cinematic spectrum. Throughout the event, it was obvious that she genuinely feeds off of the artistic pleasure she gets from acting. After receiving the award, Jennifer Aniston abandoned her pre-written speech and spoke from the heart. Tears streamed down her face as a physical artifact embodying raw gratitude.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/","id":6044,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6043,6042,6041],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award “Theory of Everything” Stars Speak to the Nexus on the Red Carpet","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Eddie Redmayne has been on a roll lately.

Nominated for over 25 awards for his leading role as Stephen Hawking in the biographical film “The Theory of Everything,” the 33-year-old British actor has already won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors’ Guild Awards for Best Actor in a drama. He’s a strong contender for a BAFTA and an Academy Award.</p>\n<p>Felicity Jones, 31, who played Stephen Hawking’s wife, Jane Wilde Hawking, was also nominated for many awards, including all listed above. But last Thursday, Jan. 29 at the Arlington Theatre, both leads were recognized with the Cinema Vanguard Award. The SBIFF tribute celebrated their outstanding careers, particularly their acclaimed performances in “The Theory of Everything.”</p>\n<p>The night began with a red carpet event featuring Redmayne and Jones accompanied by Anthony McCarten, screenwriter of the film. The stars met and greeted fans before walking along the line of reporters, starting with the television journalists and moving down. I waited patiently toward the end of the line, and although Redmayne ran out of time, I did get the opportunity to ask Jones one question: How did she feel about playing such an important role in giving Jane the credit she deserves for the impact she had on Stephen’s life an achievements?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“That’s the whole reason I’m here, because of that woman,” Jones said. “[Jane], in many ways, was a bit of an invisible woman, and it’s been an absolute honor, and very important, to bring her story to light. That has always been the main focus for all of us, in making the film, to shed light on this phenomenal woman.”</p>\n<p>After the meetings with reporters, and when the photographers finished taking all the red carpet snaps they needed, the procession moved inside the theater for the main event. Roger Durling, executive director of the film festival, gave a short speech and introduced Scott Feinberg, writer for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, who moderated the evening. The Q&amp;A was interspersed with three clips from “The Theory of Everything” as well as clips from past films starring the actors including “Savage Grace,” “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables” for Redmayne, and “The Tempest,” “Like Crazy” and “The Invisible Woman” for Jones.</p>\n<p>Feinberg asked them many questions, starting with if they knew each other before the film. The two had met before, having auditioned for a few of the same films, none of which either of them earned, they joked.</p>\n<p>Meeting Stephen and Jane Wilde Hawking was an honor for the pair, and they described how nervous they would get whenever one of the Hawkings visited the set during production. They also talked about the difficulties of portraying the different stages of Stephen’s ALS, which included Jones acting out the changing methods Jane would use as his disease progressed. This was especially difficult considering that scenes, for budget reasons, are not filmed in chronological order. Luckily, both Stephen and Jane loved the actors’ performances, saying it was like watching themselves.</p>\n<p>Drawing away from “Theory,” the two elaborated on their earlier work. Redmayne described his incredibly awkward but amusing experiences playing Julianne Moore’s son in “Savage Grace<em>,</em>” which is about an incestuous mother-son relationship. While filming “My Week with Marilyn<em>,</em>” he remembered how insensitive he sometimes was about how difficult it was for Michelle Williams to play an icon like Marilyn Monroe. The insensitivity came back to haunt him during his trial and tribulations while acting as Stephen.</p>\n<p>Jones also discussed the interesting experience she had filming “Like Crazy.” The film did not have a formal script, just a very detailed story outline around which the actors improvised all of their dialogue. She said this was a difficult but rewarding experience, and did improvisation again with the same director in “Breathe In.”</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A ended with Feinberg introducing screenwriter McCarten to the stage to present the Cinema Vanguard Award. His moving and funny speech praised the stars for their talent, wit and most of all, their young age. “Their combined age is 35,” he joked. He also thanked them for their extraordinary performances that brought his screenplay to life and gave them their award, ending the beautiful night in downtown Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/","id":6064,"author":{"id":758,"name":"Arasch Blurfrushan"},"related":[6063,6062,6061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Emotions Spring Up During Michael Keaton’s Tribute","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Michael Keaton is well-loved.

A man who has done genres from salacious comedy to psycho-thriller, he’s scored admiration from co-stars and directors alike in his career, which began in 1968 when he operated “Picture, Picture” for Mister Rogers. But the fact that Keaton is well-loved was perhaps never as overwhelmingly apparent as it was last Saturday, Jan. 31 during his Maltin Modern Master tribute ceremony for his work in “Birdman.” Between Jeff Bridges’ video message, Danny Devito’s surprise entrance and SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling’s tearful speech, the love was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It started off with a speech from ­­­film critic Leonard Maltin, who moderated the evening. Instead of the proverbial praising of Keaton for all that he has done, Maltin opted for a flashback. “I remember sitting in the theater in Manhattan on Broadway with my wife in 1982 … and watching a movie called ‘Night Shift,’” he said. “Onto the screen burst this extraordinary comedic performer.”</p>\n<p>Maltin continued by focusing not on the Birdman-Batman dichotomy that so many film critics have fallen for, but instead insisting that “Birdman is just a reaffirmation of Michael Keaton’s enormous talent.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Birdman as a reaffirmation of his talent” was a theme that continued throughout the night, a direct response to all the press Keaton is getting for his absence in Hollywood. “Birdman” stars Keaton as a washed-up actor famous for being a superhero, who attempts to restore his craft through theater. So it’s pretty easy to compare Keaton’s own life to that of his character — actor famous for being a superhero disappears until this movie. Perhaps Keaton’s personal life was part of director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s impetus for placing him as Riggan Thomson.</p>\n<p>More likely though is that Keaton’s reputation as a versatile actor contributed to him getting this role, one that has landed him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as a contender for the Oscar. Whatever the reason, the fact that Keaton is a man of many roles was spelled out time and time again during his tribute at the Arlington.</p>\n<p>“Hi Michael, it’s your old friend Noni … I think this [award is] kind of great because it is for your body of work,” said Winona Ryder, in her video message that kicked off “Beetlejuice” clips. She stood in the snow at Sundance, clearly freezing in a hooded coat as she voiced her excitement for Keaton. “The thing about you is that I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people cannot decide what their favorite Michael Keaton movie is … because you create such extraordinary characters.”</p>\n<p>Judging from his expressiveness when talking about his career, it seemed like one of Keaton’s favorites to work on was definitely “Beetlejuice.” The actor lit up while talking about Tim Burton. “Tim. He’s unique,” he said, as the crowd laughed. “It’s not a word you can apply to many people … He had this thing, but he couldn’t quite [describe it yet]. He wasn’t there yet.” Keaton mentioned that he almost didn’t do the movie because the visionary eccentric Burton wasn’t describing anything he could understand.</p>\n<p>But a great thing about working with Burton [apart from directors like, say, Tarantino] was that he did not monopolize his directing status, and allowed Keaton to be part of the creative process. “[Tim told me that] maybe [Betelgeuse] lives under rocks — so I got the idea of mold. That’s where the mold came from.”</p>\n<p>In 1989, Keaton got to work with Burton again for “Batman” and he developed the rough voice that the superhero became so iconic for. He was, in fact, the very first Batman that gave Bruce Wayne a different voice in the suit.</p>\n<p>“I’d move from Bruce Wayne to Batman, [and thought] he had to transcend. I worked out this whole bullshit actor-y thing. I thought, ‘I gotta have something that makes me believe I don’t walk out on the street in this big rubbery suit and people think — hey Bruce Wayne is out again.’ So I did the voice. And we just used it. Every time I was Batman I altered my voice.”</p>\n<p>That bullshit actor-y thing became the basis for Keaton’s Birdman voice. “[For “Birdman”], the voice got crazier, with more incarnations of it. And then it grew from that.”</p>\n<p>The voice is just one of the aesthetic elements of “Birdman,” a drums-steered movie where the camera never stops rolling. “It was a risky gig, for all of us. But what are we here for? We are here for a millisecond,” said Keaton. “For me courage is the ultimate. That’s it. You gotta have guts.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton’s guts were displayed well and true in “Birdman,” but the thing that made this particular evening so special was the enormous affection showered onto him by colleagues. And no video message, not even Robert Duval or Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s, could top the emotion of SBIFF Artistic Director Roger Durling.</p>\n<p>“In 2001, Michael would show up to a coffee shop in Summerland and order a double nonfat latte from a barista,” he began. “[He’d] show up on Sundays to my little café to talk to me about movies … On the red carpet when you just drove in on your limo, you turned to people and said ‘Where is mi amigo Roger’ and it just so shows who you are,” Durling’s voice started cracking.</p>\n<p>“[You’re] not just one of the greatest actors working today, but you’re full of integrity. You are such a real man, an hombre. I feel crystallized that the 12 years I’ve been working at the film festival, it was all meant for me to be able to honor you tonight. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton is well-loved. Yes, indeed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/","id":6036,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6035,6034,6033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF: “Desert Dancer” Premieres on Opening Night Plus Exclusive Interviews with Star Reece Ritchie and Director Richard Raymond","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Even though Santa Barbara is mostly famous for its beaches and natural landscapes, every year at the end of January the coastal city becomes the place to be for filmmakers and movie lovers.

The Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) is a 12-day celebration of all things cinema. Folks from all around the world travel here to catch the latest premieres and mingle with the hottest celebrities. Notable names this year include Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell. On Jan. 28, SBIFF welcomed its 30th anniversary with the opening premiere of the film “Desert Dancer.”</p>\n<p>Starring “Slumdog Millionaire’s” Freida Pinto, “Downtown Abbey’s” Tom Cullen and “Prince of Persia’s” Reece Ritchie, “Desert Dancer” tells the real-life story of young male dancer named Afshin Ghaffarian , who was born in Iran, a country where dancing is forbidden. Growing to love dancing, Afshin (Ritchie) is taught to resist his artistic abilities at a very young age.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at college, he is quick to discover a group of friends who encourage him to free himself. Having no dance background, Afshin teaches himself the moves through the only safe option he could find, YouTube. After watching countless instructional dancing videos, Afshin teaches his group of friends the basics of modern dance. The group begins rehearsing in secrecy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Then enters Elaheh (Pinto), a beautiful yet troubled classically trained young dancer who becomes Afshin’s ultimate dancer partner. Together, Afshin and Elaheh begin an emotional love story revolving around their passion for dance. Set amidst political turmoil of Iran’s 2009 presidential election, the dancers endure pain, love and separation while continuing to perform their greatest joy.</p>\n<p>However, as Afshin becomes increasingly targeted for his desire to dance, he realizes that the only option to fulfill his dream is to flee to Paris and leave his friends behind. He is liberated from his oppressive state and finds a new home in France, where he is granted political asylum and allowed to accomplished his greatest dream: to dance in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>First-time director Richard Raymond heard of Afshin’s life story in the most unusual way. “I had read it in a newspaper<em>, The Sunday’s Times</em>, a story about a young man Afshin Ghaffarian who wanted to become a dancer. But in Iran, dance was forbidden,” said Raymond in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> on the red carpet. “I couldn’t believe it, I was shocked — I couldn’t believe that something as innocent as dancing could be forbidden.” The young director explained the underlying message of his film, saying, “I believe that art can free anyone from oppression.”</p>\n<p>As the story spread about Afshin, Raymond’s independent film was financed by people who believed in its strong message. “The whole concept of freedom and speech, freedom of expression, it’s very important to have that,” said executive producer Mohammed Al Turki. “It was incredible that this film was only made with four million dollars.” Considering “Desert Dancer’s” star-studded cast and expensive location spots in Morrocco, London and Paris, the film made the most of its menial budget.</p>\n<p>Leading stars Pinto and Ritchie took drastic measures to prepare for their roles. To portray the elegance of a classical dancer, Pinto took rigorous dance training for a year. “The physical challenge was really difficult — blisters, pain, it was really hard,” said Ritchie. “Dancing on sand is nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p>But things started to look up for Ritchie when he re-evaluated his role as Afshin. “You suddenly realize that it’s about the impulse that this person is trying to express, rather than the technical brilliance of the dance,” said Ritchie. “I love that it was different, it was a story about freedom. Instead of car chases and gun fights, it was a human story, [one] that happened only four or five years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” is an emotionally-charged film with an important message: art is freedom. The story of Afshin Ghaffarian serves as a beacon of hope for any young individual who has the desire to achieve their biggest dream.</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” opens in select theaters on April 10.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/","id":6042,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6041,6040,6039],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek Picks for Santa Barbara International Film Festival","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Santa-Barbara-Film-Festival1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Santa-Barbara-Film-Festival1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  “Jean-Michel Cousteau’s Secret Ocean 3D” Phi Do, staff writer In many ocean documentaries, large creatures like dolphins, sharks and whales often dominate the frame.

But thanks to the groundbreaking filming tools of digital macro and motion macro 3D technology, viewers can now uncover a secret world underneath the waves. We’re talking about a world too small to be seen by the naked eye.</p>\n<p>Shot in the Bahamas, Fiji and Bimini, “Secret Ocean 3D” displays the interdependent relationships of marine life through octopi, Moray eels, arrow crabs and zooplankton spaceships. Over 40 species are observed in the documentary, enabling audience members to get up close and personal to underwater scenes like Squid City and Kelp Forest Avenue. With revolutionary filming techniques, director Jean-Michel Cousteau takes the world on the ultimate dive and shows how even the smallest organisms (on which the rest of the food chain depends) warrant as much protection as the dolphins and whales.</p>\n<p>“Secret Ocean 3D” will be screened downtown on Feb. 2. Jean-Michel Cousteau and his children Fabien and Celine were honored with the Attenborough Award on Jan. 28 at the Arlington Theater. Pick up the <em>Daily Nexus</em> next week for coverage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bD8gnSlZW8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones</p>\n<p>Arasch Blurfrushan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, stars of “The Theory of Everything” will be honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award in recognition of their career achievements, particularly for their acclaimed performances as Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde Hawking.</p>\n<p>Born in London on January 6, 1982, Redmayne started his performance career with the National Youth Music Theatre and made his stage debut at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in 2002. He scored his break with a minor role as Matt Damon’s son in the 2006 film “The Good Shepherd.” His rise continued with major roles in “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables.”</p>\n<p>Jones was born in Birmingham, England on October 17, 1983. The English actress’s first major role was the antagonist in the 1998 British TV series “The Worst Witch.” She went on to appear in “Doctor Who” and in a TV adaptation of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>. In 2011, Jones won the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize for “Like Crazy,” for her role opposite Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence. The actors improvised almost of all of the dialogue from a script outline.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” portrays the personal lives of the Hawkings and how instrumental Jane was in her husband’s success. Jones’s Oscar-nominated and moving performance excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle and her deep love for Stephen that allowed her to stay with him for years. A favorite for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Redmayne’s portrayal of Hawking’s intial stages of ALS was near flawless. Redmayne and Jones will be honored at the Arlington Theater tonight, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Salz7uGp72c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Confession”</p>\n<p>Alex Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Premiering in the United States at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, “Confession” is the debut feature of director Lee Do-Yoon. Nominated for three Korean Golden Bell Awards, the South Korean film is a neo-noir crime thriller that follows three friends: Hyun-tae, In-chul and Min-soo.</p>\n<p>After graduating from school, the three begin to lead separate lives. Hyun-tae and Min-soo take on calm lifestyles with standard jobs, while In-chul’s career as an insurance agent leads him to take some considerably criminal risks.

Well if you were (or secretly were), you will definitely enjoy this little film, since it is pretty much the adult, real-world version of HSM. Based on the Broadway musical with the same name, “The Last Five Years” is a romantic journey between two young individuals making their way in the city of New York. Struggling actress Cathy Hiatt, (Anna Kendrick, “Pitch Perfect”) and aspiring novelist Jamie Wellerstein (Jeremy Jordan, “Smash”) are a married couple going through the ropes of a modern 21st-century relationship.</p>\n<p>Unlike any other cliché love story, “The Last Five Years” is told in a very different way. Directed by Academy Award nominee Richard LaGravenese, the musical explores the history of the two lovers in opposite chronological order. Cathy’s point of view is told in flashback from the end of the marriage while Jamie’s version is told from the first time the pair met.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t catch spoilers in the last sentence, yes, the marriage did not last. Audiences get to enjoy the songs and music that pair with a slowly destructive relationship, while relating to the issues that every couple has to face.</p>\n<p>The main winner in this situation is the musical’s writer, Jason Robert Brown. While the Broadway musical is based on his own failed marriage to his ex-wife, it is Brown who has the final laugh as he now has written a highly successful play that has been produced internationally. So it must be true … nothing like a heartbreak to develop some real inspiration. Take that Taylor Swift! You’re not the only one making it rain by writing music about your failed relationships!</p>\n<p>“The Last Five Years” will make you laugh, cry, and sing along … maybe all at the same time. It will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 2 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dT0mrKzObw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies”</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60299\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"734258363\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60298\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60299\" data-attachment-id=\"60299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/mv5bmty1ndc4mja5mv5bml5banbnxkftztcwnji5njuwna-_v1_sx214_al_/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"214,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60299 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=214%2C325\" alt=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" width=\"214\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?w=214&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-60299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>imdb.com</em></p></div>\n<p>Follow the steady descent of Gilby Small’s life as he loses his job, his girlfriend and his apartment all in a single week. As a man in his thirties newly re-nesting with his eccentric mother, Gilby doesn’t have much going for him. But when a glimmer of hope appears on the horizon of his increasingly bleak life in the form of Rachel, his best friend’s married sister, Gilby sees no choice but to attempt to woo her … with a string of lies, of course.</p>\n<p>When he finally lies himself into a corner, Gilby realizes he must confront himself before trying to be with anybody else. Written and directed by Phil Allocco, “The Truth About Lies” puts a comically depressing yet endearing twist on the typical romantic comedy. It forces audiences to identify with Gilby, the big liar. What is the truth about lies? Maybe that we all do it to fabricate certain aspects of our lives and ourselves in an attempt to give others a wrong impression. Or maybe that lies can be occasionally well-meaning.</p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies” will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 1 and Feb. 4.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

whiskey sours while a crowd of Gauchos dance their faces off to “I don’t give a f*ck,” the latest ramble of sophistication from Big Sean to bless this college campus. No, this didn’t actually happen, but who knows what the very near future will hold — because it just so happens that Aniston, Carell and Redmayne will be hanging out on State Street, coming to claim their awards as victors in the 2015 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>SBIFF is the 12 days out of the year when State Street is inundated with movie stars and paparazzi, when the red carpet rolls out in front of the Arlington Theater and limousines arrive in hordes like freshmen at a fraternity party. Never-before-seen films debut at one of the seven theaters downtown, with categories including shorts, features, documentaries and the delectably titled “screen cuisine.”</p>\n<p>Post-screening galas are accompanied by Santa Ynez Valley wine, and directors from all over the world swap stories with each other (and lucky Artsweek reporters). Competitions abound, with films from the eastern bloc, Spanish/Latin America and social justice realms going head-to-head for the win. Writers, producers and women from all stages of film production hold panel discussions for aspiring actors and anyone who happens to walk in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2015 marks applause-worthy celebrity award ceremonies for SBIFF, with Michael Keaton (“Birdman”), Logan Lerman (“Fury”), Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”) and Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”) all in attendance.

Lin is an antisocial nerd. Yeh carries a tough-guy facade. The three teens have nothing in common until the death of fellow student Hsia Wei-chiao provides a chance encounter for the boys to meet. Though it is ruled a suicide, the boys’ nagging suspicion propels them to embark on a mission to uncover the true cause of her death.</p>\n<p>As lies are told and secrets are revealed, the Taiwanese film “Partners in Crime” exposes what it means to be a teenager: students are more than just typical high school archetypes, restlessness and loneliness dominate youthful crises. The film also delves into the impact that one-word responses from adults who don’t understand can have. In this compelling mystery thriller, director Chang Jung-chi brings to light the truths of a girl’s death and the reality of the teenage character.</p>\n<p>“Partners in Crime” will be screened on Jan. 28, Feb. 1 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FNbN6dSENA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>When you spend 12 years of your life making one film, you’re going to get some kind of award. It’s just a fact of life.</p>\n<p>Although they actually didn’t work on Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” for <em>that </em>long (just a few weeks every year), Patricia Arquette and regular Linklater-collaborator Ethan Hawke are rightfully receiving the American Riviera Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The two portray the parents of protagonist Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane). Each parent is layered and unique in their own ways. Arquette portrays Olivia Evans, a woman who manages to raise two children and become a professor despite being a single mother and enduring a slew of doomed marriages, one of which was abusive.</p>\n<p>Hawke’s turn as Mason Evans Sr. is equally powerful. He’s fun, holds strong beliefs and occasionally shows some irresponsibility, but like Olivia, his love for his children never wavers. The two actors’ portrayals are both subtle and powerful, never screaming “love me!”, but allowing the audience to see them for who they are: two people. In “Boyhood,” you don’t see Hawke and Arquette playing roles, you see Olivia and Mason Evans, separated parents who grow up just as much as their kids.</p>\n<p>For their fantastic performances, the two will be the first pair of actors to jointly receive the American Riviera Award at the Arlington Theater on State Street on Feb. 5.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0oX0xiwOv8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars”</p>\n<p>Bin Nguyen, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is a dark, fantasy-reality-themed, satirical look on the sexy, yet dangerous world of Hollywood. Starring Academy Award Nominee Julianne Moore and “Twilight” vampire Robert Pattinson, the film focuses on the turbulent, crazy life of a Hollywood actress (Moore) and her personal chauffeur (Pattinson). Her psychotic assistant, played by Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” star Mia Wasikowska, may or may not have a troubling obsession with Moore.</p>\n<p>Using Hollywood as its personal backdrop, “Maps to the Stars” entails all the elements that a good movie needs — drama, sex and suspense. Known in the horror movie genre, director David Cronenberg often incorporates themes of personal transformation in the physicality and emotional aspects of his characters. The movie appears to have all those key qualities; good characters aren’t always good and bad characters aren’t always bad.</p>\n<p>Judging from the film’s trailer, “Maps to the Stars” is a nonstop ride of events that could result in cringe-worthy moments for the audience. While one must need to see the film to appreciate its entire glory, its most notable award being Moore’s Best Actress win at the glamorous Cannes Film Festival in France. “Map to the Stars” is finally making its debut at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and Artsweek suggests you watch it to observe the nonexistence of the famous red mane on Moore’s head, if for nothing else. Yep. Iconic ginger Julianne Moore has turned blonde.</p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is showing Feb. 5-7.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIpD7V4cG9c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer </em></p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston skyrocketed to fame during her time as Rachel Green on “Friends”<em>,</em> when her great hair and bubbly personality stole the nation’s (and world’s) heart. Since then she’s managed to maintain her superstar status through great hair and playing the lead in countless romantic comedies. That isn’t to say Aniston has limited talent — her growing repertoire alone proves she’s a great actress.</p>\n<p>That being said, the seasoned star is now ready to showcase her skill in a new type of role. In Daniel Barnz’s “Cake<em>,</em>” released in late 2014, she stars alongside Anna Kendrick and William H. Macy as a dressed-down and gritty version of herself, a costume she’s never worn before. Aside from the physical difference, this film allows Aniston to portray a character dealing with emotional and physical health issues within a darker plot.</p>\n<p>“Cake” follows Aniston as she becomes obsessed with the suicide of a woman in her support group, while simultaneously dealing with her own deep conflicts. The movie promises to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey, and it will undeniably be interesting to watch the beloved actress transfer her gifts to a different type of film.</p>\n<p>Aniston will be honored with the Montecito Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Jan. 30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3IsUOSHlnU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Wet Bum”</p>\n<p>Jane Huson, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>First-time feature filmmaker Lindsay MacKay masterfully portrays the troubling teenage years of 14-year-old Sam (Julia Sarah Stone) in “Wet Bum.” Not yet physically matured into a “full woman,” Sam is mercilessly mocked for her physical attributes, or lack thereof, by her peers. Ignored and cast aside at school, Sam is forced by her mother to work at the senior assisted living home she manages. There she develops relationships with two residents in particular – Judith (Diana Leblanc), a silent woman who gives attention exclusively to Sam and Ed (Kenneth Welsh), a curmudgeon who often attempts to escape to mysterious places.</p>\n<p>As she grows closer to these disgruntled old-timers, Sam experiences hardship and enlightenment far beyond her years. “Wet Bum” features all the fears and follies you would expect from a coming-of-age story with a wise authenticity that can only be attributed to its youthful director and star. “Wet Bum” will be screened on Jan. 28-30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8Rq78ZJfMo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Steve Carell</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>He has been the 40-Year-Old Virgin, Michael Scott, Maxwell Smart, Brick Tamland, Evan Almighty and Burt Wonderstone. All of these roles have been intended to make audiences laugh, but in “Foxcatcher,” Steve Carell defied expectations and completely immersed himself in the role of John du Pont, a real-life wrestling enthusiast whose unsatisfactory life and touch with insanity destroyed his own life and the lives of others as well. For this metamorphic, shocking and career-defining performance, Carell will receive the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>In “Foxcatcher,” Carell is nigh-unrecognizable as du Pont. The manic, smiling, loud energy with which he utilized in his more famous roles, such as in “The Office” and “Anchorman” are gone. In their stead is a somber, downplayed personality, feelings ranging from torn sadness to brimming rage and noticeable mouth breathing, all coming together to recreate a man who emanates a sense of perverse uneasiness. Carell’s performance clearly portrays a very disturbed man and he does it so extremely well that all other actors in the film (including Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) pale in comparison.</p>\n<p>Carell will be awarded the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award in a Tribute celebration at the Arlington on Feb. 6.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8361stZ8n0w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/","id":6034,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6033,6032,6031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2015 Golden Globes: An evening full of laughter, winners and a surprising F-Bomb.","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"19.3 million people watched the 72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards this past Sunday, kicking off awards season with a bang of surprises.

From the shenanigans of Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, to the surprising victors and their tearful speeches, the Globes kept viewers engaged throughout.</p>\n<p>Poehler and Fey hosted for the third time since their first hosting in 2013, and also announced that this would be their last time as the Golden duo. The funny ladies wasted no time in poking fun at the star-studded audience. Despite the ongoing North Korea Sony hackers gag and a cringe-worthy poke at the Bill Cosby scandal, the comedians mostly kept it lighthearted.</p>\n<p>The best joke of the night was Fey’s jab at George Clooney for receiving an award while his wife received nothing for her work as an activist. “George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin this year,” Fey began. “Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an advisor to Kofi Annan regarding Syria and was selected for a three-person U.N. commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Another comedic highlight came from the viewers themselves. The rise of meme generators made Chrissy Teigen’s crying face an instant source of laughs for many when the model’s husband, John Legend, won a Globe for Best Original Song “Glory” from the film “Selma.”</p>\n<p>The big winners of the evening were “Boyhood” for Best Motion Picture, Drama and “The Grand Budapest Hotel” for Best Picture, Musical or Comedy. The latter was a surprise as many thought “Birdman” would take the Globe home. Richard Linklater took home the Globe for Best Director for his film “Boyhood.”</p>\n<p>Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama went to Eddie Redmayne for his outstanding performance as Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything” and Julianne Moore for “Still Alice” in the actress category. For the Comedy/Musical category, Amy Adams won for the second year in a row, (she took the Globe for “American Hustle” in 2014) with “Big Eyes,” and Michael Keaton beat out fellow actors in the same category for his standout performance in “Birdman,” which tells the story of a washed-up actor who stars in a Broadway play to jumpstart his failing career.</p>\n<p>The acceptance speeches had a common theme of overwhelming emotion and genuine shock. Keaton gave a heartfelt speech, calling his son his “very best friend.” Star of “Jane the Virgin” Gina Rodriguez won Best Actress in a TV Series, landing the CW Network with their first Golden Globe winner. The 30-year-old’s speech left many reaching for the tissue box.</p>\n<p>“My dad used to tell me to wake up and say ‘I can and I will,’” a teary Rodriguez said. “Well, Dad, today is a great day. I can and I did!”</p>\n<p>Kevin Spacey delivered the bleeped-out F-bomb heard throughout the Beverly Hilton when he won best actor for his role as power-hungry Frank Underwood in the Netflix series “House of Cards.” As his first win after being nominated eight times, that F-bomb was more than justified.</p>\n<p>Shocking wins filtered throughout the night. New television shows with terrible soap opera names such as “The Affair” and “Transparent” swept the best actress and actor categories and left puzzled faces asking, “What channel are these shows even on?” (FYI: “The Affair” is on Showtime and “Transparent” streams on Amazon.)</p>\n<p>While the Golden Globes may not be as thrilling as the Emmys or as popular as the Oscars, the show does its job. As the kickoff to awards season, the Globes gives a solid excuse to put on PJ’s, drink wine, eat some fancy cheese and watch the stars we admire be rewarded for bringing their characters to life.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/","id":6003,"author":{"id":744,"name":"Brianna Guzman"},"related":[6002,6001,6000],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Big Eyes” Review: Amy Adams rules in biographical.

In 1970, Margaret announced to the world via radio from Hawaii that she was the true painter, which was later proven in a dramatic lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Although the film is billed as a comedy-drama, it progressively changes genres as the narrative unravels. At one point, it’s a heartwarming (albeit a little rushed) romantic comedy, then it switches to an angst-filled drama, before suddenly segueing into a thankfully brief scene that feels like something out of a B-grade slasher film. “Big Eyes” ends on the courtroom battle that defined and concluded the Keane vs. Keane conflict. While the genre-switches do their part to portray the deterioration of the Keane relationship, the aforementioned wannabe slasher bit felt too goofy and out-of-place to be taken seriously.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Waltz’s and Burton’s characterization of Walter Keane aids the film in a “not to be taken seriously” path. Waltz portrays Walter as a charming, kind man whose touch with fame and fortune turns him into a monster. A seriously sociopathic monster, apparently, as evidenced by the scenes when he attempts to stab an art-critic (Terence Stamp) in the face with a fork. Afterward, he throws a temper tantrum and then attempts to burn his wife and stepdaughter alive inside his own house, all while peeking through the keyhole and giddily proclaiming, “I see you!” Walter Keane may have been a con-artist and a jerk, but it’s doubtful that he was a murderously gleeful psychopath.</p>\n<p>Adams, however, manages to carry the film, convincingly showing Margaret’s disillusionment with her husband’s behavior and the sorrow she feels as someone else takes credit for her work. She also imbues a good dose of anxiety that actually manages to make Walter intimidating at times; the effect he has on her takes a visible toll. Adams handled her character development excellently.</p>\n<p>“Big Eyes” also endearingly captures retro San Francisco: the bright colors, the clothes, the cars, the snobby attitudes that put modern art on a pedestal and rejected everything else. It’s all there. It’s done so well, it’s almost like watching an extended “Mad Men” episode.  The movie’s visual palette is, to sum it up, a work of art (excuse the cheesiness).</p>\n<p>While the film is tonally inconsistent, and Waltz is a bit too hammy, “Big Eyes” does a good enough job of telling the story, and the parts of the film that are good are <em>really, </em>really good.  It’s an interesting new addition to Burton’s usually Gothic group of films.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung eagerly awaits the return of “Mad Men.” </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

It makes sense that we update them every generation,” said Kendrick.</p>\n<p>“As Cinderella, I had to be an overthinking, over-logical princess. I think modern women have a tendency to overthink everything and not trust their gut. We have to look at everything from every angle,” said Kendrick. “Cinderella does that [through the whole movie] until something that she really has to reckon with happens. When the community is in crisis, suddenly it’s very clear to her what’s important.”</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old actress from Maine continues to diversify her acting repertoire. Having played Bella Swan’s high school friend Jessica in “Twilight,” an irascible employee in “Up in the Air” and a pouty college freshman in “Pitch Perfect,” she now plays the ultimate fairy tale princess.</p>\n<p>Kendrick did not think she was worthy of such a role at first. “When I found out they were making ‘Into the Woods’ I was like, ‘Oh great, I’ll audition for Little Red,’ and they’re like ‘No, a real child is going to play that part because it’s a film,’” she said in a recent interview with Access Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“Playing Cinderella was frightening. It’s a completely different vocal range than I’m used to and really a sensibility I’m not used to, which is being open and kind and soft and vulnerable,” furthered Kendrick. “I usually play kind of funny, hard characters.”</p>\n<p>For those who missed Ellen DeGeneres’s newsflash last week, Chris Pine also sings in the movie. While Kendrick adjusted to playing such a legendary role, the “Star Trek” actor had doubts about finding his perfect pitch.</p>\n<p>He auditioned for “Into the Woods” with Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” “I auditioned for [director] Rob Marshall in his living room. He was very kind, noticed that I was nervous and he and John — his partner — joined me in singing the song and made me feel more comfortable,” he recalled.</p>\n<p>Pine discussed the change from performing country songs in “Small Town Saturday Night” to singing music by Sondheim, the architect of “West Side Story” and “Sweeney Todd.” “The musical theater genre is very specific and quite different than the country music I had done before. I had fun learning the ins and outs of the genre and I had a lot of incredibly talented people who had worked in this medium before — from Anna to Meryl — so I had great company.”</p>\n<p>Kendrick compared filming this movie to singing in her previous musical. “It was a lot harder. We are singing pop music in ‘Pitch Perfect’ and we’re singing Sondheim here. It was an unbelievable challenge, but singing Sondheim is so rewarding and fulfilling and it’s just a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>Despite the actors’ qualms, director Rob Marshall knew all along that their synergy was special. “I think it’s just a testament to the creativity of Rob Marshall to see somebody like me as a Cinderella figure,” said the “Pitch Perfect” actress.</p>\n<p>Pine and Kendrick share fairy-tale-like chemistry, constantly laughing and poking fun at each other. “I had a lot of fun making the prince a buffoon,” said Pine. “I had a lot of fun watching Chris be a buffoon,” teased Kendrick.

Although that promise will likely be broken like most other New Year’s resolutions, it cannot be denied that “The Office” star’s performance as real-life wrestling enthusiast John du Pont in “Foxcatcher” is a surprising one.</p>\n<p>Carell’s awkward body language, slightly-stammering pattern of speech and beady stare as du Pont brought back to life a very disturbed man. Although he can’t help receiving so many award nominations because this role stands in such contrast with his more famous ones, Carell effectively proved that he is much more than a funny actor.</p>\n<p>Throughout the film, du Pont was an object of both curiosity and anxiety; almost unknowable and even a little sinister. Unless you are aware of du Pont’s real-life diagnosis as a paranoid schizophrenic (something never elaborated on in the film), you may be confused over the reasoning behind his actions at the film’s climax.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Channing Tatum delivers an equal amount of intensity into his role as forgotten Olympic medalist wrestler Mark Shultz. Much of Tatum’s performance is concentrated on his emotions: the disappointment he feels with life, the joy he finds with his newfound purpose and the anger stemming from rejection. Mark Ruffalo also delivers a somber, subdued performance as Dave Shultz, Mark’s brother.</p>\n<p>Mark is saved from a lifestyle bordering on poverty by du Pont, who seeks to accelerate the Olympic medalist’s career while doing the same with his own. And that brings out the film’s theme: wanting to feel worthwhile in the eyes of others. Mark wants to make du Pont proud, praising him at first, but later acting angry and stoic around him after feeling abused. It’s rather refreshing to watch a film with a message.</p>\n<p>Du Pont also wants his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) to appreciate his determination. Her lack of interest garners sympathy for this character, sympathy that is emphasized by the sad piano background music. Music is used sparingly in “Foxcatcher,” and using it in a melancholy scene made audiences feel what the character was going through emotionally.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up, the film’s strength lies in its atmosphere and underlying emotion: the somber, quiet subtlety leading to uneasiness and doubt and to the release of rage. Emotions play a big role in the plot and characterization.</p>\n<p>So, is the film worth seeing? Honestly, not really. While it is very well-acted and interesting at its core, the movie feels extremely slow and plodding. “Foxcatcher” is methodical, and takes its time to build up to important events. The buildup is, like the film, subtle and not flashy. If anything, a good reason to go see the film is to replace your mental image of quirky Michael Scott with the plotting du Pont.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung has finally forgiven Carell for

defining chapter” of the middle of the Middle-Earth saga is like saying “Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace” is the best of the “Star Wars” movies. The film is not downright awful, although it leans precariously towards that status at certain points. “The Hobbit” trilogy has been consistently marred by several problems since the first film, and unfortunately, Peter Jackson either had no time to wise up or didn’t care to in the first place.</p>\n<p>For starters, the vast majority of the dwarf company are still uninteresting and underutilized. Beside the main three (Thorin, Fili and Kili, a.k.a. the good-looking dwarves), it’s nigh-impossible to remember the names of the others. There’s no reason to anyways, because all you see them doing is standing around to mope, essentially reduced to extras.</p>\n<p>A third of the film focuses on Thorin stricken with “dragon’s sickness,” or as this critic would call it, “mandatory conflict disease.” Thorin is almost instantly reduced to the role of a clichéd jerk, blind to both advice and reason. However, credit is due for the fact that he manages to come out of his delirium by himself; that was refreshing. But Tauriel (Kate from ABC’s hit series “LOST”) still has no personality and, as a result, the romance between she and Kili suffers substantially.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Several plot-threads are left unresolved. The Arkenstone gets lost in the great scriptwriting void. The forced comic relief does continuously annoying things and then vanishes halfway through the movie without having done anything important. Saruman makes a promise that is not elaborated on. The fate of a kingdom is left uncertain, as is that of a grieving character.  And yet for some reason, Jackson thought it was important for us to see that Bilbo rescued his personal belongings from being auctioned off.</p>\n<p>But most damning of all is the fact that apparently, Middle-Earth was devoid of the laws of physics before the Fellowship was formed. There were several moments in the film that garnered snickers from the audience this critic was in, and not intentionally. From Legolas ascending a stream of falling rocks to a cart sailing over a batch of characters and conveniently colliding into a troll’s chest, it was as if Jackson wanted to conjure memories of children’s cartoons in lieu of making more serious epics.</p>\n<p>The rest of the film was … serviceable. Not stupendous, but all right. Jackson traded makeup for computer-generated imagery (CGI) for many of his creatures, and while that makes the film look somewhat fake, it doesn’t detract from the movie as a whole. And it’s pretty good CGI, as well. The battle scenes were impressive and even include what might be a call-back to “Dune.” An undoubtedly great sequence was the fight at Dol Guldur. Sporting great choreography, fist-pumping moments and a good dose of nostalgia, it was truly amazing — an island of epicness in a sea of meh.</p>\n<p>This critic wonders what the ad campaign managers were smoking when they called this movie “the defining chapter.” It’s not. It should be called the “beating the dead horse chapter.”  “The Battle of the Five Armies,” like the other “Hobbit” films, was okay, being alright at best while still sporting scenes so dumb and contrived it makes this critic wonder why Peter Jackson doesn’t get as much crap as George Lucas.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung has a message for Peter Jackson: Please, for the love of Eru Ilúvatar, don’t make “The Silmarillion” into a film.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">David Fincher and Gillian Flynn adapted Flynn’s novel to the big screen to chillingly effective results. Portraying the fruits of an unhappy marriage, the film follows former writer Nick Dunne’s (Ben Affleck) quest to discover where his wife disappeared to, all while enduring the media’s thinly-veiled suggestions that he’s possibly sleeping with his sister and murdered his wife, satirizing how quick people are to judge and America’s modern “guilty until proven innocent” attitude.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While Dunne has done undeniably jackassy things, our sympathies are quickly thrown into confusion when it is revealed that his wife’s diary is stretching the truth a little too taut. Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) is a triumph of a character; she is thrown into the role of an unhappy wife, but breaks out of that cliché in a unique and unsettling way perhaps never-before-seen in a story.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The movie is an amazing thriller with layered and flawed characters, themes relevant to modern-day life and a performance by Tyler Perry that does not involve him dressing in drag for once!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/esGn-xKFZdUframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/esGn-xKFZdU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Boyhood”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alex Wehrung, <em>Staff Writer</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This movie came out at the perfect time. Filmed over a period of 12 years with all the same actors, “Boyhood” shows Mason Evans Jr.’s (Ellar Coltrane) life from the age of six to his first day at the University of Texas at Austin. What is amazing about this film is that it feels real. Apart from one scene that feels straight out of one of those “Say no to peer pressure and don’t drink!” videos that regularly make rounds at middle schools, one feels like they are actually watching someone’s life as it progresses. As Mason grows older, cute little reminders of our own childhoods are sprinkled around. And like life, the movie is funny, scary, melancholy and joyful. It’s almost an immersive experience. And to add to that, Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke both knock it out of the park as the parents.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/Ys-mbHXyWX4frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Ys-mbHXyWX4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59516\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1544082782\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59515\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59516\" data-attachment-id=\"59516\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/boyhood-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,675\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"boyhood\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59516\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood-1024x576.jpg?resize=400%2C225\" alt=\"photo courtesy of ssba-salon.nl\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boyhood.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-59516\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo courtesy of <em>ssba-salon.nl</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Nightcrawler”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Mackenzie Hart, <em>Staff Writer</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One night, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) stumbles upon a violent car crash beside the highway; flames, bodies on stretchers and all. But what he becomes fixated upon is the man filming the bloodied corpses. Bloom, desperate for work and fascinated by the fast-paced, macabre occupation of crime journalism, tells the man he wants to work with him. The man rejects him, but tells him all he needs to know in one sentence: “If it bleeds, it leads.” And with this, Bloom takes it upon himself to create his own amateur “Nightcrawler” duo.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Really, what makes this movie incredible is the protagonist (and antagonist). Lou Bloom is unpredictable, cunning and calculated — essentially, he fulfills all of the necessary qualifications to be an utter sociopath. Although not for the whole family, “Nightcrawler” will not let you take your eyes away from the screen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It will immerse you, startle you and have you questioning why you’re rooting for Bloom. But really, the best part of the viewing experience is watching in awe as he effortlessly manipulates everyone around him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/u1uP_8VJkDQframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/u1uP_8VJkDQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Wild”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Erika Lee, <em>Staff Writer</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Based on the autobiographical novel by Cheryl Strayed, “Wild” stars Reese Witherspoon as a resilient and broken woman determined to confront her demons and escape the emotional weight of her broken marriage and the death of her mother through hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. She embarks on this<br>\njourney alone, gaining perspective on her past struggles and mistakes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Strayed’s character is not only strong and irrepressible, she is also unafraid to be vulnerable and honest with her emotions throughout the movie. Not to be confused with an actual nature movie or “Into the Wild” starring Emile Hirsch, “Wild” is a heartwarming, hilarious and inspiring movie that shows that anybody could heal and forge a new path in their life. It also made me want to add hiking onto my list of New Year’s Resolutions!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/MvDT42x_NBkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MvDT42x_NBk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/best-of-2014-film/","id":5999,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5998,5997,5996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"More than Just a Cogwheel","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What comes to mind when you hear the word “castle”?

Probably not a walking house fused with cogwheels, steaming pipes and turrets balancing on four thin, metallic bird feet. It may look like a dump but as Director Hayao Miyazaki works to bring Diana Wynne Jones’s novel, <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>, to life in a stunning animation, viewers will soon see, as the people of the magical kingdom of Ingary have, that this walking castle is more than just a few nuts and bolts.</p>\n<p>When Sophie, an eighteen-year-old hat-maker, is cursed with a spell that transforms her into an old woman (courtesy of the Witch of the Waste), she must journey to the Wastes to find a cure. Instead, however, she finds other cursed individuals: a living scarecrow (whom she dubs “Turnip Head”) who leads her to Howl’s castle and Calcifer, a fire-demon who powers the moving castle. Other residents of the castle include Markl, Howl’s young apprentice, and of course, Howl himself, a mysterious and powerful wizard who accepts Sophie as the cleaning lady of his home. During her stay, Calcifer asks for her help in breaking his curse and though Sophie complies in exchange for her own cure, she doesn’t realize what she’s gotten herself into. Tangled in a world of war, sorcery and magic portals, Sophie endeavors to break the curses of her friends and herself and discovers her own strength and magic along the way.</p>\n<p>“Coming-of-age” is one of the many themes featured in the film, although it puts a spin on this idea by aging Sophie into an old woman right off the bat. Sophie is placed in an interesting position as she struggles with adolescent insecurity and self-doubt in a body that most would consider very wise and assured. But as the story progresses, Sophie learns to embrace the complacency that comes with old age and accepts herself (whether old or young), as a beautiful and confident woman.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And what would a Studio Ghibli masterpiece be without Joe Hisaishi’s beautiful soundtrack compositions? Composer of other Studio Ghibli favorites such as “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro<em>,</em>” Hisaishi has a way of creating tracks that don’t just complement the animation, but also breathe life into the film’s story and characters.</p>\n<p>Take the track “Cave of Mind,” for instance. Played when Sophie gets a glimpse into Howl’s childhood, a solemn trumpet solo emphasizes the tragedy that had befallen Howl as well as Calcifer. Though Howl gave his heart to save Calcifer who was then a dying star, it bound Calcifer to Howl and rendered Howl emotionally trapped in an adolescent state. After an orchestrated crescendo, a flute takes over with a playful, fluctuating melody to remind the audience that this is a memory of a boy, a boy who “swallowed a star.” Despite Howl’s power and often outrageous actions, he still has the “heart” of a child and viewers find that the “coming-of-age” theme doesn’t just apply to Sophie.</p>\n<p>With solid characterization and breathtaking music, Hayao Miyazaki presents yet another Studio Ghibli delight in “Howl’s Moving Castle”<em>. </em>As the characters discover for themselves how inner spirit matters more than outer appearance, viewers can also see how this notion of “It’s the inside that counts” presents itself in the titular castle. Sure, it’s no Sleeping Beauty palace blanketed with pixie dust but it doesn’t mean it’s any less magical.<br>\n<em>Howl’s Moving Castle is part of a film series, “Ecological Storytelling: Hayao Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli,” hosted by the Environmental Humanities Center featuring Hayao Miyazaki classics. This event is free and students, faculty and staff are provided with free lunch and the opportunity for a discussion afterwards. Films are screened every Friday at South Hall 2635 from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. until Dec. 12.  </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59117\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-12/more-than-just-a-cogwheel-a-howls-moving-castle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59117\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-12/more-than-just-a-cogwheel-a-howls-moving-castle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-12/more-than-just-a-cogwheel-a-howls-moving-castle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-12/more-than-just-a-cogwheel-a-howls-moving-castle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-12/more-than-just-a-cogwheel-a-howls-moving-castle/","id":5998,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5997,5996,5995],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Horror Story Producer and UCSB Alumni Comes to Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Flipping through television channels often yields the same monotonous results of sitcom after sitcom, recycling the same jokes between different characters and settings.

On Oct. 5, 2011, the American public was reintroduced to a genre that hadn’t been prominent in television for years, if ever: horror. Almost instantaneously, “American Horror Story” garnered a cult-like following, which has only seemed to grow with every new season of the anthology series. From the engaging imagery to the intricate storylines, there’s only so much one can fully process when watching “American Horror Story.” Often the show is taken for little more than entertainment value, and why not? It seems to do a good job at it.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Dec. 1, attendants of a show screening, followed by a talk and Q&amp;A segment with the show’s executive producer and UCSB alumnus Dante Di Loreto in Pollock Theater, got an inside perspective of what actually goes on behind the scenes of the mysterious and captivating series. As it turns out, there’s much more than meets the eye.</p>\n<p>Now in its fourth season, the series has brought back the same core cast to act out a variety of story lines, each exploring a different facet of American history and culture, from the Salem witch trials to the age of traveling freak shows and carnivals.  As it turns out, these seasons are not as divided as it may seem, and avid watchers of the show will soon begin to discover that the varying story lines are interconnected with each other. On this topic, Di Loreto diplomatically declined to offer any comment no matter how hard he was pried. Needless to say, this will call for many rainy afternoons spent re-watching the first few seasons (on Netflix) in search of clues.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The open question portion of the interview opened the floor to audience members to ask Di Loreto questions. Hearing the different questions revealed which unique aspect of the show each person liked most, and all the things different people can take from it. When asked why horror was chosen as the primary theme for the series, his answer was simple: it stimulates the senses. Evidently, horror sells for much of the same reason sex sells: It makes viewers feel something in their bodies that they don’t even need to wrap their heads around.</p>\n<p>Di Loreto also spoke candidly of his life leading up to becoming an executive producer, and all the steps it took to reach his position. This, of course, began with his time spent at UCSB as an undergraduate studying theater in the 1970s, when evidently students “were smoking in class and having sex with the teachers.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB alumnus offered advice on the most important part of becoming a producer, or anything in the entertainment industry, for that matter. His answer? “Friends.” Di Loreto stressed the importance of keeping close relationships with others who also hold a creative vision, and not being cynical about what you want to do. Through close relationships with like-minded people, avant-garde endeavors like “American Horror Story” are born.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/","id":6017,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6016,6015,6014],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":13,"route":"/categories/artsweek/film-and-tv","highestPage":15}},"__N_SSG":true}
