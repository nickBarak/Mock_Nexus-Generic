While I commend Marvel’s efforts to introduce unknown superheroes to a wider audience, the film still fell into the standard, stale Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) formula, once you remove the 80s, “Star Wars” vibe to it. (The movie was basically “The Avengers” in space, without prior “set-up movies.”) Nevertheless, the film was also so fun and bizarre, out of all the MCU movies, that I basically assured people that, if handled well, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” could break away from the MCU’s typical mold.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this follow-up was still plagued by standard problems of the MCU. Information was basically spelled out to the audience without any chance for them to connect the dots. In some scenes, information, whether it was audio or visual, was repeated to — I guess — make the scene more emotional, when it actually made it repetitive. There were moments when the music or actors’ expressions could have easily conveyed everything, but the characters just explained it after I understood what they meant or felt. It’s like writer-director James Gunn (or some studio executive at Disney) didn’t think that it was enough for the actors to communicate the information, so lines were written in to reinforce the emotion.</p>\n<p>The film also felt incohesive and clunky. An advantage the original “Guardians of the Galaxy” had is that the completely generic MCU plot at least ran at a consistent pace. Here, the sequel aimlessly meandered for a while until it finally started to pick up near the hour mark (that’s an estimate, though, because you really don’t feel the pace at all). After the climax, it lost too much steam because it went on longer than probably necessary. And, while I liked the general area in which the film ended, I feel as if there should have still been some closure, as it ended in an abrupt manner.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To be honest, this movie felt like Marvel’s “Return of the Jedi,” because while the structure and other weaknesses certainly weighed it down, it also contained some of the best elements of the MCU overall.</p>\n<p>Even though I believed that most of the main characters did not undergo the most critical development possible, Gunn made up for it with Yondu. Michael Rooker put all of his emotion and dedication into this performance to create a solid arc for his character. The movie devoted some time to interact and form connections with the different guardians of the galaxy. We actually got to spend time seeing Rooker’s emotional conflict and the ways in which he handles it. By the end of the movie, his arc felt complete and satisfying. In a film with five main characters, the one you end up empathizing with the most is one of the side characters.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77775\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"694483757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77774\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77775\" data-attachment-id=\"77775\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=2048%2C1975&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1975\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"guardians of the galaxy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=250%2C241&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=888%2C857&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77775\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-250x241.jpg?resize=250%2C241\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=250%2C241&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=768%2C741&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=1024%2C988&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77775\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of KCSR</p></div>\n<p>As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking about how great the marketing ended up being for this film. Even though I heard about one character’s role in the comics, the trailers and posters led me to believe that Gunn was giving his own interpretation of the character that fit in the context of the film. As the plot unfolded, however, the movie completely subverted my expectations. For the first time since “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” I was completely taken off guard by one of the MCU’s movies.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this was not the only factor that indicated to me that this movie had strong elements to it because the villain was actually decent. One could tell that Gunn most likely restrained himself when writing this movie, as he made it feel more small-scale and (thankfully) did not integrate Infinity Stones or any other broad MCU plot device into the plot. This proved beneficial because the movie did not rely on anything seen (even if it was for one frame) in past MCU installments to make the movie stronger. Also, while the villain’s motivation was external (in fact, you see it affecting other people), the plot’s central conflict was fixed between the guardians of the galaxy and the villain. In fact, while “Awesome Mix Vol. 2” did not play as big of a role, the song chosen to play during one instance of this conflict heightened my emotional response to that scene overall, as the heroes were already given a drive to want to defeat the villain.</p>\n<p>Because of this change of pace, I could feel this film trying to break away from the MCU formula, as it, at the very least, still felt strong if taken out of context from the cinematic universe. While the first movie had more flow, this sequel felt more daring. Even though its plot did meander before kicking into motion, this sequel did not feel like it was stalling for time until the release of the new Avengers movie, “Infinity War.” Instead, it focused on a specific storyline for the remainder of the film. Additionally, the best part of this movie is that it still had a specific function in the larger MCU story, despite feeling so distant from it.</p>\n<p>This is a case in which the amount of positive elements outweighed the negatives and gave the movie a pretty good final result. Even though we are deep into the hold of the MCU, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” felt like a much-needed breath of fresh air. Though I found this film to be uneven and overly simplified at times, I also believe Gunn tried his hardest to distinguish it from the rest of the MCU. I just hope that “Spiderman: Homecoming” and “Thor: Ragnarok” try to break the Marvel formula when they arrive later this year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>A screening of two episodes from season five of the show was followed by a Q&amp;A session that had each of the three talented guests sharing insight into the inner workings of the masterfully crafted and politically charged award-winning show. Their chemistry dominated the theater, proving true the afternoon’s main ringing theme: collaboration crafts the best comedy.</p>\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus took the audience back to her being sold on the idea alone before there was even a script.</p>\n<p>“What appealed to me was the actual, very seemingly simple concept, which was a female vice president who’s profoundly unhappy.” She had done plenty of network television before and was ready to “shake it up” with a move to cable, and HBO provided a more than welcoming home. At HBO, “VEEP” is able to have freedom in the creative process that other networks would restrict.</p>\n<p>“With Dave at the helm, scripts are very well formed by the time we come to set,” said Louis-Dreyfus, beginning to describe the hectic creative process of “VEEP.” But once the scripts arrive, the scenes and dialogue often change and evolve on the day of shooting. The crew constantly works to, as Mandel puts it, “thicken the broth,” working through the scenes to find the right dialogue, delivery and pace to ultimately arrive at a polished scene and rhythm. This on-the-go molding applies to the general feel of the show as well.</p>\n<p>“Messiness is our bread and butter,” explained Mandel, describing the way in which the show strives for a grounding in reality. Nothing is perfectly enunciated or said, and every movement is far from perfectly performed. It’s what Louis-Dreyfus refers to as “jujjing” (the spelling of which I could never figure out), which is the practice of making a scene feel more real by appearing more messy.</p>\n<p>For Mandel, when “you have the outline right, the jokes can change,” but the overall story stays intact. While the specifics and details are often improvised and fleshed out in the moment, the production remains united in crafting these scenes from the writing to the acting all the way down to the editing, which Louis-Dreyfus and Mandel often work on themselves.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77572\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2044763747\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77571\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77572\" data-attachment-id=\"77572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/veep_selina/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=798%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"798,475\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Veep_Selina\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=798%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina-250x149.jpeg?resize=250%2C149\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?resize=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?w=798&amp;ssl=1 798w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Go Read a Book</p></div>\n<p>Just like with the unity of the production crew, the producers are equally adamant about keeping their audience together, being careful not to alienate any demographic based on political opinion. When confronted about the show’s role in addressing the overwhelmingly controversial presidency, Louis-Dreyfus stepped in to clarify the show’s authorial intent on such a divided political environment.</p>\n<p>“Our show is not, in fact, a parody; our show is a comedy about political culture,” stated Louis-Dreyfus.</p>\n<p>She pointed out that the show has never actually referenced a real political candidate since Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p>“In our universe, the “VEEP” universe, the world shifted after Reagan,” and ever since then fictional candidates have stood in for real-life political parties Louis-Dreyfus continued. While she went on to note that parody shows like “Saturday Night Live” and “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” do “fabulous jobs” of parody, she reiterated that their objective at “VEEP” has never been to explicitly parody a real-life politician. The show is also careful to avoid identifying the political party of any character, and as a result, both Republicans and Democrats seem to “dig” the show. In fact, Louis-Dreyfus claimed to have met both conservative Republicans who believed “VEEP” was making fun of the Democrats and, inversely, liberal Democrats who believed “VEEP” was mocking conservative Republicans.</p>\n<p>So while the show is based in politics, it isn’t a clear political advocate for any particular viewpoint. Mandel further clarified that “VEEP” is ultimately a show about “wanting power” instead of some bold political analysis. However, Mandel still had a few quips to rattle off about the current political landscape, expressing his sympathy with the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>When thinking through the stupidest thing a president could do for his own fictional Selina Meyer, or when brainstorming what the worst press conference should look like on his show, Mandel has to concede: He simply cannot compete with the Trump Administration. And while he has a “hard enough time doing 10 episodes,” he can’t even begin to imagine how hard the real-life White House must work to get through 100 real-world episodes of their own political nightmare.</p>\n<p>Overall, while those at “VEEP” may work to keep their real-world critiques absent from the show, in order to maintain an undivided audience, the real world political landscape is almost inevitably blending together with the best in comedy.</p>\n<p>“Script to Screen: VEEP” ended with an uproarious applause as the theater said goodbye to what may be the most impressive trio of comedians to have graced Pollock thus far. We can only hope that if they return, President Meyer will by then have done far worse than our own commander in chief.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/","id":6109,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[6108,6107,6106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Raging Bull’ Takes on Violence with Movie Magic","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-08-at-12.31.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-08-at-12.31.10-PM.png?resize=684%2C515&ssl=1","description":"Ultimately, it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMotta’s life through the 23 years used to account his rise and fall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the 1970s, director Martin Scorsese burst into the film industry with a promising future. Collaborating with actor Robert De Niro on works such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, the duo consolidated their strong director-actor relationship early on in their careers. This collaboration lasted well into their respective careers — their big collaboration film of the ’80s is the now-classic Raging Bull.</p>\n<p>Based on the real-life story of boxer Jake LaMotta, Raging Bull recounts various fights and life events that marked the rise and fall of the renowned boxer. On Thursday, April 20, UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center hosted makeup artist and UCSB alumnus Michael Westmore to discuss the making of the movie with film and media studies professor Anna Brusutti.</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A discussion after the screening of the film, Brusutti remarked that one of the main themes in the film is the idea of violence. During the first match of the film, Scorsese hints at the violent nature of the boxing matches that will influence LaMotta’s personal life. In the first boxing match alone, the hectic nature of the event suggests that the audience demands to see this violence for their own enjoyment. At the beginning of the film, the audience already knows that LaMotta has a violent side as he displays a verbal attack (and small physical one) toward somebody early on the film. While a montage later in the film can be interpreted as a passage of time, it could also suggest a part of his life when his violent nature began to slowly build inside in context of this theme, as suggested by the various fights interlaced into the sequence. Ultimately, Scorsese also proves that violence is an endless cycle that can influence others to act similarly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Most of this is demonstrated through LaMotta’s personality and De Niro’s portrayal. As a character, LaMotta is brutal in the ring yet controlling outside. It’s almost as if Scorsese is trying to make the point that LaMotta was a product of a society that wanted him to beat people mercilessly to gain acceptance from them. As a result, LaMotta exerted complete control over those he loved, as demonstrated when he questioned any time his second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) kissed other men as a form of greeting or remarked that someone was simply good-looking.</p>\n<p>While LaMotta’s character on paper would be enough to show this change, it was De Niro’s dedication to the role that made the finished performance more meaningful. Westmore remarked, “[De Niro] trained so thoroughly that trainers were saying, ‘He could actually go into the ring [and] he probably would win.” While it is commonly accepted for actors to fully dedicate themselves to a certain role such as weight loss, Westmore reminisced on various times when De Niro would want the most minute parts of his character to be as accurate as possible.</p>\n<p>In one aspect of filming the movie, De Niro wanted his hair to look like LaMotta’s instead of wearing a wig. Westmore explained spending hours trying to rearrange De Niro’s hair to look as accurate as possible. For one scene, Brusutti noted a discontinuity in the flow of the scene which involved confetti. Both Scorsese and De Niro wanted to keep the confetti on LaMotta’s face, and the scene ended up taking 10 days to shoot because Westmore had to put confetti on De Niro’s face every shoot.</p>\n<p>While De Niro’s performance helped note the certain points of LaMotta’s life that led him to a violent path, the sound in the film was used well to make audience members hear the impact of his destructiveness. One can hear all the punches hit, as the sound is what can give audience members the reaction the movie wants them to have. In one scene involving LaMotta’s brother slamming someone’s head with a car door, one does not see the person affected by this action. However, with the sound, one can clearly picture the possible image in his or her head.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMotta’s life through the 23 years used to account his rise and fall. Regarding its use of violence, one can see the effect the punches in the ring have on a boxer. Westmore explained how he used tubes on De Niro’s face for the bloody punches. Even though the film is shot in black and white, the showcasing of blood is still effective for the plot of the movie, as there is little color contrast as suggested by Westmore at the discussion, and brings about a more poetic style to the scenes.</p>\n<p>However, the makeup is also used for the most subtle details in the film. Westmore uses it for smaller moments, such as the makeup done to LaMotta to show his roughness and Vickie to show her purity. He also uses his skills in makeup to create front cast-ons to make De Niro appear older than he is. Westmore explained that the real LaMotta’s skull was thicker than most men’s.</p>\n<p>At the time the film was released, Westmore had tried to bring makeup to the forefront. Westmore was given a special Oscar for his efforts in this film. A year after this film was released, the Oscars created the “Best Makeup and Hairstyling” category. In addition to the screening and Q&amp;A, some of the makeup work and props used for the film were on display, such as notes for “Sugar Ray” Robinson, makeup and three prosthetic noses.</p>\n<p>Westmore even explained to the audience that Raging Bull was more of a documentary, as there were people involved in the real events who helped inform the cast and crew of what actually happened. Indeed, it’s no wonder that UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center wanted to screen this film, additionally inviting Westmore, who provided audience members insight into the process of filmmaking through his personal experiences.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/","id":5827,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5826,5825,5824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Edge of Seventeen’ Showcases Realistic Teen Angst","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With her character’s personal problems well established, Steinfeld is able to convey the struggles experienced by average high school students, showing passionate emotions on screen.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>High schools can be portrayed in an exaggerated manner in the entertainment world. The distinct, contrasting colors and clean faces from director John Hughes’s work or Netflix’s recent teen drama “13 Reasons Why” create romanticized ideas about a campus atmosphere that, by most people, is not actually experienced in reality. On Thursday, April 13, UCSB’s Pollock Theater presented a Script to Screen for director Kelly Fremon Craig’s 2016 film “The Edge of Seventeen,” which portrays high school slightly more honestly.</p>\n<p>This film follows Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) as she tries to navigate her junior year of high school. Various conflicts or situations involving her brother (Blake Jenner), her best friend (Haley Lu Richardson), a few classmates (Hayden Szeto and Alexander Calvert and one of her teachers (Woody Harrelson) arise and help her break out of her introverted, envious personality to become a more open-minded person.</p>\n<p>With her character’s personal problems well established, Steinfeld is able to convey the struggles experienced by average high school students, showing passionate emotions on screen. Craig attended a Q&amp;A discussion that occurred after the screening, and a part of the filmmaking process she extensively talked about was casting and working with the actors, especially Steinfeld. Craig explained that little touches, such as a look or an aside, really distinguished Steinfeld from many other actresses of her age. This was so special to Craig when considering how stressful the casting process was for her up until Steinfeld came to audition.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I spent a year seeing it and thinking … I don’t think we can make the movie because we just can’t find her,” Craig explained to Pollock Theater director Matt Ryan during the discussion.</p>\n<p>With regards to the supporting actors in the film, Craig seemed to have an easy time working with them, whether this was their first film or one of many projects.

That’s so much better,’ so I never want to step on that moment. I ended up not doing a lot of rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>This work mentality displays the good results that come about when actors and directors collaborate well with each other when making the film.</p>\n<p>Craig illustrated the complexity of these characters when Ryan asked her about any advice she would give to aspiring screenwriters. She explained that thinking about how the film would be if a side character was the main character can provide you with a perspective on what they want. “A lot of times, when you’re writing those peripheral characters, it’s easy to just think about whatever you’re trying to accomplish with the main character [with] these people helping you with it,” she explained. She talked about how imagining them as the hero is important to make them more complicated.</p>\n<p>It is important that the characters be this intricate and complicated because the actor’s delivery and expressions are crucial to having the audience truly feel the message of the movie. Given the setting, the message of the film is relatable to anyone who has ever been through high school. The idea that students believe they know everything about people and think they are alone is a problem that can mentally affect them. There are students who may feel as if they do not belong to a certain graduating year or group of friends because of assumptions they build up about their peers.</p>\n<p>Craig explained how this theme tied back to Nadine’s character arc, saying, “Particularly at that age, you can really feel like that’s the truth, and then you start to realize that everybody in the world is carrying some sort of pain. Everybody’s been through something tough regardless of how they present [themselves].”</p>\n<p>While the film does have a central message it wants Nadine to realize, Craig also uses moments in Nadine’s arc to address other problems or illustrate tropes associated with the current generation’s high school environment.</p>\n<p>Certain turning points in various relationships Nadine has with other supporting characters are also executed while showing a certain contemporary idea. For example, the film deals with the modern issue of sexual assault in high schools. When shooting a scene involving this topic, Craig had a conversation with the two actors involved before filming it because she wanted to be as honest about the situation as possible. She wanted to show the scene in such a frank way because she believed “if you’re tiptoeing or you’re awkward it just makes the whole thing awkward.” Indeed, to address a problem this tragic, one would not want to shy away from depicting the moment.</p>\n<p>Craig clearly showed both passion and dedication to this project, going so far as to spend six months in a high school to truly capture the spirit of the modern teenage environment. “The Edge of Seventeen” brought a fresh new look into a genre of films that have been known to have many clichés attached to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/","id":5826,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5825,5824,5823],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Ghost in the Hollow Shell of a Movie","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-2017-trailer-ed.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-2017-trailer-ed.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” sets a shining standard of mediocrity for action films and further serves as proof that live-action manga adaptations (well, more like anime adaptations, in this case) are generally not good ideas. Of course, giving writing duties to one of the minds behind “Transformers” hardly helps. The final product is a substandard action film that drowns the humanistic themes of its source material under a deluge of headache-inducing CGI cityscapes and a painfully bland corporate conspiracy story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, the first person to have their brain inserted into a purely cybernetic body. As a result, she can hack into the cyberbrains of other people and has superhuman abilities. Basically, she’s playing Black Widow again, but now her skin-tight bodysuit is flesh-toned. After her transformation, the corporate mind behind the Major’s creation, Cutter, comes up with the brilliant idea of taking this investment he holds so dear to his heart and putting her in a counter-terrorism unit. Smart business move there, bud. Put your experimental business asset in a profession in which getting a bullet in the ass is right in the job description. Then again, what can one expect when the film’s idea of a pre-asskicking one-liner is “The truth is … I wasn’t built to dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Major spends the first third of her own screen-time questioning her humanity, a theme central to the original manga source material that depicts a world in which cybernetic augmentation is as common as wearing a watch. The film makes this abundantly clear to us by showing a variety of humans who have undergone some sort of modification or other: chips in the brain to play music, cybernetic eyes, stuff like that. However, this deep thematic content goes down the toilet pretty fast in favor of “Matrix”-esque gunfights (in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow motion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and the tortuously cliché story of the super-agent searching for their forgotten past. Hey, DreamWorks. Jason Bourne called. He wants his plot back. Oh, and he’s also suing for defamation.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. Every 10 minutes or so, you’re treated to the sight of gigantic, colorful holographic advertisements pulled straight out of “Blade Runner” and waving at you. Once, it’s cool. Twice, it’s artistic. Eight times and the scenery is not only overpowering whatever character is in the shot, but the movie is also treating you like a complete moron. Yes, I know it’s a sci-fi movie, thank you very much. Now get to the next scene before I decide to go sneak in to see “Logan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps my analysis is a little too harsh. The film is at least visually inventive and arresting, that much can be said. Holograms aren’t used in any groundbreaking story manner, but in small touches, like having them disintegrate like sand upon the end of a conversation, which lends at least a little personality to their measly existence.  And the Major’s deep dive, her hacking into another cyber-brain, provides for a darkly hallucinatory experience (albeit one that is, weirdly enough, evocative of both “Code Lyoko” and Kingdom Hearts)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all its attempts to divert your attention that there is little under the surface of this shell, the third act kicks in hard. As the pieces fall into place, things actually start getting at least a little interesting when the questions about the Major’s identity are answered. The thing is, as someone who was at least a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">familiar with the source material, I was able to see the twist coming from a mile off.  Maybe others won’t and will be blown away by it. The interesting question though, without giving too much away, is can a movie be truly accused of whitewashing when the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">character </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herself has been literally whitewashed?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the film does not seem to care about the implications, nor does the protagonist dwell upon her revelation. “Ghost in the Shell” is still a dumb action movie, ground into a pulp by the Hollywood wringer. It may look somewhat the same as Masamune Shirow’s work, but its soul has been rent and mangled, rendered unrecognizable. The best I can say about the movie is that it takes the indecipherable technobabble of its source material and trades it in for a couple of entertaining and occasionally seizure-inducing combat scenes.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fellow Artsweek writer Ryan Hykes rates this movie an 8/10.  And that’s why he writes album reviews.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/","id":5833,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5832,5831,5830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Filmmakers Join Forces with Jack Johnson","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Set to a soundtrack by alumnus Jack Johnson, the film will cover four unique students and have their interconnected stories unfold in Isla Vista over the course of their last day of Spring Quarter.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Since the beginning of Winter Quarter, a small group of six film and media studies students have been working to create a love letter to I.V.:  a music-inspired visual album about love in our beautiful town of Isla Vista, California.</p>\n<p>Set to a soundtrack by alumnus Jack Johnson, the film will cover four unique students and have their interconnected stories unfold in Isla Vista over the course of their last day of Spring Quarter. The website promoting the project states, “For some of these students, it is the beginning of an epic four-year journey, while for the others it is the end and the ultimate culmination of their college experiences. For all, however, it is a time of celebration and reflection.”</p>\n<p>For those of you who are unsure what a “visual album” consists of, it is essentially a series of music videos that come together to create a single story. The characters don’t have any dialogue; the story is told entirely through the songs used. And the music used for this short film is by a famous UCSB graduate whom we all know and love.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Danielle Erwin, a fourth-year film and media studies major and the producer of the project, said, “The music really drives the plot of the story with the lyrics and vibe of the song.

He’s kind of a legend in the community,” said Erwin. “We all just kind of fell in love with the project.”<br>\nAbout 15 minutes in length and told through five of Johnson’s songs, the project was initially created due to the negative media attention I.V. has received over the past several years. Co-director and writer of the visual album Connor Haines, a fifth-year in the film and media studies department, came up with the idea while Googling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If you ever Google-search Isla Vista, it’s not the greatest thing in the world,” Haines stated. “I was sitting in class one day, and that’s what I was doing. I felt like there needed to be more positive ideas of I.V. and UCSB. I was trying to think of ways to do that, and the idea of a visual album came to my head.”</p>\n<p>Explaining the album and comparing it to Beyoncé’s Lemonade or Frank Ocean’s Endless, Haines elaborated that he came up with a pitch for Jack Johnson to be able to use his music in a soundtrack about students’ lives on the last day of Spring Quarter. Erwin stated, “As seniors creating a love letter to UCSB and I.V., it was perfect to use Jack Johnson.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the team, Joe Palladino, the film and media studies advisor, was able to get in contact with Johnson’s wife, Kim, who then passed the message along to her husband.</p>\n<p>“[Palladino] sent the pitch I designed to Kim, and she emailed back and said that Jack and her were both on board for the project, and it was as simple as that. They got back to us the same day; it was amazing,” said Haines.</p>\n<p>Now that the group has the rights to Johnson’s music (using “Better Together,” “Rodeo Clowns,” “Staple It Together,” “Talk of the Town” and “Symbol in my Driveway”), they are starting the filming process.<br>\nHaines enthused, “For prospective students and parents, they don’t really get to see the experiences all the students have. The goal is to show what it really means to be a Gaucho.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76668\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"578485964\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76665\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76668\" data-attachment-id=\"76668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/ucsb-filmmakers-join-forces-with-jack-johnson/jack-johnson-film-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jack johnson film 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76668\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Mika Pham</p></div>\n<p>The visual album has already raised $1,875, and the group is continuing to fundraise for the project.<br>\nThe students working on the short film want it to carry the warmth and joy that makes Jack Johnson’s songs so special. Their love for I.V. is truly the driving force behind the project. If they do not reach their fundraising goal, they intend to continue making the film in any way possible. Their fundraising website expresses, “For us, this is a labor of love, and we will finish it no matter what.”</p>\n<p>Haines passionately concluded, “I.V. has gone through a lot in the last couple years. Right, wrong or indifferent, a lot of the attention directed toward our community and this school is negative.

Actor Hugh Jackman has played this part so well that his version of the character has become a very recognizable pop culture icon in recent years. Now, after eight movies, he will end his long run as the well-known superhero in his final film as the mutant hero, “Logan.”</p>\n<p>It’s the year 2029, and mutants have been nearly extinct. Wolverine, or Logan, has lost his healing ability, and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has been affected by Alzheimer’s, which has left him unable to fully control his powers. They are on the edge of the Mexican border, working to eventually live a better life, when they accept the calling of a woman who wants them to escort a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across America to the Canadian border.</p>\n<p>Despite developing over the course of the franchise, Jackman’s character undergoes the fabled hero’s journey as if his character is just being introduced to us. By placing huge limitations on his mutant powers, Wolverine feels different from how he was in past installments, as tension for his life slowly begins to rise. While it is slightly helpful to understand Logan’s relationship with Charles Xavier in past films, one does not need to know any specific events of previous entries to follow this film’s plot. It almost seems as though director James Mangold approached this story as if the other X-Men movies never happened.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of this, “Logan” distances itself from all previous X-Men installments tonally and stylistically, as it earns an R rating. Apart from bloodier action scenes and more profanity, Mangold uses this opportunity to create a more mature movie. The themes and mood reflect this, as the setting is not as colorful as it was in the franchise. The cinematography and costume design suggest a harsher world, where the threat from the enemy is worse than ever. With this setup, Mangold tries to break apart from the comic book genre to make something entirely different. Despite having great action scenes, the best moments of the movie were the simple character moments that the MCU movies typically don’t care to include. Sharing themes with the stories “Children of Men” or “The Last of Us,” the comic book elements are seamlessly integrated into the film, as the movie doesn’t feel remotely like a “comic book movie.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76316\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"239781688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76314\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76316\" data-attachment-id=\"76316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/logan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"logan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>That is, until the second half.</p>\n<p>Up to this point, the film was nearly flawless. There might have been a few technical issues and some slight over-acting from Patrick Stewart, but perhaps I was just nitpicking at the movie. However, the film truly does reach a climax, because the film starts to falter right after its best moments. The pacing starts to drag, and major plot elements slowly become sillier. In the first half, the film felt like a neo-Western that simply included four mutants, as it relied on the various character arcs and interactions instead of “comic book elements” to progress the story forward. With the introduction of a younger Wolverine clone, the increased inclusion of Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant) and his plan involving mutant children, the film started to take a dive back into being a comic book movie. The second half isn’t completely awful; it’s just that the first half had such a perfect balance that it set high expectations for the rest of the film.</p>\n<p>However, because of these expectations, even the smallest falters made the film appear more unbalanced, as the comic book elements became very present. As more characters were introduced, the film started to become overcomplicated. With these sudden inclusions, the film removed some of the realistic, serious undertones that the first half was spent building upon. The biggest strength of the first half was that there was almost a complete lack of superpowers used in a superhero movie. Even then, the mutant powers fit the mood that the film set for itself. But as the film went into the second half, it seemed as if characters and scenes were written into the script just so the film could make other major moments happen. If the screenwriters did a few more tweaks, they could have still gotten to these moments while staying true to the tone they set for the film. The characters established in the first half could easily hold the movie on their own. Those who appeared in the second half could have just been mentioned, and the film would have worked just fine.</p>\n<p>Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre (as most people are suggesting for the film overall). If the film was strong throughout, then it would certainly be “The Dark Knight” of the X-Men franchise. But as it stands now, it is solely a solid comic book film. While Jackman didn’t end his 17-year run as Wolverine on the best note possible, he sure did end on a great one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/","id":5831,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5830,5829,5828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Get Out’ Conveys a Message Within Horror","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think abo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Get Out” served up the most fun that I’ve had at the movies in a very long time. Not only is it an incredibly tense, ridiculously funny and shockingly unnerving film, but it’s also an immersive thrill-ride. While the film is surprisingly impressive, it’s even more jaw-dropping when you consider that “Get Out” is Jordan Peele’s directorial debut. While Peele brings along his knack for humor, don’t be deceived; “Get Out” is intensely thrilling and insanely smart. It’s the rare film that’s a perfect mix of comedy and suspense, all the while remaining an absolute blast.</p>\n<p>When his girlfriend invites him to meet her family, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, decides to go, knowing all too well the inevitable and uncomfortable topic of his skin tone. However, nothing could prepare him for what actually lies at the Armitage homestead. Surrounded by elitist, white, upper-class citizens, African-American servants and heavy doses of passive-aggressive racism, Chris can’t help but feel an overwhelming desire to, well, get out.</p>\n<p>Right out of the gate, “Get Out’’ opens with a perfect start that comfortably situates the audience into the unnerving, chuckled tone of the film. With its simple setup and seemingly basic plot, the film’s modest layout would normally signal a run-of-the-mill slasher film. But, as time passes, its structure and narrative become increasingly layered and complicated, proving that this movie is anything but your usual horror flick. There’s a clear crescendo as the film goes on, a rise that leads to both a maddening insanity and a worthwhile payoff. But this progression and escalation is so well-guided due to its intricate and layered plot that the film succeeds where less intelligent ones would fail. The film’s success lies in the fact that it uses this intelligent design for the purpose of entertainment. While sections of “Get Out” do address deeper and politically sensitive topics, the film never becomes a lecture on political awareness, nor does it ever forget its best quality: its ability to entertain with gripping humor and suspenseful horror.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Peele has absolutely coated and smothered the first half of the film with foreshadowing. Long after you’ve left the theater, these once-hidden details and premonitions will begin to click in your brain, allowing you to uncover aspects of the film you weren’t originally conscious of. This attention to detail makes “Get Out” the kind of movie you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. This technique is mostly found in Peele’s often tongue-in-cheek script. Dialogue is riddled with references and coded words that stand out like a sore thumb. In the paranoid setting, you begin to question even the smallest details. Nearly every line seems to have a hidden meaning, and by the end of the film, the script’s payoff is nearly mind-blowing. It’s jam-packed with so many hidden goodies that it would be nearly impossible to grab everything on the first go. “Get Out” definitely warrants multiple viewings.</p>\n<p>The same attention to detail can be found in the film’s sound design. While the score is a bit lackluster and often falls to the background, the sound design ends up by playing an integral role in both the narrative and the immersive nature of the film. Distinct sounds will begin to stand out and change meaning as the film goes on, playing into both the plot and the characters’ personalities. It sounds a bit complicated, but it works so seamlessly and on so many levels without much effort on behalf of the audience.</p>\n<p>These tricks and techniques transform “Get Out” into some kind of participatory mystery-thriller. It’s like the movie begs the audience to solve its puzzle. All the pieces are there for you to figure it out, you just need to pay attention to the detailed clues. And that’s part of what makes “Get Out” so much fun; its engagement of the audience. However, as much as you try to figure it all out, the film’s shocking twists will surprise even the most careful observer.</p>\n<p>The film also closely follows the protagonist, rarely showing us something that he hasn’t seen himself. It’s in this connection to Chris that the film relays most of its humor and suspense. The most horrifying moments are to be found when the camera lingers on a single shot, refusing to cut away. Like Chris, we are forced to helplessly watch as some terrifying force comes running straight toward us without any breaks. It’s a refreshing step away from the jump-scare. Taking advantage of its incredible sound design, this kind of experience also occurs in the much-advertised hypnosis scene in the film. I won’t give anything away, but I can tell you that it’s been a long time since I’ve felt that uncomfortable while watching a movie. The rhythmic and nerve-wracking sounds force you to experience Chris’s stress almost too well.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_76124\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1227778867\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76122\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76124\" data-attachment-id=\"76124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/film-title-get-out/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1586&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1586\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Film Title: Get Out\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=888%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76124\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2-250x194.jpg?resize=250%2C194\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=768%2C595&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>As a character, Chris’s calm demeanor can sometimes come off as a bit bland. But this reserved performance seems more intentional, displaying his ability to deal with the constant racism that’s thrown his way. He just isn’t fazed by it anymore, and his indifference is quite humorous. It also helps us to identify more with his character, as if we are vicariously experiencing his horror. While the other actors and actresses generally do a good job, there are some definite standouts. Lil Rel Howery, who plays Rod, is by far the comedic showstopper. His insight into the crazy events is hilarious and always brings the tone of the film back to comedy. But when it comes to horror, the scene-stealer here is the unnerving and troubled Georgina, played by Betty Gabriel. Her facial expressions and peeled-back smile are enough to make you shudder. Paired with close-up shots that are too much to look at and line delivery that is absolutely haunting, Georgina is sure to become a contemporary — and someday classic — movie “monster.”</p>\n<p>But as far as monsters go, there is no bigger villain here than racism. While this review won’t go too far into detail, it is worth mentioning how politically relevant most of the film is. As expressed above, the film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think about. Rarely does this become too overbearing, as the microaggression within the film ranges from clever and subtle to overly blatant and straight to uncomfortably hilarious.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most terrifying about Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is that its fictional world is only a small satirical step away from the one we live in. Aside from its relevant social critiques, the film stands foremost as an immensely fun and engaging feature. It’s nearly impossible to find anything wrong with “Get Out,” which explains its incredible success with the critics. I can’t think of a single person who wouldn’t have a fun time seeing this film. While it’s not the be-all-end-all Kubrick masterpiece that some people are claiming, it is, however, likely to be the most fun you will have at the movies for a very long time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/","id":5824,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5823,5822,5821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Directors Honored at SBIFF","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Outstanding Directors Award ceremony was held on Feb. 7, with the Arlington Theatre playing host to such acclaimed filmmakers as Damien Chazelle, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins, Kenneth Lonergan and ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from celebrating the stars in front of the camera, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) also takes the time to praise the artists behind it.

After an eight-year hiatus from filmmaking, he made “Moonlight”, a film about a Miami teen struggling with issues of family and sexuality. Its success made Jenkins the first African-American to earn Oscar nominations for directing, writing, and best picture. It premiered, fittingly enough, at Telluride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was cool as hell,” Jenkins said, grinning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film, he said, had much personal significance to him and the man who wrote the play on which it was based, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both of them had cocaine-addicted mothers, and Naomie Harris plays one in the film. Jenkins had to hold his ears backstage so he wouldn’t hear the clip featuring her, the memories still fresh in his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenneth Lonergan, writer and director of “Manchester by the Sea”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed Jenkins.

It started out as an arbitrary choice, and then I did a lot of research on the town. I think just all the elements of the environment of a story can be really important part of it.  If you think of movies like “The Last Picture Show” or “Hell or High Water,” for instance, and “Moonlight” … you don’t want “Moonlight” to be anywhere but Miami, and it really couldn’t be, in a way. It’s a little hard to say why. I think a place has a personality just like a person does, and once you’ve got that personality into the story, it’s hard to imagine it without it.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s (impressively heart-wrenching) story was the brainchild of John Krasinski and Matt Damon, who dropped out of directing and starring duties. The role of the emotionally detached protagonist Lee Chandler ended up going to Casey Affleck, earning him an Oscar nod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s just incredible,” Lonergan praised him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primarily a writer, Lonergan has been practicing his craft since the fifth grade.

Did those conversations influence how you two cooperated on making “Arrival?”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve: Yeah, definitely. I spent a lot of time, a lot of coffees with Eric in order to develop the screenplay. I mean, it came with a very strong first draft, and my job as a director is to guide the screenwriter, to move forward, to shape the movie to the way I would love it to be. So, yes, definitely. A lot of conversations helped a lot in building the world we were dreaming of. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve, known for directing dramas like “Prisoners” and “Sicario,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said it’s been a long-time ambition to make a sci-fi film, having been influenced by comic books, Steven Spielberg and Alejandro Jodorowsky (who also took a crack at making “Dune,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which Villeneuve is signed on to direct). The problem with modern sci-fi films, Villeneuve said, is that they have a “lack of freshness” on account of being more about the technology than the ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “Arrival”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself, Villeneuve said, “Amy [Adams] was my muse.  She was my first choice,” and, “For me, the movie was about this woman’s journey and her revelation about death.” One thing he tried very hard to avoid was crafting the film in a way that information would be spoon-fed to the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening capped off with (as is SBIFF tradition) all five directors taking the stage to discuss their early cinematic influences with Hammond, with answers ranging from “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Disney</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then “Risky Business”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">director Paul Brickman took the stage to praise his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were two common threads [of tonight’s films]: a strong emotional center and, in this corporate world of ours, these were fiercely personal visions. It gives me a lot of hope,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noting that members of the Directors Guild of America had considerably short lifespans, he quipped, “Let’s get these awards out while they’re still healthy,” and the five thus received their very pointy gold trophies from volunteers before standing up for a final round of photos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/","id":5830,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5829,5828,5827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF’s Virtuosos Awards Celebrate Diversity","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/virtuosos-500x333.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/virtuosos-500x333.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1","description":"This year’s Virtuosos Awards ensemble dared to defy the divisions that are often employed within Hollywood and created compelling performances that enticed audiences across countless screens. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Virtuosos Award ceremony was held in the Arlington Theatre on Feb. 6 at the height of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The eight honorees of the night included Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”), Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Janelle Monáe (“Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures”), Ruth Negga (“Loving”), Stephen Henderson (“Fences”), Simon Helberg (“Florence Foster Jenkins”),  Aaron Taylor-Johnson (“Nocturnal Animals”) and Dev Patel (“Lion”). The Virtuoso Award is a recognition for the breakthrough actors who gave a riveting performance in a film released the previous year.</p>\n<p>The moderator of the night, Dave Karger, acknowledged that six of the actors given the award were people of color (Patel, Henderson, Harris, Ali, Negga and Monae). Despite sentiments of despair that can arise when considering diversity in today’s landscape, the world of film has begun widening its spectrum of inclusion. All of the actors honored with a Virtuosos Award this year brought three-dimensional characters to life with storylines that didn’t submit them into clichéd molds.</p>\n<p>Mahershala Ali was the first recipient of the night, receiving the award for his utterly breathtaking role as Juan, a drug dealer in “Moonlight.” Karger spoke of Ali’s ability to channel dynamic vulnerability into a man who dealt with drugs. Ali drew from personal experiences about the region where he grew up, pointing out that most drug dealers in the area did not embody their exaggerated stereotypes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Most of them never grew up wanting to be drug dealers; they did it because that was the only way they could survive,” Ali said. In regard to the condemnation of his religion in the media, Ali eloquently stated, “The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, but the vast majority of media coverage of Muslims is of those who are not.”</p>\n<p>When given the question if he would ever want to pursue making romantic films, Ali responded with “I want to do everything. I want to tell a joke or two, as well. I want to do a comedy or action movie. I’ve done a lot of television, but for now I want to explore more theater and film.”</p>\n<p>As for Ali’s “Moonlight” costar, Naomie Harris, she was hesitant in taking on the role of the drug-addicted Paula, as she thought it would only perpetuate negative stigmas, but ultimately decided to take on the role when she saw the vivid complexities and earnest nature in director Barry Jenkins’s script. Harris is the only actor in “Moonlight” that appears in all three chapters, and the astounding element is that she filmed all of her scenes in just three days. She had to deal with portraying a woman who descends into a desperation of drug dependency. To prepare for the role, Harris had to venture into the depths of YouTube to research drug addicts, as she herself doesn’t consume caffeine, alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p>With the vast collection of serious roles in these movies, Simon Helberg’s role in “Florence Foster Jenkins” alongside Meryl Streep sheds a comedic light on this year’s Virtuosos Awards.</p>\n<p>When the clip of his performance from “Florence Foster Jenkins” was displayed on screen, the crowd was erupting into fits of laughter when they witnessed Helberg’s facial expressions in the scene reacting to Streep’s singing. Helberg had to undergo preparation to freshen up his piano skills to further delve into the role of the pianist, Cosmé McMoon.</p>\n<p>When asked about what it was like working alongside Streep, Helberg said it was “much like a fever dream” and made a knock at the recent comments made about Streep from the President, joking, “She’s very powerful, if not overrated.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Henderson is a newcomer in the framework of film yet a seasoned veteran in the theater component of acting. Henderson played the same role he plays in Denzel Washington’s film adaptation of the August Wilson screenplay, “Fences,” on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p>On his lifelong dream of working with Washington, Henderson mused, “If you wait for the train, it’s always going to come to the station.”</p>\n<p>As a surprise to the audience, Janelle Monáe stated that she actually studied drama in college before dedicating her time to music. Her role as Juan’s girlfriend, Teresa, in “Moonlight” marked her film debut and catapulted her into the realms of the Golden Globes and the Oscars.</p>\n<p>Regarding her role, Monáe said, “I wanted to fill a void for the character of Chiron that his mother couldn’t fill because she wasn’t capable due to her drug addiction. It was a reminder to him that he does matter and that he shouldn’t ever think for a moment that he was not worthy of love.”</p>\n<p>Ruth Negga, an Ethiopian-Irish actress, was being presented the Virtuosos Award for her performance in “Loving,” a story of an interracial marriage during the time of segregation. She finalized her interview with Karger about her Oscar-nominated portrayal as Mildred Loving with the compelling message that, “This isn’t just a black story, and it isn’t just an American story.” She added, “It’s my story, and it’s the world’s story.”</p>\n<p>Dev Patel has the charismatic qualities of a Disney prince, and his phenomenal role as Saroo in “Lion” only adds to his charm.</p>\n<p>Patel’s first scene when filming “Lion” was the ending reunion scene, and he expressed that he “spent eight months of sleepless nights on thinking about making this scene perfect.” Patel recounts his portrayal as Saroo as a “process of introspection; I spent a lot of time isolated, traveling on trains in India. I had to write a diary, which I’ve never done before; that makes you confront somethings inside yourself.”</p>\n<p>As the last actor to accept an award, Aaron Taylor-Johnson talked about his sadistic portrayal of the killer Ray in “Nocturnal Animals.” Johnson showed hesitance of taking on this role as he felt it would bring an excessively dark aura into his household, where he is surrounded by his daughters and wife. Due to the gruesome nature of his character, Johnson had to do exhaustive research on serial killers three months prior to the making of the film. While on this intensive diet of serial killer documentaries, Johnson learned that what he had to emulate from these killers into his inherently violent character, Ray, was their dimensions of “charm and charisma.”<br>\nIn regard to starting the production of “Nocturnal Animals,” Johnson said, “I started to have sleepless nights, both from the things I was watching and the anxiety that came from provoking Jake Gyllenhaal’s character.”</p>\n<p>Karger wrapped up the night by asking a final open-ended question to the panel of actors: “What are three dreams that you want to fulfill?” Negga stated that she wants to work with the influential director Spike Lee; Ali would like to someday portray Jack Johnson or the Motown singer-songwriter Marvin Gaye; Monae would like a legacy “Star Wars” movie and to see more predominantly female and minorities in film; Taylor-Johnson would love to work in another one of his wife’s films. This year’s Virtuosos Awards ensemble dared to defy the divisions that are often employed within Hollywood and created compelling performances that enticed audiences across countless screens.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/","id":5823,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5822,5821,5820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Moonlit Evening with the Stars of ‘La La Land’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.

Hundreds of fans screaming in unison heralded their arrival at the Arlington Theatre as they stepped out of their midnight-black cars. The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.</p>\n<p>After the picture-palace had filled every seat, Board President Lynda Weinman emerged to thank the show’s sponsors and drew attention to how SBIFF is, unlike many other festivals, primarily educational. Then she introduced the show’s veteran moderator for the evening, Roger Durling, who hailed the night’s guests as “intelligent and amiable” and “an average-looking sex-symbol.” Whomever he was referring to is up to you.</p>\n<p>Then the lights dimmed and a montage of the two performers’ roles played onscreen to the tune of the film’s opening song, “Another Day of Sun,” played live on a century-old organ. After it sank beneath the floor, Gosling and Stone walked onstage to a standing ovation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It did not take either of them long to charm the already won-over audience, with a stoic Gosling dryly noting that the photographers camping out in front of the stage were shooting his every twitch. Stone, meanwhile, jokingly referred to Gosling as “Rysies” and announced her goal to make Durling snort as much as possible for the night’s duration. If only she could hear the man in the audience whose laughs sounded like a duck’s mating call.</p>\n<p>Their careers were reviewed through clips and Durling’s commentary: Gosling rose to dramatic prominence as a Jewish Nazi in Henry Bean’s “The Believer,” despite Bean’s skepticism over the role going to a “Mickey Mouse Club” alumnus. Stone dropped out of high school at 15 to act and, like her “La La Land” character, spent months auditioning without success. She eventually came to win the hearts of her fans in “Superbad” and “Zombieland.”The two first appeared alongside each other in “Crazy, Stupid, Love” and established a rapport after improvising together during their audition.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75548\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"465873950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75543\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75548\" data-attachment-id=\"75548\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/la-la-land-by-jenny-luo-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"La La Land by Jenny Luo-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75548 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gosling wound up getting involved with “La La Land” when he recognized Chazelle in a restaurant and approached him.

Gosling stares, almost forlornly, at the floor.</p>\n<p>“You too, Ryan!” Both actors burst out laughing with the crowd.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Chazelle came onstage to mark the night’s end. As dozens of flashing camera lights attempted to blind him, he told his stars, “I do believe you two are some of the best actors working today,” and he called their participation in his film “a dream [he thought] would never come true.”</p>\n<p>Gosling and Stone happily accepted their awards, then used the rapier-like ends of the golden statues to duel onstage.  “You could do some real damage with this,” Gosling joked.</p>\n<p>After the show, they exited through the back of the Arlington into awaiting long, black, glamorous Chevrolets. Fans eager to get a closer glimpse or even a photo stood behind metal barriers being carefully monitored by security guards. Gosling emerged to renewed squeals with Stone following right behind. After taking a brief minute to interact with their belated fans, they left in their dark chariots to (most likely) return to the sun-kissed lands of La La.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/","id":5821,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5820,5819,5818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hitchcock Channeled Through Music’s Rhythmic Ghost","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Blackmail” is the perfect film for which Michael Mortilla to compose to. Its challenges in balance, from tone to pace, keep Mortilla’s ever changing melody on its toes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As part of The Carsey-Wolf Center’s 2017 winter events, “Expanded Hitchcock” is a new series that explores the work of director Alfred Hitchcock, whose influence and career spanned over six decades. Each classic film will be examined in a new light with the help of guest speakers, including film scholars, industry experts and “The Birds” actress Tippi Hedren.</p>\n<p>The Expanded Hitchcock series began with 1929’s “Blackmail,” a British thriller that was released in both silent and sound versions. As Britain’s first sound film, it was, and still is, heavily praised for its groundbreaking accomplishments. However, the silent version seems greatly preferred in the critic’s eye. Despite Hitchcock’s surprising early control and mastery of sound technique, critics often point to the silent version as the stronger of the two. One such critic happens to be guest Michael Mortilla, an incredibly talented and highly sought after freelance composer, who provided an original, live piano accompaniment for the rarely seen silent version of Hitchcock’s “Blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Mortilla’s resume is remarkably impressive. From composing for the 1996 Olympic Games to his multiple commissions from the Library of Congress, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the National Film Preservation Foundation, it’s easy to see Mortilla’s wide reach and influence in the art of sound design. However, one of his most impressive feats has to be his recent work at the New Objectivity exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in January of last year. Mortilla played for more than eight hours straight, providing accompaniment to four lengthy films. While this would be impressive on its own, there is one thing that separates Mortilla from most modern day composers: everything he composes is completely improvised, including Thursday night’s performance of “Blackmail.” That, and the fact that he didn’t leave that eight-hour LACMA performance even once to use the restroom, is perhaps the most remarkable thing about Michael Mortilla.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As much as the night was an exploration of the rarely seen silent version of “Blackmail,” it was equally a celebration of the wonderful creativity of Mortilla. Moderator Charles Wolfe, a professor of the Film &amp; Media Studies Department at UCSB, began the post-screening interview by asking Mortilla how he prepared and executed his performance with such precision without the aid of a score or sheet music. After jokingly refusing to answer Wolfe’s question, Mortilla began to explain his technique.</p>\n<p>He begins his rehearsals by improvising through an entire screening of whatever film he is to perform to. This can include anywhere from seven dry runs to none at all. This time, however, he “practiced his ass off.” He typically continues to improvise until “something sticks,” at which point he begins to solidify a general outline of his upcoming performance. For “Blackmail,” he knew he was ready when he was able to play his entire piece without the help of the film, relying entirely on his memory.</p>\n<p>While he doesn’t have a score, Mortilla does have a general feeling as to what the film should sound like. “The screen is my palette,” said Mortilla, beginning to explain the ways in which he concentrates his improvisation on a diegetic grounding. His overall goal is to “create an actual atmosphere that the people actually live in,” and so his improvisation is mostly inspired by the story and themes of the films themselves. This focus on a narrative theme and feeling helps keep Mortilla on track and ties his improvisation together within the confines of the film. For “Blackmail,” the result is a tense and percussive theme that reinforces the film’s stressful, noir tone. In fact, it was Hitchcock’s often complicated and layered tone that influenced much of Mortilla’s own score for “Blackmail.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75261\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1234001996\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75260\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75261\" data-attachment-id=\"75261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/blackmail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=2048%2C1436&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1436\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"blackmail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=888%2C623&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75261 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail-250x175.jpg?resize=250%2C175\" width=\"250\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=768%2C539&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p>With a penchant for dark humor and irony, Hitchcock often complicates the lines between a suspenseful thriller and a tongue-in-cheek comedy. Mortilla had to address this dichotomy, deciding his score had to “keep an emotional content void.” With so many layers of emotion and underscores of ironic impending tragedy behind nearly every scene, the score could not be entirely happy nor entirely sad. In the end, the score had to arrive at a neutral energy level, with the occasional spike and suspenseful build up.</p>\n<p>Mortilla had to consider the same balancing technique when it came to Hitchcock’s peculiar pacing of the film. “The pacing changes in a snap second,” answered Mortilla, when asked how his score was influenced by Hitchcock’s use of motion. With both the camera and actor moving and stopping so frequently in “Blackmail,” Mortilla had to be ready to stop at a moment’s notice. However, this is one of the many things Mortilla loves about Hitchcock: the way “he suspends time, (and) forces us to go slow,” as if the director himself was telling Mortilla to stop. And that is exactly what Mortilla does.</p>\n<p>When he goes to see other live accompanists, he ends up wanting “to run out of the theatre screaming.” His frustration stems from seeing the other silent film accompanists playing for themselves and showcasing their own talent, instead of sitting down and playing what would be best for the film. According to Mortilla, there is only a “pocket” of four or five composers who play to the film in the same manner as he does. Mortilla believes what many of the musicians lack is a proper background in movement, as most of them aren’t rooted in genres associated with dance. Mortilla, however, is no stranger to movement and dance. In addition to his previous work as the former resident composer for UCSB’s Theater and Dance department, Mortilla also worked very closely with Martha Graham — the mother of modern dance — composing and playing for her and her dance troupe across the nation for a variety of events.</p>\n<p>For Mortilla, improvisation is all dance, and it’s no doubt one of the reasons he finds a love for Hitchcock. “Blackmail” is the perfect film for which Michael Mortilla to compose to. Its challenges in balance, from tone to pace, keep Mortilla’s ever changing melody on its toes. Each key is pressed for the sake of the film. In his own words, it’s as if a “ghost is in my fingers, making rhythms for me.”</p>\n<p>For the next installement of the Expanded Hitchcock series, or for other Carsey-Wolf Center screenings, go online to <em>carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75260\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75260\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/","id":5820,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5819,5818,5817],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"5 Movies That You May Have Missed in 2016","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Matt-Ryan-Tobin-The-Witch-Movie-Poster-2016-Hero-Complex-Gallery.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Matt-Ryan-Tobin-The-Witch-Movie-Poster-2016-Hero-Complex-Gallery.jpg?resize=980%2C529&ssl=1","description":"With the year finally over and Oscar season quickly approaching, it’s important to take a look back at some of the great films Artsweek didn’t have a chance to review, or films you maybe didn’t ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the year finally over and Oscar season quickly approaching, it’s important to take a look back at some of the great films Artsweek didn’t have a chance to review, or films you maybe didn’t have the time to see.

After stumbling upon a gruesome murder scene, the group is forced to take shelter in the venue’s green room, while the owner and his ruthless gang try to cover up their tracks by murdering the witnesses.</p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of Saulnier’s previous work, “Blue Ruin,” then you’re going to be right at home. For any fan of the late Anton Yelchin, who tragically passed away earlier this year, a great performance of his is to be found among the superficial action and blood. It’s one of the most shocking, grotesque and fun movies of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>“Manchester by the Sea”</strong></p>\n<p>For what is probably the most well-known out of this list, “Manchester by the Sea” is an overwhelmingly critically acclaimed drama about an emotionally absent janitor (played by Casey Affleck), who distances himself from the world. When a new tragedy strikes, Lee (Affleck) is called to reconnect with what is left of his family, forcing him to face the hidden trauma he had hoped to keep submerged.</p>\n<p>Solidified by its strong performances and grounded in reality with its nuanced script, “Manchester by the Sea” is remarkably similar to this year’s “Moonlight.” It’s a story that has drama, heartbreak and tragedy, but it treats its subject matter with such respect and consideration that the emotional dilemmas are never presented as something done just to tug at the heartstrings. Instead, the film’s focus is on the effect of trauma rather than the dramatic trauma itself. Affleck’s Golden Globe-winning performance is so real and reserved it’s hard to find a moment in which he seems to be acting. It’s filled with a hidden pain that is difficult to watch at times.</p>\n<p>It’s an incredibly human piece that seamlessly weaves between deep depressions and warm hilarity. With by far the greatest male performance of the year and with incredible polish by writer and director Kenneth Lonergan, it is guaranteed to be a favorite in the Oscar season.</p>\n<p><strong>“The Light Between Oceans”</strong></p>\n<p>With what could perhaps be considered as the antithesis to “Manchester By the Sea,” especially with its lackluster critical reception, “The Light Between Oceans” is at times melodramatic, self-indulgent and even, dare I say, cliché. But it’s all so expertly pulled off by director Derek Cianfrance (“Blue Valentine”) that it’s easy to let go of these reservations and enjoy what is a beautiful and classically crafted film.</p>\n<p>The plot follows WWI veteran Tom (Michael Fassbender) and his new wife Isabel (Alicia Vikander) as they struggle with their new life as operators of a lighthouse on a secluded island. After the couple runs into difficulty trying to conceive a child, their prayers are seemingly answered. What at first seems like a miracle quickly turns into an ethical and moral dilemma that simultaneously heals and destroys their relationship and humanity.</p>\n<p>With remarkable performances, a period piece setting that seems to be written by Jane Austen herself, and a low-stakes melodramatic tone, the film wears its desire to be a classic drama on its sleeve. At times this drive brings out the worst in the film, with gimmicky setups and predictable plot points, but it by no means diminishes the craft and engrossing nature of the film.<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movie1-e1484807315605.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"879313952\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74969\"><br>\n</a></p>\n<p><strong>“The Witch”</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Eggers’s “The Witch” is such a masterfully crafted horror picture Kubrick that himself is somewhere smiling. It oozes dread at every corner, with such a demanding atmosphere that you’d be a sadist if you still felt comfortable five minutes in. It’s shocking how controlled and beautifully polished Eggers manages to present his feature debut. Each scene is gorgeously terrifying, and every story beat is as equally unnerving as the one that came before. Alongside its perfected tone comes a cast of convincing thespians, delivering historically dense and rich lines with such conviction and natural effort you begin to believe it’s all really happening before your eyes.</p>\n<p>The film follows a religious colonial family as they move to the outskirts of a forest. As they begin to experience satanic disturbances, the family’s religious conviction and dedication wavers, unraveling their familial bonds and dragging into question whether satanic force or religious prudence is the cause of their waking nightmare.</p>\n<p>It’s original, terrifying and by far the best horror movie since “The Babadook.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The Lobster”</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most original film of 2016, director Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Lobster” distinguishes itself as one of the most uniquely disorienting films of the last decade. With cold, blunt surrealist humor, “The Lobster” twists our typical societal conventions of romance and love into cruel, calculated and methodical dictations.</p>\n<p>A group of hopeless, lonely singles are checked into a hotel with a 45-day limit to find a companion of their choosing before they are horrifically transformed into the animal of their choosing. The deadpan, mundane insanity escalates a charming setup into a very real metaphorical nightmare. We watch as prospective lovers violently hunt hotel escapees, sadistically lie to seduce each other, and subdue their human instincts in gruesome ways, all in the pursuit of “true love” and happiness.</p>\n<p>With a unique and outstanding performance from each of its cast members, “The Lobster” is comedically brilliant, absurdly confusing and the most refreshing film of 2016.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/","id":5819,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5818,5817,5816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Arrival’ Makes a Smooth Landing at Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600&ssl=1","description":"'Arrival' stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Carsey-Wolf center kicked off their winter season on Tuesday with a Script To Screen event featuring recent first contact thriller “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a critical and box office success.

Heisserer spoke on the “hat trick” that Chiang’s story hit him with, where he felt “just gutted and tearful and a little joyous at the same time,” wondering “how can I inflict a wide audience with this?”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the alien and international tensions presented, the emotional core of the story lies in the doomed relationship between Louise and her daughter, revealed in scenes that appear to be flashbacks at the film’s prologue and throughout its story, but take on a new light at its conclusion. “The first five pages and the last five pages stayed the same” throughout the writing process, Heisserer said, pointing repeatedly to the centrality of this tragic relationship as the movie’s rhetorical and emotional heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this cathartic punch included aging down Louise’s daughter Hannah, who dies in the film from disease rather than the youthful recklessness of the original story. But Heiserrer noted how this decision was a matter of production as well as emotion: because of the reveal that (and once more, major spoilers follow) Louise’s flashbacks are in fact flashforwards due to the Tralfamadorian nonlinear perception of time imparted by learning the language of the heptapods, they would’ve had to age Amy Adams up, disrupting their own reveal had they let her daughter make it a little longer. “That blows everything,” Heisserer observes, going on to comment on the nature of her character’s temporally-questionable decision to have a child who she knows will die young that “it may be deterministic but we’re unaware of that, we still feel like we have choice.” He finds this paradox of determinism and free will makes Louise’s decision to raise her doomed daughter even more emotionally profound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the tricky way the script plays with time and audience assumptions, Adams’ opportunities for subtlety in her portrayal of Louise were numerous. Heisserer cherished her skill, attesting, “when you have a phenomenal actor that embodies a role for you, you find out just how little dialogue at places you actually need.” This plays out in subsequent viewings for those who’ve already learned the truths of heptapod thinking, and even Heisserer commented, “I certainly still find myself discovering things in Amy Adam’s performance that I didn’t catch in earlier screenings.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74817\" style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"849367051\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74817\" data-attachment-id=\"74817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/arrivalposter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"384,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"arrivalposter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74817 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600\" alt=\"Courtesy of Pollock Theater\" width=\"384\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?w=384&amp;ssl=1 384w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another change Heisserer made during adaptation included increasing the military presence for dramatic tension’s sake, and along those same lines, the actual arrival of the seven-legged, hand-squid hybrid heptapods, themselves. Heisserer spoke of how in Chiang’s story the heptapods contact humanity via Skype-like technology, but how there’s “no tension at all there;” “what does that do geopolitically,” he asks, when the aliens arrive at our front door?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The writer spoke about changes he made during his own process as well. For a long while, the “gift” the heptapods intend to endow humanity with comprised not of their language and its time-transcendent influence, but of “different pieces of technology to make a ship so that we could… venture off and explore the stars on our own… and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interstellar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came out.” Aside from not wanting to hijack another film’s motif, Heisserer and director Denis Villeneuve didn’t want to leave their audiences with the impression that humanity had screwed up irrevocably; indeed, they opted instead to champion human cooperation and unity, reinforced by the circular, complexly interrelated nature of the alien language that fosters it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ryan, joking about being unable to place graphics in scriptwriting software Final Cut, asked about the presentation of the logograms of the heptapod language on paper, Heisserer mentioned being wary of getting too novelistic in his descriptions about them. Spurred by a suggestion from his wife, he left spaces in the script and inserted the graphics manually. “I did that a hundred times,” he remarked, “I’m an idiot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heiserrer described working with Villeneuve as “phenomenal.” In his previous experience, handing a script to a director “feels more like, sort of a hostage tradeoff on a bridge.” Imitating one of these past directors, he joked “maybe I’ll remember your name at the premier.” But Villeneuve was different. Heisserer described the long courtship period before the director attached himself to the project, where they would sit at coffee shops discussing philosophy, science, and religion. After five or six of these intellectual dates, he received a call from his new friend; imitating the director’s French-Canadian accent, he recounts the conversation that made the movie happen: “Ok Eric, now we are married.” The amount of care Villeneuve poured into the project really impressed Heisserer, citing him as the only director to give him calls to check the soundness of any changes he planned on making. This care carried throughout their Montreal crew. According to the writer, even the gaffers and grips read his script, creating a productive environment where “we were all trying to make the same movie.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This crew unity was appropriate then, as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things. The details Heisserer shared with the intrigued audience Tuesday night elucidated this and more, proving a revelatory experience in line with a course of Heptapod 101.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the rest of this season’s upcoming Carsey-Wolf events, including more Script to Screens and a 35mm film Hitchcock series, at <a href=\"http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock\">http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock</a>.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/","id":5815,"author":{"id":703,"name":"Frankie Horne"},"related":[5814,5813,5812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘La La Land’: A Hollywood Story Turned to Cinematic Gold","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14141565_576769935842944_1998357375766171876_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14141565_576769935842944_1998357375766171876_n.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Los Angeles is essentially its own living and breathing character, leading the audience to believe that the film is as extravagant as the city itself. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although director Damien Chazelle has only recently started his film career with 2014’s “Whiplash”, he has already began creating an impressive streak of great films. His latest feat, “La La Land”, focuses on aspiring musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone), two lovers hoping to achieve their dreams in the lively city of Los Angeles. As soon as the words “La La Land” flash onto the screen, the audience is immersed into modern Los Angeles as seen through the lens of old Hollywood.</span></p>\n<p>Because of its focus on Los Angeles life, Chazelle uses very distinct and contrasting colors in every frame to reflect the exaggerated Hollywood productions. Every color, even the most bleak, shine brightly on the screen. Sometimes, the scenes are constructed to look as artistic as possible. As Mia and Sebastian dance in the Griffith Observatory, they are silhouettes dancing gracefully in the stars, capturing the most dazzling moment in their relationship.In another scene, Mia and Sebastian run in from outside, with a beautiful painting serving as its entire background. Los Angeles is essentially its own living and breathing character, leading the audience to believe that the film is as extravagant as the city itself. However, this exaggerated style is layered over a realistic story.</p>\n<p>There is a clear distinction between the romanticized life and the moment when reality starts to settle in for Mia and Sebastian. Whereas most films would put the characters in a situation where they would obviously reunite, “La La Land” questions Mia and Sebastian’s dreams. It asks how many opportunities Sebastian is willing to take even if the results are not entirely what he hoped for, as he would obtain merely fragments of his dream. Mia faces a separate problem, with her career testing her to see how much she truly wants to reach her dream. But surprisingly, the film does not handle this problem melodramatically, as both characters are satisfied with where they are in respect to one another, despite differences in their amount of fame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This story and the themes are represented by the truly unforgettable songs in this film. Most of them sound like they are taken from an old Hollywood movie, as their instrumentals thump with the heart of jazz music. The dance numbers are very reminiscent of this style, while still integrating dance moves that are more modern. As the story progresses, the songs shift from loud and vibrant to subdued and personal. They both serve as a reflection of a certain point Mia and Sebastian’s relationship, and set the tone for the movie. Even though “City of Stars” has won “Best Song” in most award shows, any song nominated could likely win the award. The unique character given to the songs is also in the score, which is used to create emotion so well that it could easily be confused music not intended for a film soundtrack.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite having only made one film prior, it can’t be too early to predict that Chazelle has potentially found his niche in music movies. This niche has proved successful for him, as “La La Land” took home all 7 Golden Globes it was nominated for, breaking the record for number of Golden Globes a single film has received. Indeed, while the niche of music movies may seem more contained than most reputations, Chazelle has nevertheless shown that he can take different angles on this niche based off his two films. While “Whiplash” was an intense drama about music, “La La Land” is a dazzling modern musical influenced by the large Hollywood productions of the past. With the overly exaggerated, yet impressive, choreography and understated character moments, it would not be surprising if this film was adapted into a Broadway production. Already, “La La Land” is basically demanding to be performed in theater. While “Whiplash” brutally pushed a character to his limits in a near impeccable story, “La La Land” pulls at your emotions to create a wonderful experience.</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_74812\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"470211523\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74809\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74812\" data-attachment-id=\"74812\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/golden-globe-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=1800%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"golden-globe-graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74812 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic-1024x512.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"Grace Clark / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74812\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grace Clark / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74809\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74809\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/","id":5838,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5837,5836,5835],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"route":"/categories/artsweek/film-and-tv","highestPage":15}},"__N_SSG":true}
