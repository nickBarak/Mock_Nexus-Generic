Metcalf is the professional face of the group. Responsible for publicity and festival submissions, “she does the talking to people thing,” as Mersel puts it. She’s also the one who got Mersel to apply for the program, and she’s the one who was interested in documentary filmmaking from the get-go.</p>\n<p>“I had an odd inclination into some documentary things, but Blue Horizons solidified that direction,” Metcalf said, her light brown hair tucked behind the ears. “It’s nice to have a channel within the film world.”</p>\n<p>Within the program, the trio worked alongside nine other students in a classroom setting. Three courses were required: one lasting the whole nine weeks, the others lasting six and three. Taught by documentary experts Richard Hutton, Michael Hanrahan and LeeAnne French, the classes were a crash-course in all things environmental science and filmmaking. Guest speakers delivered lectures, and this is how Friedman rolled into the picture.</p>\n<p>“[You knew he was] a cool dude. He was wearing a company t-shirt and his bathing suit, and he was like, look at my Tony Stark drawings of my mussels on the rope,” Mersel said. Just like Ironman, Friedman brought blueprints of his special harvesting techniques to show the class.</p>\n<p>Friedman is the only fisherman in California who uses a mussel fishing technique so sustainable it actually cleans the water. But because very little fishermen have seen this technique in the nation, obtaining permits is difficult, and the difficulty has the potential of wrecking the Mussel Man’s entire livelihood.</p>\n<p>“Organizations are hesitant and want him to do all these studies. So he’s wasting all this money,” Mersel said. The film places Friedman as a character intertwined in a larger issue: the importance of finding sustainable animal protein sources.</p>\n<p>As the film details through its numerous interviews, by 2050 there’s expected to be a massive shortage of animal protein. “We kill animals and put them on trucks — it’s polluting our world,” Metcalf said.</p>\n<p>Within this larger framework, Friedman’s sustainable technique serves as a road map to environmentally-friendly food consumption. And just like that, the trio nailed the conflict and resolution for their narrative story.</p>\n<p>Except it wasn’t that simple. Because of Friedman’s modesty — the man is a literal genius, the only one in California to produce mussels in a clean way, and he’s humble as can be — and because of his reluctance to trash talk permit organizations, the filmmakers had to dive deep to unravel the conflict.</p>\n<p>“We kind of imposed ourselves on his family,” Metcalf said. “Which they were okay with. We definitely spent a lot of time hanging out with them and talking to them and getting him to be comfortable talking to us with the camera. Normal people are not comfortable when you stick a camera in their face.”</p>\n<p>Interviewing turned out to be a lengthy process, and the team shot their last bit of footage three days before the project screened at Pollock Theater. That left less than 72 hours to finish editing.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-hour days are notorious in the world of filmmaking, and students in Blue Horizons are no exception to that rule. For the last 10 days before showtime, most hours were spent in the editing room. “We’d get to the editing room at 9 a.m. and we’d leave at 4 a.m.,” Mersel said, to which Metcalf added. “And then we’d come back in at 8 a.m.”</p>\n<p>But the work paid off, and culminated in an invaluable experience for Metcalf, Mersel, Schmidt, Friedman and the Santa Barbara fishery community. Mersel’s mom, aunt and grandma came to the screening, along with Metcalf’s dad and a whole crew of supportive fishermen.</p>\n<p>Blue Horizons films grow in reputation each year, but “Mussel Man” blew it out of the water. The extended profile documentary was selected for three prestigious film festivals: Santa Barbara International Film Festival, San Francisco Ocean Film Festival and the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing that the documentary was to play at SBIFF, the mussel man responded in a characteristically appropriate way for a man of few words: “Great. I’ll have to bring my pen.”</p>\n<p>To find out more about Blue Horizons, go to <a href=\"http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons\">carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons</a>.

But since Wikipedia is a thing, I am going to go ahead and skip the historical stuff and tell you about my experience at the festival and which movies should be on your radar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sundance: not as exclusive as you’d think…</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before I got to Park City, I expected the festival to be a strictly invitation-only event for industry professionals and their friends and family, completely closed off from the proletariat masses. And while many theaters admitted only industry types with festival passes, getting a ticket for a Sundance movie is really as simple as having three things: 20 bucks, good timing on the ticket page and a way to get to the theater in time to grab a seat. Even locals who were unable to snag tickets participated in the festivities, bundling up to roam around Main Street in search of celebrities to take selfies with.</p>\n<p>Prior to attending, I imagined the awards were carefully deliberated upon by an elite, Academy-style group of old white people behind closed doors. In reality, anyone catching a screening of a competing film was allowed and encouraged to rank it for the Audience Awards competition. I definitely enjoyed turning in my ballots and giving some films their laurels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>… but people still really know their shit</strong></p>\n<p>The crowd at Sundance was a stew of different types of people. But whether film and entertainment was their passion, their job or both, any given Sundancer proved very intellectual about the subject matter at hand.</p>\n<p>This hit me when a guy next to me in a theater mentioned a film he saw at Cannes and, for a second, it didn’t register that he was talking about the French film festival because he didn’t pronounce the “s” because anyone who has been to France knows the French never pronounce the “s” at the end of the word. Most people I sat next to at screenings, stood with in line or schmoozed with at wine &amp; cheese-ers were open and eager to talk about their cool jobs, projects they were working on, the movies they’d loved or hated and why they loved or hated them and, of course, celebrity spottings. Conversation was rarely superficial, and this respectful, reverent mentality created a unique, stimulating atmosphere in Park City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A note on hype</strong></p>\n<p>This heightened atmosphere proved the ideal environment to watch movies in. Many of the films I saw at Sundance were world premieres, so audiences had nothing to go off of when taking their seats except for the cursory synopses on the festival’s website. This seemed absolutely crazy; when was the last time you saw a movie with zero expectations?</p>\n<p>We live in the world of Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB reviews, where we watch trailers before YouTube videos of other trailers, where filmmakers and actors perform variations of the same interview with a billion different coverage outlets, where people tweet stuff like “Interstellar was the most mindblowing thing of my liiiffe” before we get the chance to let “Interstellar” blow our own minds. “Boyhood,” which debuted at the festival last year, was critically acclaimed, but some might argue that the simple slices of life in the film were undeserving of such hype. At Sundance, there isn’t any hype to live up to. The movies speak for themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Also: Global warming is the worst.</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the movies, something I was really excited to experience was falling snow, something I haven’t seen in years. It snowed for a combined total of three minutes during the five days I spent in Park City. While it was definitely cold and there were layers on layers of snow all over the ground and on the slopes surrounding PC, Sundance has been marked by uncharacteristically warm weather for Utah Januaries in recent years. Which sucks. But I digress. In the words of Ari Gold, “You don’t come to Sundance for the snow, you come for the heat,” and the heat was brought in the festival’s strong lineup of films this year. Here’s a rundown of a few of the buzziest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”</strong></p>\n<p>The hilarious and sad story of Greg (“Project X’s” Thomas Mann), a high school senior who reluctantly befriends a classmate with leukemia (the titular Dying Girl, “Ouija’s” Olivia Cooke), “Me and Earl” was greeted with a well-deserved standing ovation at its premier. Strong performances by stars Mann, Cooke and newcomer RJ Cyler (who plays Earl) are backed up by a great supporting cast including Connie Britton (“Friday Night Lights”), Nick Offerman (“Parks and Recreation”) and Molly Shannon (“SNL” and, like, everything else).</p>\n<p>“Me and Earl” gives a refreshing realism to teenagers by treating them like people dealing with complex situations instead of one-dimensional kids. Bolstered by Wes-Anderson-lite cinematography and a score as simultaneously heavy- and light-hearted as the plot is, director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon presents a film that made audiences laugh until they cried and cry until they laughed, earning its Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award in the dramatic competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Z for Zachariah”</strong></p>\n<p>“Z for Zachariah” is a post-apocalyptic love triangle starring Margot Robbie (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Chiwetel Ejiofor (“12 Years a Slave”) and Chris Pine (“Star Trek”) as the last three people on earth. The film spends little time dwelling on the nature of the calamity that ended the world. Instead, it explores the tense, personal story of — to paraphrase director Craig Zobel in a Q&amp;A session — how big the stakes are when the person you’re talking to is quite literally the only person you can talk to.</p>\n<p>An intimate case study, “Zachariah” represents an especially noteworthy turn for Robbie. By balancing the moral greys of the men vying for her affections, she proves that she has many skills in her repertoire disparate from being Leo’s second, hotter wife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Sleeping with Other People”</strong></p>\n<p>Described by director Leslye Headland as “‘When Harry Met Sally’ for assholes,” “Sleeping” is a romcom about Lainey (“Community’s” Allison Brie) and Jake (Jason Sudeikis, “Horrible Bosses”), who lose touch after losing their virginities to each other in college and meet up by chance years later at a sex addiction meeting.</p>\n<p>The movie has big laughs and scenes that could definitely go down in comedy infamy (the term “Dirty DJ” and bottles of green tea might not mean anything together now, but once you see the movie, your mind might begin to wander the next time you’re sipping on an Arizona). Despite its funniness, the film also deals with heartbreak and complex feelings not often included in the romcom package, and while there were times where it lost track of its tone while toeing the line between comedy and drama, I’d say it did its job in delivering both.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“The Witch”</strong></p>\n<p>Displaying an artsiness characteristically absent in horror movies these days, “The Witch” is a dark film about a family with issues. The story is set in a painstakingly researched and recreated 1600s New England homestead on the edge of a foreboding forest harboring, you guessed it, a witch.</p>\n<p>An appropriately haunting score of ghostly wails helps to carry the dark tale as it unwinds. The real scares here don’t jump out at you or stab you in the back; they creep up and come to heads as family members turn against each other when the worst starts to go down. It’s a “Shining”-style psychological terror. While it definitely could’ve been scarier, Robert Eggers deserves his Directing Award in the dramatic category for showing us that horror doesn’t revolve around thoughtless blood-soaked threequels.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/","id":6085,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6084,6083,6082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fifty Shades of Grey: Still a better love story than….actually, not really","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/50-shades-800.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/50-shades-800.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Finally, it’s here.

The mommy-pornographic, masturbatory, former <em>Twilight</em> fanfiction fantasy hit that has taken the sexually-frustrated world by storm: “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the movie.</p>\n<p>Now, to this film’s credit, it is <em>not </em>as bad as the book. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack are fine. All the “inner-goddess” monologues (and all inner monologues in general) are not present, and Christian Grey is not as much of an overt jackass here, but the key phrase is “not as much.” However, saying this movie is not as bad as the book is like saying genital warts are better than herpes. One of them may not burn, but they are both a pain in the ass to have in the first place.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, E.L. James’ <em>Fifty Shades</em> was originally a <em>Twilight</em> fanfic, and it shows. Anastasia Steele is Bella Swan sans the suicidal tendencies, but she still makes just as many stupid decisions and is about as complex as a Rubix cube with only one color. Same goes for Grey, who can be summed up as a kinky dick. While there are some implications of a darker past — like an unhappy childhood and a teenage love affair — these details mainly seem to be there to trick you into thinking Grey is complex, because the film barely elaborates on these histories.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But it doesn’t matter since complexities don’t excuse the fact that E.L. James wants you to sympathize with a man who breaks into his girlfriend’s house to have violent sex with her as a reaction to rejection. In short, there is about as much chemistry between Grey and Steele as air and more air. If this is romance, getting up to go to the toilet is exercise.</p>\n<p>But, hell, you don’t care. You’ve already made up your mind about whether or not you’re going to see this. And if you do, you just want to watch kinky sex. Well, I got news for you: it’s a letdown. Yes, there is sex. But it’s tamer than you’d be led to believe. None of the sex scenes last longer than two minutes, and there are so many cutaways and fast camera movements during the BDSM (which isn’t represented properly, ask anyone who actually practices it), that you’d get more stimulation out of reading the book instead. And if you were hoping to see how well-endowed Jamie Dornan or Dakota Johnson is below the belt, prepare for disappointment. It’s pretty much a lose-lose situation.</p>\n<p>And that’s the key word here: disappointment. Those looking for big budget, hardcore porn will leave dry and limp, and those looking for a decent romantic film should just check whatever’s on Netflix.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung needs better stuff to do on Fridays than go see crap like this.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60953\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60953\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/","id":6067,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6066,6065,6064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"My Not so So Ordinary Eight Days as an Intern","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos15.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos15.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The 2015 Santa Barbara Film Festival came to a close this past Sunday.

With it goes the star sightings, the hip boxed water for pass holders and the influx of visitors to downtown Santa Barbara. But what exactly goes into putting this 12-day shindig together? Does some magical movie elf set it all up? Do they sprinkle some elf magic and “POOF!” celebs appear?? Well, not exactly. This event takes months of planning and really couldn’t be executed without the help of hundreds of volunteers and a couple of smart, quick-thinking and creative interns. Like myself, of course.</p>\n<p>Interning with the festival was a unique experience. Meeting new people, learning how to answer phone calls professionally, running errands and playing Cards Against Humanity were just some of the duties on the job. My first day as a Volunteer Coordination intern was overwhelming but exciting. My thoughts ranged from “I can’t do this, I’m going to ruin everything!” to “OMG I wonder if I’ll meet Jen Aniston?!” Unfortunately, that didn’t actually happen, but I did learn the basics of what I would be doing for the next eight days. I also learned that business casual for one organization definitely doesn’t mean the same for them all. I showed up dressed as professionally (and therefore uncomfortably) as I could only to discover these fancy slacks were too much. All around me, hardworking SBIFF staff wore jeans, cardigans and T-shirts. I would soon figure out that working hard doesn’t always require a suit and tie.</p>\n<p>As the week progressed, I got into a rhythm. 10–11 a.m.: Put dozens of checks next to volunteer names when they have showed up for a shift. 11 a.m.–12:30 p.m.: Run to the Lobero or the Arlington to pick up more sign-in sheets. 12:30 p.m.: Lunch time with my fellow interns. This usually consisted of going to my car and discovering I’d parked in the wrong spot. Two parking tickets later, I would definitely pay closer attention in the days to come</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The rest of my shifts consisted of being in the office and observing my boss, Joe, handle shift cancellations or assisting other volunteers who had questions. Yep, this job wasn’t too intense and not very glamorous so far, but it was a good time. During down time, I learned that Cards Against Humanity is totally ok to play at work, just as long as you’re not reading mildly inappropriate cards too loudly.</p>\n<p>Then just when it seemed like I wouldn’t get to participate in any red carpet events, my help was requested for the Michael Keaton Tribute event, and the following week for the Steve Carell event! As it turns out, tribute events are not so glamorous for staff, interns or volunteers, although they did require a little more than business casual for everyone. Precise coordination and planning was necessary. From what I observed as I helped check-in the press, stress levels peaked on the red carpet nights, but SBIFF staff managed to stay positive. I scored free Starbucks from a festival employee who had no problem with the fact that my broke intern self had zero cash.</p>\n<p>Once the stars were escorted inside the fabulous Arlington Theatre, interns were allowed to take a seat as well. As it turns out, I sat three seats away from Michael Keaton that first night, but failed to notice the award winner at the time because I was too busy staring longingly at his son, Sean Douglas.</p>\n<p>From the switch between office antics and serious business time, interning with the festival is an experience that I won’t soon forget. From a paper airplane contest with my fellow interns to attending fancy events, I think it’s safe to say that there is no intern experience quite like this one. You learn not to take yourself too seriously, to work hard when it’s crunch time and to take a step back and take it all in at the end of the night. While there was no magical movie elf working behind-the-scenes, there was definitely some kind of magic at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/","id":6066,"author":{"id":744,"name":"Brianna Guzman"},"related":[6065,6064,6063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Directors Given Prestigious Honors at SBIFF Chazelle, Linklater, Miller, Poitras and Tyldum Reflect at Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/directors-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/directors-1.jpg?resize=980%2C405&ssl=1","description":"The Outstanding Directors of the Year tribute event was admittedly more low-key than one would imagine.

While there was certainly a long line to get into the Arlington, there weren’t any screaming fans descending upon the historic theater to see the honorees of the night’s event. But what the five tributes lack in mainstream fame, they more than make up for in their creative triumphs.</p>\n<p>Directors Damien Chazelle, Richard Linklater, Bennett Miller, Laura Poitras and Morten Tyldum were all honored Wednesday, Feb. 4 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. After each director answered questions from reporters, took photos on the red carpet and signed autographs for loyal fans, they proceeded inside the theater. One by one, moderator Scott Feinberg introduced the directors through praise and film clips.</p>\n<p>The first director to emerge onstage was Chazelle, writer and director of “Whiplash.” Inspired by Chazelle’s own experiences in high school, the film involves a student attempting to impress a ruthless and abusive band director. Casting the character of Terence Fletcher was a little difficult for Chazelle. He meekly explained to the audience that “I was terrified [of casting J.K. Simmons],” but was quick to praise his acting ability, joking that he seemed to be able to control the veins in his temple. Chazelle also explained his main takeaway: People should not be harmed for the sake of art.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Linklater, who wrote and directed “Boyhood,” came next. Known for his films that deal with the passage of time, the director expressed his pleasure that Austin, Texas is becoming a popular film location. He also explained to Feinberg that, when it comes to stories, “There’s a million in the world; they’re coming at you every day,” and “You need to be deluded in the right way to think you’re the right director for (a film).” He ended off his conversation by telling the audience the now-famous story of how his daughter Lorelei, one of the stars of “Boyhood,” asked him, “Dad, can my character die?” “She was really nice about it,” Linklater said. “She didn’t leave. It helped that she knew she was getting paid. S.A.G. minimum is pretty good teenage wages.”</p>\n<p>Next up was the director of the fascinating “Foxcatcher,” Miller. Beforehand, he talked to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>:</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung: Whose story did you want to emphasize more: Mark Shultz’s or du Pont’s?</p>\n<p>Bennett Miller: It’s really a film about relationships, between individuals, in between classes, in between values. So different parts of the film, it gets weighted on different people. But hopefully, it’s not specifically weighted on one character. It’s spread around.</p>\n<p>AW: How involved were your subjects in the production, like Mark and Dave’s widow?</p>\n<p>BM: They all availed themselves extensively to interviews and research, and they exercised no influence in the decisions in the making of the film, but they really did furnish us with a lot of information.</p>\n<p>Onstage with Feinberg, Miller talked about the odd way in which he was approached to make the film about gold-medalist Mark Shultz and schizophrenic millionaire John du Pont. “About eight years ago, I was in a store, and a stranger approached me with an envelope with newspaper clippings about the story.” That stranger turned out to be Tom Heller, who became an executive producer for “Foxcatcher.” When asked about the scene in which the Shultz brothers (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo) grapple with each other in a bout of wrestling, Miller gave an unexpected reply of “I was thinking about Japanese Zen gardens,” which brought in laughs from the audience.</p>\n<p>After him came Poitras, director of the documentary “Citizenfour,” named after the codename Edward Snowden used to contact her with. She was also interviewed by the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Alex Wehrung: Do you think that Snowden will ever be able to return to the U.S. without being arrested?</p>\n<p>Laura Poitras: I mean, I don’t know. You look at Daniel Ellsberg, [who] was also, you know, indicted under the Espionage Act, and now I think he’s widely recognized as somebody who did something in the public interest. So probably in time, I think it could happen. But [Snowden] might end up in another country temporarily before that.</p>\n<p>AW: What was your ultimate goal in making the documentary? What did you hope to change?</p>\n<p>LP: I’m a filmmaker, so I don’t really make films to change things. I’m not an activist. But as a filmmaker and as an artist, I’m trying to say something. So what I’m trying to say is that … mass, indiscriminate surveillance is a threat and we should know about it. And it’s important that the public should know. So I want to say something about that, and it’s also ultimately a film about individuals and courage and journalism. It’s about the need for adversarial journalism.</p>\n<p>Poitras, who has been to the Middle East dozens of times to film for documentaries like “My Country, My Country,” and “The Oath” told the Arlington audience that since then, she has essentially been blacklisted by the U.S. government as a potential threat and has been detained and interrogated numerous times by border agents whenever she came back to the States. This was the reason why Snowden contacted her, as he knew she was not the kind of person who could be easily intimidated. Nowadays, she is still in contact with Snowden, but not as much anymore.</p>\n<p>The final guest was Norwegian director of “The Imitation Game” Tyldum.  He was able to answer a single question on the red carpet.</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung: Do you believe that your film will inspire those who are still facing discrimination today?</p>\n<p>Morten Tyldum: Oh, I hope so.  I hope also it makes people think twice about prosecuting and discriminating. And that it will get people to accept people who are different from us: different race, different religion, different sexuality. So, if people take that out of the movie, I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>Tyldum, a history buff, explained that he wanted to tell his film as though it were a thriller. He expressed admiration for the film’s star, Benedict Cumberbatch, as well as the man he portrayed, Alan Turing, whom Tyldum called a mystery. “It’s something very relatable to what Alan goes through,” Tyldum said. “With injustice and prejudice, and there’s something so admirable about someone obsessed with an idea. And [the film is] about loneliness, about a man who loses everything. It’s something people really relate to.”</p>\n<p>The director also said something that summed up the lives of all five of these extraordinary people: “I never know what my next project is going to be. You just fall upon it; you fall in love with it, and become obsessed with it.” That love motivated the night’s honorees to make amazing feature films about time, loss, questionable actions, abuse and heroism. Their work is unparalleled, inspirational and motivational. Directors Chazelle, Linklater, Miller, Poitras and Tyldum are all outstanding directors.  <em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would once again like to apologize to Bennett Miller for accidentally calling him Linklater.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/","id":6062,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6061,6060,6059],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Panel Highlights Male-Dominance in Film Industry","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=600%2C419&ssl=1","description":"The phrase “women in show business” conjures a variety of onscreen stereotypes: the distressed damsel, the young clandestine coquette and the sensual temptress, amongst others.

The cause for this can be traced off-screen, where a vast majority of filmmakers and executives are male. The film industry is notoriously difficult to break into, and for an industry that prides itself on progressiveness and liberal values, it is still staggeringly male-dominated in the year 2015. On Feb. 7, six successful women in show business formed the women’s panel at Lobero Theatre and made a dent in this norm, hopefully causing a ripple.</p>\n<p>Bonnie Arnold, Carolyn Blackwood, Kristin Hahn, Rory Kennedy, Aneta Kopacz and Kristina Reed answered questions about their recent films, as well as their careers and what it means to be a female filmmaker and producer. Not only was each woman successful in finding their way in a male-dominated profession, but each panelist told a story of how she enabled the image of a strong female figure either on the screen or in her own life.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a strong female archetype was exemplified in the films of Bonnie Arnold and Carolyn Blackwood, producers of “How to Train Your Dragon 2” and “The Hobbit.” While the “How to Train Your Dragon” book series is devoid of a strong female character, the filmmakers felt it was important to incorporate one into the film. Thus the role of Astrid, a fellow teenage Viking, was born. The role of Galadriel in “The Hobbit” also epitomized a strong female figure. Of Cate Blanchett’s character, Blackwood said, “she kicks a lot of ass” and this was “very, very intentional.” Arnold neatly summed up the need for this type of depictions when she said: “Boys and girls need to see women doing strong things, because if you don’t see it, you can’t even imagine it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kristin Hahn, producer of “Cake,” and Aneta Kopacz, creator of the short film “Joanna” chose to portray women as more realistic heroes in their films. In “Cake,” Jennifer Aniston and her producing partner (and spitting image) consciously decided to center the movie on a woman living with chronic pain, a demographic that is hardly ever portrayed in films. Kopacz tells the story of Joanna, a young mother she read about in an article who was diagnosed with cancer. Kopacz wanted to tell her story, focusing on the bravery and humor exerted in her everyday life with her son, rather than her terminal condition.</p>\n<p>A delightful high point was when Kristina Reed, who worked on the Disney short film “Feast,” a silent animation starring a puppy and a lot of food, went into detail about what goes into making a Disney short. As everything Disney, there are “big stakes and big budgets,” but also a more fun and inclusive attitude surrounding shorts. Everyone in the company, including the security guards and secretary, can pitch their ideas. The winning idea for “Feast” was inspired by an employee who was able to recount his past year through a full account of his 365 dinners using the 1 Second Everyday app. The short meal glimpses were able to tell stories of the year, such as when he was busy on projects and busy with celebratory occasions. Thus the food-based premise of the film was born.</p>\n<p>In contrast to aforementioned indulgent narratives, Rory Kennedy joked that her films range from “depressing to really depressing.” In line with her family’s legacy, she created a documentary recounting the last 24 hours of the Vietnam War. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and left the audience in tears. Kennedy began a career as a reporter, and didn’t think about becoming a filmmaker until she made her first documentary in an effort to expose the untold truth about pregnant women addicted to crack who often cannot find help, in spite of their condition.</p>\n<p>The end segment of the panel consisted of more humorous banter. While discussing the role of male mentors, Hahn chimed that they’re “especially appreciative if you make them look good,” to which Arnold quipped, “I hire that way now.” The cherry on top of the event was a parting gift of postcard sets each donning the countenance of historical women such as Frieda Kahlo and Maya Angelou. While the panel itself was certainly inspiring and uplifting, it would have been nice to see a hint of the racial diversity so prominent in the postcards up onstage.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60860\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60860\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/","id":6065,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6064,6063,6062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“McFarland, USA” Tells the American Story Picking and Running: Disney Film Explores Teenage Life in Central Valley","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kevin Costner plays Coach Jim White in Disney’s “McFarland, USA,” which tells the true story of a coach who inspired his seemingly hapless students to form a cross country team and go the distan...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60759\" style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"562308558\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60867\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60759\" data-attachment-id=\"60759\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/in-photos-30th-annual-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/sbiffinphotos6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=4148%2C2379&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4148,2379\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423338788\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFFinPhotos6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=888%2C509&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60759\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=460%2C265\" alt=\"The cast of  McFarland, USA.

In interviews in a college conference call and on the Santa Barbara International Film Festival red carpet, Costner and White talked to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the film.</p>\n<p>Once known as the “Heartbeat of Agriculture,” McFarland, California is home to fields of cotton, almonds, sugar beets, oranges and grapes. Within this farming town’s predominantly Latino population, many students at the local high school in 1987 did not quite feel that it was home. Neither did their new gym teacher … until he saw how fast they could run.</p>\n<p>The last thing Coach White expected to run into in this little farmland was a group of speedy students. He sought kids who strived to succeed, so he had a tournament and offered the top four runners ice-cold Gatorade, a nicety during a hot Central Valley afternoon. Seeing how quickly they raced, he upped the stakes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I took the top guys in and bought them a milkshake,” White said in a college conference call with the <em>Nexus</em>. “I wanted a little more out of them so I said, ‘If all of you can run a mile in a certain time, I’ll take y’all out to dinner.’ This way, you’re building a team instead of just an individual because they have to encourage each other as a whole.” Upon finding further success, Coach White ran the idea of starting the high school’s first cross country team by the principal, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>To Costner, the sport aspect is merely the backdrop of the story. What made this inspirational was not so much the finish line but the authenticity. This little town in the Central Valley gave distinguished track teams a run for their money and won nine state championships. “It’s a combination of young men and a man with a level of wisdom and desire who come together with one goal in mind and achieve that through hard work,” Costner said.</p>\n<p>White established a cross country empire that dominates the sport to this day, as the pool of talented runners never seems to run dry. The 1987 team reached their stride with pure raw talent — without the gym, fancy equipment or even shoes. The seven runners ran against immense obstacles while working long hours in the fields to make ends meet. To overcome that and succeed shows that they were not run-of-the-mill high school students, a theme that manifests itself during Costner’s inspiring speech towards the end of the film.</p>\n<p>“Coaches have the power to build people up and we can equally tear someone down. So it’s a very delicate thing when you put the life of a young person [in] your hand,” said Costner. “Jim represents the difference an individual can make in a community like McFarland.”</p>\n<p>Besides being a true story, another special part about the film is that it stars three first-time actors from the town McFarland. “I think [Director] Niki Caro did a very interesting thing, casting actors from McFarland. That’s very brave. It also galvanized the community; it galvanized the boys that they were good enough to be there,” Costner said on the red carpet.</p>\n<p>Ramiro Rodriguez, who plays the film’s lovable chubby runner Danny Diaz, is from McFarland.</p>\n<p>“Seeing all the details [of the film] really brought joy to my heart. What you see onscreen is the real McFarland, [where] you see kids picking in the fields and going back to school,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the screening at SBIFF, Rodriguez waltzed down the red carpet, arms around his brothers from the movie, Michael Aguero and Rafael Martinez. All seven runners showed up to the Arlington, along with Costner and Caro. Within the boisterous group, Rodriguez and Aguero were the ones who couldn’t stop smiling.</p>\n<p>“Having us three — having all seven of us in one room, you’re going to have chemistry and chaos — nothing but jokes. We love each other like brothers, we fight each other like brothers,” Martinez said, to which the goofy-smiled Aguero interrupted. “We got competitive — we’d always push each other [onset].”</p>\n<p>Johnny Ortiz, who plays Jose Cardenas in the film, didn’t have the same playful attitude as the others at the red carpet, but gave thoughtful answers to reporters.</p>\n<p>“[The film] shows that Hispanics can play other roles … we can be doctors and lawyers … we don’t always have to be the gangbangers,” he said. At the end of the film, it was revealed that the real-life Cardenas went on to become a journalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is clear that “McFarland, USA” has meant a lot to the little community in the Central Valley.

Steve!” shouted someone way in the back of the Arlington Theatre.</p>\n<p>In one of the front rows, the man of the hour himself shot up in his seat, turned around and yelled, “Hey! Quiet!” in true maniacal Steve Carell form. And just to emphasize how beloved this man is, the rest of the theater exploded into laughs and applause, before moderator Pete Hammond took to the stage to introduce and sing the praises of Carell. Famed for his comedic roles, Carell received the Outstanding Performance of the Year Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival for his portrayal of real-life millionaire and murderer John du Pont.</p>\n<p>A collage of videos set to Redbone’s “Come and Get Your Love” was shown to the audience, tracking Carell’s roles from “Bruce Almighty” to “Foxcatcher.” When asked if his wife of almost 20 years was uncomfortable with the clips showing him being intimate with other women, Carell responded, “No. She knows I have no chance with them.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The dialogue between Carell and Hammond started with a discussion about Carell’s performance in “Foxcatcher,” which earned him an Academy Award nomination. He described the uncertainty surrounding the film’s debut at Cannes: “We had no idea how the movie would resonate with people.”</p>\n<p>The conversation segued into a brief history of Carell’s initial path to success. After attending Denison University (where Carell was a DJ known as “Sapphire Steve Carell”), he worked with Stephen Colbert on “The Dana Carvey Show.” After that, Colbert managed to get him a job as a correspondent on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” by showing co-producer Madeleine Smithberg a skit he was in, “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.” He retained the position for six years before moving on to his acclaimed role as Michael Scott in “The Office.”</p>\n<p>Carell’s first major film role came in the form of television news reporter Evan Baxter in “Bruce Almighty.” In the film, the character is sent into a sputtering mess by Bruce (Jim Carrey), who has godlike powers. Modest man he is, Carell went to see the film with the mindset that his scenes had not made the final cut, when in actuality they did.</p>\n<p>The discussion then switched to “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” (“I lived that life,” said Hammond) specifically the famous chest-waxing scene. According to Carell, his reactions to the painful procedure were mostly authentic, and Romany Malco’s disgust was also quite real. The actress who had done the waxing reportedly had actual experience, but it turned out to be not enough. Before she waxed his nipple, the crew had to stop her as she had not applied any Vaseline. Had she continued, Carell might only have one nipple today.</p>\n<p>What was also very real (to frightening results) was the baboon in “Evan Almighty.” Carell attempted to improvise with the animal that had been trained to take a drink, and told it, “Don’t Bogart it!” The baboon hissed at him in response, and the trainer came over and told Carell, “Don’t look at the baboon. Don’t look it in the eyes.” Carell told the audience what he thought afterwards: “Don’t improvise with a baboon, idiot.”</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in contrast, nothing about “Little Miss Sunshine” was ever improvised. Carell found that experience particularly rewarding, as it gave him a chance to work with Alan Arkin. “I’m one of his biggest fans and supporters,” Carell said. “I really see him as a mentor. He’s an idol of mine.”</p>\n<p>He also took time to praise his other co-stars and friends. He complimented Carrey and Will Ferrell for both being talented, funny men, and Tina Fey for being a fantastic improviser. Some actors took longer to describe.</p>\n<p>“[Woody Allen] scared the shit out of me. I was so in fear of him. He’s a man of few words. I didn’t want to engage him,” Carell said. “I met him briefly in his office, I read the script [for “Melinda and Melinda.” He nodded and said, ‘Good.’”</p>\n<p>Carell revealed an interesting tidbit about Ryan Gosling, stating that one time the “Notebook” actor’s weekend plans to perform at a nursing home with his band. And amusingly enough, on Meryl Streep, Carell said that she’s, “The worst. In print, that won’t read ironically.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the ceremony, the Outstanding Performer of the Year trophy was given to Carell by his co-star of “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,” Jennifer Garner. After praising Carell as an actor and as her friend, she gave him the award and he in turn procured a No. 1 Presenter trophy for her. Ever the comedian, Carell ended his acceptance speech (and the night) with a call-and-response gag: “Thank you for coming,” he said before pointing at the audience, hoping that, as true <em>The Office </em>fans, they would understand.</p>\n<p>“That’s what she said!” came the reply.</p>\n<p><em>Like Steve Carell, Alex Wehrung loves lamp.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60858\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60858\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/","id":5977,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5976,5975,5974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Partners in Crime” Sheds Light on the Truths of the Teenage Psyche","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Chang Jung-chi’s thriller is all about uncovering secrets, discovering lies and exposing the truth.

One would expect as much from a story centered on the sleuthing adventures of high school boys, but Chang takes the concepts even further to delve into the psyche of the teenage character. Layered with betrayal and deception, “Partners in Crime” takes viewers on a psychological ride to shed light on the minds of teens isolated by adults who are unable to understand their struggles.</p>\n<p>When introverted Huang Li-huai (Wu Chien-ho), studious Lin Yong-chuan (Deng Yu-kuai) and resident bad boy Yeh Yi-kai (Cheng Kai-yuan) stumble across the dead body of fellow student Hsia Wei-chiao (Yao Ai-ning), they are sent to the school’s guidance counselor.</p>\n<p>During sessions, the boys bond by discussing the past life and personality of a student they barely knew. They skim through video screenings and pointless, reflective writing assignments. But soon, something ticks inside them. Though they came in for closure, they walked out with quite the contrary: a mission to find the person responsible for Hsia’s so-called suicide. After all, the counselor did say, “If you run into anything unpleasant, you must learn to face it yourself.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Such parting words send a message to both the protagonists and the audience. While they emphasized that Huang, Lin and Yeh couldn’t rely on the police or adults to seek vengeance, the counselor’s words also served as a warning to viewers. Adolescent problems are more than “just a phase” and warrant as much advice and help as adults’. There are no shortcut cures. The counselor’s advice doubles as a promise that there is nothing she can do to help, leaving the boys no choice but to take matters into their own hands.</p>\n<p>The film starts out slow and straightforward: keeping the audience in the loop of the circumstances and the elements of the boys’ scheme (which isn’t much more harmful than a silly prank). But sure enough, viewers are thrown curveball after curveball as plans scatter into disarray and the teenagers are thrust into a rapid downward spiral. The helplessness of the adults in the film is then replicated within the audience: viewers are confused, unaware and even fear for the future of the teenagers, whose screams are unable to reach the adults surrounding them.</p>\n<p>“Partners in Crime” is a suspenseful thriller, not just because of its intricate plot but because it reveals the complex inner workings of the adolescent mind. As the film unveils the truth behind a girl’s death, it also exposes the perplexing thoughts of the teenage character, implying that most thoughts can go unnoticed on the big screen, as well as in reality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/","id":5996,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5995,5994,5993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Novelist Bruce Wagner Opens Film “Maps to the Stars” at SBIFF Spoiler Alert!

Though the trailer makes the film seem like a satire on Hollywood’s demented lifestyle, “Map to the Stars” centers on the twisted story about a family enduring the consequences of their life-long mistake: incest.</p>\n<p>The plot focuses on the return of a schizophrenic named Agatha Weiss (“Alice in Wonderland’s” Mia Wasikowska), the daughter of a powerful tinsel town family, to her home. The Weiss family members include patriarch Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Crusack), “momager” Christina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and child star son, Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird). Agatha’s hiatus from home was due to her stay at a sanatorium, where she went burning down her old house, almost killing her little brother. The incident was caused by Agatha’s early schizophrenia symptoms, which genetically formed from her parents’ incestuous relationship. Stafford and Christina were long-lost siblings who later reunited and fell in love.</p>\n<p>“The movie is about the perversion of the family and the original sin committed by the parents. They had a sexualized, incestuous relationship,” Wagner said in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Supported by copious amounts of medication, Agatha was able to find a job as forgotten actress Havana Segrand’s (Julianne Moore) assistant. Moore’s character had no inhibitions whatsoever. In a particular scene, she is caught sitting on toilet while enduring the pain of constipation. “That scene shows Julianne’s fearlessness. At a certain point, we were having some scheduling issues with her, and we were concerned that we had to go with a different actress, and the actress that we settled on refused, she could not do it,” Wagner shared.</p>\n<p>Chasing a far-fetched role to play her late mother in a film, Segrand was finally able to achieve the sought after role. Unfortunately, her assistant murders her after Segrand was discovered seducing Agatha’s boyfriend Jerome (Robert Pattinson).</p>\n<p>“[Julianne’s] character was fun for me to write because she’s completely uncensored, all of her fears and desperation, which is endemic in Hollywood for actors,” Wagner said. “She talks about her humiliation rather than trying to put on good face. Then later in the movie, when she gets that role she wanted, she becomes a little cooler. Ironically, that’s the moment of her downfall when the bad things happened to her. As a writer, it’s wonderful to write a character where there is no filter.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Agatha convinces her young brother to commit suicide with her so they can finally be free of the pain and suffering that they have endured all their lives. Together, lying on the unsettled land of their old, burned house, Agatha and Benjie swallow doses of pills and close their eyes under the stars. “It was a way for her to close the circle, which she does by suicide, so she couldn’t escape the perversion. But, she certainly escaped the sexualized element of it and she ended it heroically,” Wagner explained.</p>\n<p>Wagner wrote the film’s script 20 years prior to it being made, lending to a challenging process of waiting around. “It was a movie that was hopeless to begin with,” he said. “David [the director] became attached to it, so there was hope, and then that fell apart and another eight or nine years went by, so you would have to be insane to think that this movie would be made.”</p>\n<p>A novelist who focuses on extreme themes from wealth to poverty, fame to anonymity, Wagner has felt disparate responses to his work. “When <em>Dead Stars</em> [Wagner’s novel] came out, the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> full page on the weekend said it was a masterpiece. Two weeks later, the <em>New York Times</em> called it pornography,” Wagner said. “David’s works get similar divisiveness so we have had it all. But, no one is neutral about “Maps to the Stars”; people have either loved it or have a strong reaction against it. There’s no in-between whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>A man who touches on “the poles of the human experience,” Bruce Wagner hopes his new film “Maps to the Stars” will be remembered by his audience. “I hope that people will be entertained because it is an entertainment, and I hope people will be moved in many different ways. The movie stays with you regardless of your reactions, and I hope people laugh; there are funny moments too.”</p>\n<p><em>“Maps to the Stars” </em><em>will be released in select theaters and on VOD on Feb. 27. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/","id":5980,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[5979,5978,5977],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cousteau Family Honored with the Attenborough Award  “Secret Ocean 3D” Grants Cousteau Excellence in Nature Filmmaking Award","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JeanMIchelCosteauSecret-Ocean-3D.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JeanMIchelCosteauSecret-Ocean-3D.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The second day of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival found the Arlington Theatre packed with many eager to meet the legendary Cousteau family.

While most documentaries cast the big fish (whales, sharks, dolphins and the like) as their stars, “Secret Ocean 3D” gives the smaller organisms their chance to shine on the big screen.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Dr. Sylvia Earle, “Secret Ocean 3D” brings the audience up close and personal with some of the world’s most eerie and amazing creatures. Viewers, however, couldn’t appreciate these breathtaking scenes if it weren’t for the new filming tools utilized specifically for this documentary. Now, underwater shots can be made in 3D, Ultra-HD 4K, close up, macro and with motion control. “Secret Ocean 3D” takes full advantage of this technology and it certainly shows through the vibrant colors of the giant clam’s flesh, the smooth movements of the octopus, and the vivid colors of Christmas tree worms dotting the coral reefs.</p>\n<p>Cousteau’s mission, however, is not just to inform. In uncovering the wonders of the ocean, he also hopes to show why humans must be proactive in protecting the ocean. Take plankton, for example. It’s a crucial source of food to many marine animals and produces more than half the Oxygen on Earth. So almost every breath humans take is “a gift from the ocean.” By showing the enormous impact of such tiny organisms, Cousteau demonstrates not just the important role plankton plays in the ocean food chain but also why humans need the ocean as much as the ocean needs them.</p>\n<p>The screening was followed by a panel discussion with the Cousteau family moderated by Tim Matheson. Jean-Michel spoke fondly of his relationship with his father who strapped an Aqua-lung on his back at the age of seven and pushed him overboard into the water. That event soon spurred into family scuba diving in the Mediterranean sea, many adventures on board the ship, <em>Calypso</em>, and of course Jean-Michel’s legacy in ocean exploration. Even after creating countless films and publishing a best-selling autobiography about his father, <em>My Father, My Captain, </em>there’s one thing that continues to keep Jean-Michel excited about his commitment to saving the oceans.</p>\n<p>“Every time I have the opportunity to look in the eyes of a child, I always say ‘I will never let you down because I want you to have the same privilege as I’ve had. And thus we need to do everything we can to protect our life support system and that’s the message I’ve been trying to pass on. Fortunately it has impacted those two there,” said Jean-Michel, gesturing to Celine and Fabien.</p>\n<p>Celine has a different approach in ocean conservation and spoke about her work regarding the indigenous tribes of the Vale do Javari reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, illegal activities and oil exploitation have negatively impacted the tribes and help contribute to their enormous health crisis. But through multi-media content such as film and photography, she hopes to be able to bring awareness to such people and educate others on their changes they can make to better conserve the environment.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s very important to put the human being at the center of every story. That’s how you connect to a wider audience and have them understand their connection to any place, ecosystem, or issue.”</p>\n<p>Fabien, for his part, strives to showcase ocean exploration as an adventure through a project called Mission 31. For 31 days, Fabien and his team lived in an underwater habitat, exploring the ocean at 63 feet below the surface as well as connecting such discoveries with the world.</p>\n<p>“For the first time ever we invited the world to live at the bottom of the sea. We did Skype with classrooms and Google hangouts and were able to share a lot of the discoveries that were happening in real time. It was really important to tell the story in a more immersive way, pun intended, in a way that can have young generations dream.”</p>\n<p>The work of the Cousteau family has expanded over three generations and though Jean-Michel, Celine and Fabien have accomplished much in their lives, there is still work to be done. Pollutants, climate change and overconsumption have negatively impacted our environment but there is still hope. And the first step in making a change is education and awareness.</p>\n<p>“This is our life support system and why we exist,” Jean-Michel said. “If we protect the ocean, we protect ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/","id":5975,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5974,5973,5972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“The Truth About Lies” Delves into Self-Identity","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On one level, “The Truth About Lies” is largely an account of writer and director Phil Allocco’s own life’s misfortunes.

On a deeper level, it delves into the human issue of self-identity. The title itself was enough to pique the interest of enough people to fill the Metro 4 Theater in downtown Santa Barbara. This doesn’t come as a surprise. After all, everyone can be guilty of the inescapable character flaw of lying, even those who don’t consider themselves a “liar.”</p>\n<p>The bright independent comedy follows main character Gilby Smalls, who loses his job, his apartment and his girlfriend all in the same day. To cope, he begins lying his way out of the disheartening situation, and the fabrications ultimately catch up with him.</p>\n<p>In a discussion regarding the nature of lies, I asked Allocco how he came up with the film’s premise. Allocco finds the commonality of the nature of people’s lies interesting. He believes that, rather than being hurtful or malicious, most people lie to make themselves seem more impressive, both to themselves and to others. Thus, he began penning the screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“My only prerequisite was that every character had to either be lying to each other or themselves,” Alloco said.</p>\n<p>After watching the film, I realized that each character really was living their own lie. While Gilby completely fakes his way to landing jobs and women, the secondary characters also lie to distract themselves from a painful reality.</p>\n<p>Allocco implied that lying to oneself can be a crucial step towards self-discovery, a path that the characters struggle with. Even the seemingly happy characters end up facing their own lies. Gilby supports this point when he asserts in the film that “knowing yourself is a luxury.” This begs the question: How many of us really know ourselves?</p>\n<p>The pervasiveness of lying is shown throughout the film with the help of black-and-white onscreen quotes dividing each scene. Each quote derives from noteworthy figures such as Mark Twain or Oscar Wilde, and they pick away at the nature of lying.</p>\n<p>The film takes place in a hip metropolis somewhere in New York and features a certain brand of humor typically found in daytime sitcoms. The plot explodes when everybody who has been lied to by Gilby joins together at an ill-fated dinner party and each character is left to confront the truth.</p>\n<p><em>“The Truth About Lies” will be released in select theaters this month.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60626\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/the-truth-about-lies-delves-into-self-identity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60626\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/the-truth-about-lies-delves-into-self-identity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/the-truth-about-lies-delves-into-self-identity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/the-truth-about-lies-delves-into-self-identity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/the-truth-about-lies-delves-into-self-identity/","id":5979,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[5978,5977,5976],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Documentary “Caffeinated” is Stimulating, Fresh","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/caffeinated2-600x400.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/caffeinated2-600x400.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Ironic story: right before I went to see this documentary, I sat on a State Street bench, catching up on my Gothic literature reading.

However, the project expanded to include people from all around the world, from coffee growers in South America and Africa to European and American caffeine addicts.</p>\n<p>The film takes focus on several subjects, but at the forefront are two groups: entrepreneurs who wish to profit off of coffee by starting their own businesses, and farmers who have difficulty making a decent profit off of their crop.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A fun and introspective look into coffee culture, the documentary relies heavily on interviews. Farmers and businessmen alike showed how coffee affects the lives of people, both socially and economically. An interesting choice by the directors was to not give the film any overlying narration, relying on the interviews to convey which direction the documentary was going to next.</p>\n<p>However, the cuts between interviews did not transition seamlessly, and the sound editing was a bit rough. In a few scenes, white noise pervaded in the background and voiceovers from interviewees seemed to drop out into oblivion upon transitioning to a new location.</p>\n<p>Even so, the interviews were funny and insightful. Coffeemakers showed numerous techniques for creating special blends and making sure their beans are up to high standards, and coffee servers shared their dreams of starting their own businesses.</p>\n<p>Taking on a more serious edge, “Caffeinated” also puts heavy focus on the plights of farmers. Whether it’s politics, weather or decreased demand, coffee farmers often find themselves struggling to sell.

The audience was deeply captivated by what they were seeing. “Confession” is a powerful debut film from South Korean writer and director Do-yun Lee, aided by talented cinematographer Eok Yu. A smart, tense thriller, the movie’s dose of dark humor makes it into a great genre film.</p>\n<p>The film, whose original Korean title literally translates to “Good Friends,” begins by showing the three protagonists, Min-soo, In-chul and Hyun-tae, skipping out on their middle-school graduation to screw around on a mountaintop. When Min-soo falls and gets injured, his friends carry him to safety down the mountain as it begins to snow.</p>\n<p>This scene quickly sets up their personalities: Min-soo is easily manipulated, In-chul is an aggressive, action-taking kind of guy and Hyun-tae is the level-headed one. From the way these three act towards each other, their friendship feels believable.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skip to years later, Hyun-tae is a paramedic married to an ostracized deaf woman, while Min-soo and In-chul lead unsatisfying lives. When Hyun-tae’s mother comes up with a scheme to burn down her illegal casino to get the insurance money, In-chul and Min-soo quickly join in. And everything that can go wrong … well, you already read the top of the article.</p>\n<p>What this reporter admires most about “Confession” is its restraint. The film’s intensity doesn’t require excessive violence or gunfights. While there is some violence, it’s overshadowed by the smart dialogue and character interactions. And there are a lot of interesting personalities that bring flavor: the cool, yet slimy loan shark, wild and angry In-chul, Hyun-tae’s rude mother, emotional Min-soo and, of course, the rational, yet determined Hyun-tae. All these characters are written beautifully and fit well within the movie’s twisted plot.</p>\n<p>If I were to have any complaints, it might be the fact that the subtitles still need another proofread, and the film takes a little too long to end. Still, “Confession” marks an impressive debut feature for Lee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/south-korean-thriller-confession-debuts-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/south-korean-thriller-confession-debuts-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/south-korean-thriller-confession-debuts-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/south-korean-thriller-confession-debuts-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/south-korean-thriller-confession-debuts-at-sbiff/","id":5978,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5977,5976,5975],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“It Starts With the Script” Writer’s Panel  SBIFF Panel Uncovers the Process and Art Behind Screenwriting","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.15.46-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.15.46-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Like most Hollywood professions, the art and business of screenwriting is perplexing.

Career paths don’t necessarily follow the same direction (although the formulaic nature of scripts themselves are debatable). “It Starts With the Script,” a writer’s panel presented by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival hoped to shed some light onto the craft of scriptwriting and the process of using pen, paper and keyboard to project stories onto the big screen.</p>\n<p>Many screenwriters often begin work in different fields (journalism, novel penning, etc.), but quite a few have set their eyes on the movie industry from the get-go. Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) always knew he wanted a career in film and moved to L.A. from New Jersey. The first few years in the business found him writing for hire, doing scripts for low-budget horror and sci-fi movies until he finally found the opportunity to direct his own script.</p>\n<p>“I was hoping to get my foot in the door,” Chazelle said, “and ‘Whiplash’ was my first thing that actually convinced people to let me in. But I think that’s only because I spent a few years in the trenches writing commercial stuff before I convinced people that a jazz movie is actually viable.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jazz was to Chazelle as journalism was to Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). After graduating college, Gilroy started writing in New York as a reporter and reviewer before deciding that writing screenplays (and working at home in his pajamas) was the way to go. But he never let go of his inner news junkie and sure enough, the control rooms of television drew him back and gave him the opportunity to fuse both passions within “Nightcrawler.” As an original screenplay, “Nightcrawler” gave Gilroy full reign to employ his creativity.</p>\n<p>“Like most of us, I do a studio job and I felt increasingly constrained by the small box that you’re allowed to move in,” Gilroy said. “Everything has to be explained, characters needed to be redeemed, and so on. I was in an ornery mood so I wrote a script for myself in which I’d decided to break every narrative rule. But it just turned out that breaking all these conventions connected with the [Nightcrawler] world.”</p>\n<p>Most scripts, however, don’t click as easily. Jason Hall (“American Sniper”) had “this tremendous responsibility and this great burden” to depict the heavy toll of war on the human psyche. Hall traveled to Texas in 2010 to meet Chris Kyle, the film’s real-life protagonist, who had left the military for about nine months. From the look in Kyle’s eyes to the way he fell on his knees to embrace his children, Hall immediately knew that this man had endured and suffered.</p>\n<p>“It’s unnatural for humans to take a life,” explained Hall. “And so, in creating this movie, we sort of did things so that it becomes easier for them to create this character that could take a life. This is a movie about a soldier. This is a story about all soldiers in a way, exploring the archetype of the warrior and what the cost is to the soldier and what the cost is to his family.”</p>\n<p>Hall wasn’t the only writer to adapt a screenplay from someone’s life story. Ever since he finished the ending of Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time, </em>Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”) was hooked. Writing a script about Hawking, however, wasn’t easy. McCarten didn’t want to make a movie using only publicly known facts, but Hawking didn’t allow investigation into his personal life. After reading Jane Hawking’s writing on her relationship with Stephen, McCarten took the initiative to ride a train to Cambridge and immediately declared his ambition to make a movie about her life. Brushing aside Jane’s immediate look of horror, McCarten hoped that if he was charming enough, he could have the signature for the book rights that afternoon. He waited for eight years.</p>\n<p>“The interesting point of the film was that it was about the caregiver as much as it was about the cared,” McCarten said. “They had to break their own theories about what relationships are. They’re two very conservative people, but their situation provides them to be very heroic.”</p>\n<p>For writers like Hall and McCarten, interest in someone’s life story sparked a desire to share it on the big screen. For those like Chazelle, past ambitions helped develop a screenplay with heart. For Graham Moore (“The Imitation Game”), it was both. As a teenager, Moore had a passion for computer science and was a huge Alan Turing fan. In adapting the screenplay, he put Turing’s mathematical genius at the forefront of his character, while simultaneously sparking a debate regarding the portrayal of homosexuals onscreen.</p>\n<p>“He’s a mathematician who happens to be gay, not a gay mathematician,” Moore said. “The movie was never meant to be the last word on Alan Turing; it was meant to be the first word where we wanted people to know his name. His name should be known as well as Newton’s and Darwin’s. But it’s not, because he’s gay and he’s persecuted for it.”</p>\n<p>Seeing as each panelist held a unique vision, it naturally follows that different writing strategies worked for different writers. Alex Dinelaris (“Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance”) likes to spend eight–nine months structuring a screenplay “to every inch of its life.” But often, he allows his subconscious to take over and handle the inspirational side of things.</p>\n<p>“I have two babies and when I’m changing the diaper or cooking, that’s when the subconscious starts to work,” Dinelaris explained. “An idea will hit me and when they start to pile up to the point where I think they might suffocate me, I’d fly to that little place in Puerto Rico. Cell phone doesn’t work, internet doesn’t work but eight–nine days later, I’d come back with a draft.”</p>\n<p>Max Frye (“Foxcatcher”) likes to take an old-fashioned route via yellow legal pad and felt pen. But when he takes it to the computer, the transcript is, in essence, already a rewrite. The blend of old and modern writing tools seems effective, though Frye admitted that procrastination was still an issue.</p>\n<p>“I’d get to the point where I’d keep putting it off,” Frye said, “and then it’ll be 6 o’ clock and I’d go ‘Oh, well, it’s coffee time.’ But I completely changed my life by writing first thing in the morning without doing anything else. If I even go to the bank, I’m ruined for the day.”</p>\n<p>Several panelists described similar experiences from hunting for inspiration to forcing oneself to work (Gilroy reported using stone as his writing tablet). While these were some of several recurring themes in the writers’ work, it’s clear that none of their careers started on the same course. Whether it’s utilizing the experiences from a past profession or revisiting a childhood passion, SBIFF’s writer’s panel showed that a story doesn’t necessarily start with the script as much as it starts with the heart.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/","id":6063,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6062,6061,6060],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":12,"route":"/categories/artsweek/film-and-tv","highestPage":15}},"__N_SSG":true}
