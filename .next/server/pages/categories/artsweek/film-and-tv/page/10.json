I believe the audience in the Pollock did as well, as they were not only laughing uproariously at the string of witticisms that flowed freely from his mouth, but also at the rest of the characters, realized by the collaborative efforts of John McNamara and Jay Roach.</p>\n<p>The eponymous film relegates the most turbulent period in the screenwriter’s life — during which he and his fellow members of the Hollywood Ten were blacklisted from working in Hollywood thanks to the U.S. government finding them in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify.</p>\n<p>The film is about an ideological battle for justice, as well as a study of Trumbo as a person. The acclaimed writer is a Communist who loves money and a family man more invested in his work than family. He’s an intellectual blind to the fact that his crusade is hurting those he cares about, yet he continues to undermine the forces that put him and his fellow writers out of mainstream Hollywood by writing for a B-movie studio (run by John Goodman in his usual fine, somewhat disgruntled form) and working with fellow blacklisted writers, one of whom is played by the suitably acerbic Louis C.K. But I digress. Will “Trumbo” earn Bryan Cranston his first Oscar? Who knows, but if he doesn’t at least get nominated, I’ll (insert half-assed Cold War joke disguised as a threat here) the Academy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Out of the film’s expansive ensemble cast, some other notable and as of yet unmentioned names include Elle Fanning as Trumbo’s strong-willed daughter Nikola (a role she absolutely excels in), Alan Tudyk as indignant writer Ian McLellan Hunter (and former professor of McNamara’s) and Christian Berkel in a hilariously scene-stealing performance as the dry-humored director of “Exodus,” Otto Preminger. However, I do have to admit confusion as to why Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje got such a high billing in the credits; while he was quite good in his role, he was onscreen for less than ten minutes.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a film such as this one, however, credit absolutely must be given to the screenwriter. McNamara managed to generate smart humor and really rile up the emotions in his script. Often, the humor comes from the dialogue as opposed to the situations the characters find themselves in (with the exception of one gleefully violent scene featuring John Goodman taking a baseball bat to a politician in the epitome of a liberal apologist’s wet dream), showcasing the biting wit of Hollywood’s best.  Through both the celebrity figures’ and the common man’s treatment of Trumbo and company, we are reminded of how overwhelmingly, cruelly paranoid (and, in John Wayne’s case, even somewhat hypocritical) communist-era America was. In light of … ahem, recent events, one cannot help feeling a sense of déjà vu; as Roach said during the Q&amp;A portion of the Pollock screening, “Who would spend millions of dollars on a committee to ask hours of questions and get nothing?” Ouch.</p>\n<p>Once the film was over and the applause had died down, the gangly Roach and the squinting McNamara strode onstage to be greeted by the smiling Pollock director, Matthew Ryan. When asked about how he had come to write the film, McNamara described how he had first encountered Bruce Cook’s biography Dalton Trumbo in his 20s, only to adapt it 30 years later. A friend who had read the book convinced him when he they said, “It’s the rarest thing: a true story with a happy ending.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, former “Austin Powers” director Jay Roach (a franchise which he said he’d be willing to work on again) sung the praises of many, including McNamara for his script and the Hollywood Ten for their sarcastic wit. He told amusing stories about the cast as well, such as recounting Helen Mirren’s love for her character’s hats and Elle Fanning’s unnerving ability to refrain from blinking. Roach also highlighted the conservative views America held at the time, highlighting his father’s own opinions and the film industry’s efforts to make Hollywood seem more “American.”</p>\n<p>“Trumbo’s” ultimate prevailing theme (one which the trailer shoves in your face) is that nobody has the right to tell you what to do and how to think. If someone like Dalton Trumbo comes face to face with overwhelming odds and stand up against them, they’ll come out all the stronger in the end. And no matter how bad the fight gets, nobody is ever truly alone.  If I may paraphrase the line that got the loudest applause, “For better or worse…we are Spartacus.”</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to say that the experience was worth sitting in the front row, as well as the ensuing cramping in the back of his neck.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/","id":5907,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5906,5905,5904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Spielberg.

When I found out that it was directed by Steven Spielberg (you better know who he is) and written by the Coen brothers (my favorite filmmakers, hands down), I nearly fainted with movie-buff glee. The idea of all this filmmaking talent coming together, coupled with the fact that Tom Hanks would be in the lead role, made seeing this film a priority that would (hopefully) justify taking time away from writing my five-page Comm 1 paper.</p>\n<p>The first thing that stood out in my mind was Tom Hanks in his role as Atticus Finch. Yes, yes, I know in reality he’s portraying real-life insurance lawyer James Donovan, but from how this character acts and speaks (apart from when he calls a CIA agent something that could also be shortened into three letters), one would think Gregory Peck had risen from the dead. Is Hanks destined for another Oscar, as some claim? Well … maybe. His performance didn’t rock my world, but it did poke it a few times.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hanks shares the screen mostly with Shakespearean and Tony-winning actor Mark Rylance, portraying Rudolf Abel. A Russian spy caught by the FBI, he surprisingly provides most of the film’s humor in the form of deadpan questions and observations. The rest of the cast is devoid of big names (Alan Alda and Jesse Plemons are in only minor parts), but everyone plays their respective characters with conviction. It is both amusing to see Donovan’s son planning on what to do in the event of a nuclear strike and heart-wrenching to witness a woman cry helplessly as her friend is beaten by East German police.</p>\n<p>I think its worthwhile mentioning that even though this film was penned by the Coens (as well as Matt Charman, a relative newcomer to screenwriting) it doesn’t feel Coen-y. Steven Spielberg hasn’t brought us a quirky dark comedy, but a serious thriller that captures the Cold War tensions reflected in the more common people. Americans are all quick to hang a communist and the East Germans are desperate to cross the Berlin Wall, both during and after its construction. Despite the bleak setting, there’s still occasional sly humor to be found that may take an eagle eye (so to speak) to appreciate some of it.</p>\n<p>But this <em>is </em>a Spielberg film and with that comes some sentimentality that may feel like it’s hitting you over the head. The master director brings up adages like being able to take a hit and keep on coming, as well as having the courage of taking a task nobody else will. That first theme is weaved into the story somewhat, but it still comes across as forced when a character tells an entire story to reveal that theme to us. The latter one at least boasts a degree of subtlety, but you won’t be able to escape the feeling that this has all been told to you over a dozen times by now in other movies.</p>\n<p>But now we come to the universal philosophical question that plagues all film critics, one that we must inevitably address: who will enjoy this film? I’d say if you’re a fan of Steven, Joel or Ethan, this movie is hands-down a given. For the average moviegoer, this will be a tense experience I promise you’ll find rewarding. But if you’re anywhere close to the median age of all the other theatergoers I watched the movie with (which was probably ‘round seventy), something tells me you’ll see it anyways just because it’s your only way to re-watch those cheesy PSAs that told you you could survive a nuke by ducking under your desk.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung really just wanted an excuse not to see “Crimson Peak,” the sissy.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65897\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/spielberg-hanks-the-coens-hell-yes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65897\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/spielberg-hanks-the-coens-hell-yes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/spielberg-hanks-the-coens-hell-yes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/spielberg-hanks-the-coens-hell-yes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/spielberg-hanks-the-coens-hell-yes/","id":5911,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5910,5909,5908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Spike Lee’s “4 Little Girls” Comes to MCC Theater","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4-lil-girls.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4-lil-girls.jpeg?resize=800%2C451&ssl=1","description":"In its 239 year lifespan, America has never seen one day of genuine racial harmony.

Brief periods of superficial equality are constantly interrupted by hate crimes. This pattern has haunted our society since African Americans gained “freedom” in 1865. In Spike Lee’s 1997 documentary, “4 Little Girls<em>,</em>” one specific tragedy is illustrated by families who lost their children in a 1963 Birmingham, Alabama calamity. Americans have surely come a long way since 1963. Nevertheless, the film’s content oozes relevancy in 2015.</p>\n<p>On Sep. 15, 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama. What <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.\">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> described as “one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity” was a product of Ku Klux Klan violence. The incident took the lives of four black children who were attending a youth fellowship. Their names were Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Carol Denise McNair.</p>\n<p>“4 Little Girls” was produced by Spike Lee’s production company: “40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks.” As a leading African-American advocate for racial equality, Lee’s title as the producer of this film is no surprise. Credibility immediately amplifies when the opening production credit reads, “A Spike Lee Joint.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film commences with a lethargic montage of Civil Rights protest footage and shots of four gravestones. Joan Baez’s “Birmingham Sunday” compliments the visuals, foreshadowing the story to be told.</p>\n<p>Family members and friends of Wesley and McNair narrate the bulk of the documentary, which is a history lesson in itself. Much of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement thrived in Birmingham, where racism heavily polluted the population. The families give a thorough background of the Movement’s presence in Birmingham. Authentic footage of violence and brutality intertwine the narration, setting the scene for the pith of the film.</p>\n<p>When it comes time to narrate the morning of Sep. 15, observable grief takes over each family member. Their anguish is uncomfortable to witness, as it symbolizes one of the ugliest chapters in U.S. history. Crime scene images flash quickly, appearing just long enough to process the terror.</p>\n<p>Carol’s parents, Maxine and Chris McNair, narrate most of the closing scenes of the film. They explain how the bombing galvanized intense protests. The explosion was a pivotal point in American history. The story made headlines across the country, causing many to recognize Southern racism as having gone too far.</p>\n<p>The injustice of killing innocent children transcends racial barriers. As an activist, Spike Lee attempts to leave audiences with new, enlightened perspectives. “4 Little Girls” does just that. Cold-blooded murder is a brutal crime, especially when the victims have only seen a decade of life.</p>\n<p>“Birmingham Sunday” foreshadows the horrific story that is told in “4 Little Girls<em>.</em>” However, it also contains a very important motif. At the ending of each verse, Baez sings, “and the choirs kept singing of freedom.” This lyric stands as a testament to the black community’s willful and determined response to the tragedy. The Birmingham bombing only intensified the passion in those fighting for equality during the Civil Rights Movement.</p>\n<p>The modern-day race tragedies that strike our delicate country follow a similar trajectory as the Birmingham sequence. Initial outrage and grief are followed by the emergence of activism and protest. The four little girls who were killed in 1963 were the Trayvon Martins and Michael Browns of an earlier generation.</p>\n<p>Just as important as the innocent lives that are lost in past and present tragedies is the way in which the public decides to respond. The fight for equality has made strides since the Birmingham bombing, but we are still far from finished. “4 Little Girls” is an excellent documentary that will surely spark the same internal flame that forms when modern day tragedies hit the news.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65884\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/spike-lees-4-little-girls-comes-to-mcc-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65884\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/spike-lees-4-little-girls-comes-to-mcc-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/spike-lees-4-little-girls-comes-to-mcc-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/spike-lees-4-little-girls-comes-to-mcc-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/spike-lees-4-little-girls-comes-to-mcc-theater/","id":5922,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[5921,5920,5919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Trumbo” Comes to Script to Screen","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trumbo2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trumbo2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Hollywood Ten sounds like a cute name, doesn’t it?

Sort of like the Fab Four or the Magnificent Seven. In reality, though, that name brought only disdain and misery for its members. The Ten were a group of filmmakers blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee as accused communists. One of the Ten was Dalton Trumbo, whose story is the focus of Pollock Theater’s next <em>Script to Screen</em> event.</p>\n<p>Trumbo’s life turned upside down when he refused to testify in front of the Committee. After being blacklisted, he continued to write movie scripts under pseudonyms, including the Kubrick-directed “Spartacus” and “The Brave One,” for which he won an Oscar. The reveal that he had penned such acclaimed films helped to end the blacklist (as well as Senator Joseph McCarthy’s credibility as a nice little bonus).</p>\n<p>“Trumbo,” adapted from Bruce Alexander Cook’s biography, chronicles this turbulent segment of the screenwriter’s life. Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad” fame stars in the titular role, sporting a mustache large enough to intimidate Walter White. Starring alongside Cranston include such famous faces as Diane Lane (portraying Cleo Trumbo), Helen Mirren, Louis C.K. and John Goodman.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the <em>Script to Screen</em> event at the Pollock, two figures central to the film’s production will appear. The first is the main man behind the camera. And although the mention of the name Jay Roach may not ring all that many bells with the general public, it probably sets off an alarm inside the heads of Michael Meyers fans. Roach, director of “Trumbo” also directed the cult classic “Austin Powers” series, produced the infamously-crass “Borat,” starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed the HBO film “Game Change,” which chronicled both Sarah Palin’s rise in popularity amongst conservatives and her downfall in the eyes of the public.</p>\n<p>As for writing the film version of Trumbo’s life, that duty fell to producer John McNamara, who will also be coming to the event. He adapted the screenplay from <em>Dalton Trumbo, </em>written by Cook. McNamara’s past works as a writer include <em>Aquarius</em> (which he created), <em>Prime Suspect</em> and <em>In Plain Sight</em>. He is currently working on <em>The Magicians</em> a SyFy adaptation of Lev Grossman’s novel.</p>\n<p>To see “Trumbo” before its wide release on Nov. 6, and hear both these talented filmmakers discuss it, make plans to be at the Pollock Theater on Oct. 25. While the event, hosted by Matt Ryan, will indeed be free, a reservation is recommended in order to get a decent seat. “Trumbo’s” <em>Script to Screen</em> will last from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.; there is no late admission.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/trumbo-comes-to-script-to-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/trumbo-comes-to-script-to-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/trumbo-comes-to-script-to-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/trumbo-comes-to-script-to-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/trumbo-comes-to-script-to-screen/","id":5927,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5926,5925,5924],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Horror Story: The Hotel Premier","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lady-gaga-ahs-hotel.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lady-gaga-ahs-hotel.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Just when I thought Lady Gaga couldn’t get stranger, she became a soul-sucking seductress.

But I think I liked it? American Horror Story is back in its 5th season with “Hotel.” If I had to describe this premiere in just a few words, they would be clichés, blood and clichés. However, would it really be an American horror story without some low IQ damsels, bad choices, demon children and vampires? Probably not. So, on we go.</p>\n<p>The show begins with a fish-eye lens (because nothing screams terror like a good fish-eye) of two hot blonde tourists checking into the Hotel Cortez in L.A. We’re introduced to the receptionist, Iris (Kathy Bates), who refers to the girls as “Swedish meatballs“ and lets them know the hotel is a “dead zone.” No WiFi. No cell service. Of course. As they walk to their room, we meet the housekeeper who is getting blood stains out of bed sheets due to a “terrible accident.” The Swedish meatballs are less than impressed with their room as it has a vile odor. Lo and behold, the stench came from a halfway decomposed person-thing that crawls out of the stitched up mattress and sends the girls running back to Iris. Monsters under the bed, for sure. She provides them with a new room, the ever elusive room 64. Dun dun dunnnnnn. While there, the tourists get attacked by tiny children with a thirst for blood.</p>\n<p>Scene change. Now, we’re assaulted with a gory, blatantly disgusting crime scene. It includes cut out eyes and tongues put in bowls, and a couple on a bed. Oh, did I forget to mention that the girl is speared to the headboard while the guy, blind and tongueless, is barely alive with his man part still inside her? I’m no newbie to the gore of AHS, but this was a bit much for my liking. Here, we meet Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) who is investigating the crime. When he gets back to his office, he gets a call from an ominous voice who says that they’re going to repeat the gruesome crime again in none other than room 64. Serial killer? Most likely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now we’re back at the hotel where a male junkie is looking for a room, and, surprise surprise, he gets room 64. As he begins doing the things that junkies do, he gets an unpleasant surprise from a mummified being with a very sharp, very dangerous strap-on. Sally (Sarah Paulson), a heroin addict and resident of the hotel, seems to appear from thin air and tells the man that if he wants the pain to stop, he just has to say, “I love you, Sally.” Once he obliges, he immediately dies. Love hurts, my dears.</p>\n<p>Moments later, Detective Lowe arrives at the hotel and demands to go into room 64. He’s escorted by Liz Taylor (cross dressed Denis O’Hare) who I can already tell is going to be one of the favorites this season. Once the Detective checks the room, nothing seems to be out of place, but the Detective seems to recognize a child running around in the halls.</p>\n<p>Finally, The Countess (Lady Gaga) is introduced. Little is known about her other than that she owns the hotel and has a thirst for human blood. Oh, and she has a killer wardrobe. The Countess and Donovan (Matt Bomer) are in some sort of relationship where they seduce couples and kill them afterward. Of course, because this is AHS, you can expect a soft-core porn scene that ends with The Countess and Donovan swimming in a literal pool of blood. Though I must say, it was a beautifully shot scene.</p>\n<p>As if there wasn’t enough confusion about the plotline already, we meet famous fashion designer, Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson) and his son who are (of course) wanting to buy the hotel. The Countess leads Drake’s son through a secret passage way revealing the ultimate kid-fantasy room. What could be so bad about that? Nothing much, except one of the vampire kids is actually the Detective’s missing son. If that wasn’t a big enough bomb to drop, get this: Donovan is actually Iris’s son who overdosed on heroin with Sally, so Iris pushed Sally out of the top floor of the hotel where she met her death on the pavement. %*^#*^%$!!!</p>\n<p>The episode ends with Lowe checking into room 64 as his investigation for the killer begins. Meanwhile, “Hotel California” plays in the background (ha ha).</p>\n<p>Phew. That was a lot to cover.</p>\n<p>I’m still disappointed about Jessica Lange’s departure and the flop of season four, but AHS is back, gorier and more enticing than ever. This premiere definitely held nothing back, and it left SO many questions. Is everyone a ghost or just Sally? Why is The Countess a vampire? Who’s the killer? What’s up with the Detective’s son?</p>\n<p>Only one thing is known: “You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/","id":5920,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[5919,5918,5917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Script To Screen: ‘American Beauty’ Screenwriter Comes to Discuss Film","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/americanbae1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/americanbae1.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Celebrating its 25th episode, the series Script to Screen excels again and brings another Oscar-winning guest in for a screening and a series of analytical questions.

The public’s reaction could not have been better.</p>\n<p>All 298 tickets were sold out and there was a line at the door one hour before the event even started, all just to see one of the most disturbed and ‘salt on the wound’ movies of this generation, <em>American Beauty. </em>The movie is a tragicomedy starred by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening and follows the lives of people living in the suburbs and their insecurities. “It is very hard to say what <em>American Beauty</em> is about. [It] is about a lot different things … the younger people can understand being the awkward teenager, so in so many different levels the movie reaches people,” Ryan, the host of the event, said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of the movie’s great cultural repercussion, many of the audience members, composed mainly by students, had already seen the film. However, more than half had never seen it on the big screen. The result was a very participative crowd that laughed, sighed and even talked to the screen, entertained through the whole two-hour movie.</p>\n<p>After the movie ended, everybody stayed for the so anticipated Q&amp;A with screenwriter Ball, who had not seen the feature in five years. Ryan asked several questions, usually referring to a scene or quote that he personally enjoys, leading to a result that he describes as “[Ball] told really funny stories.” The whole sequence of questions was recorded and will soon be available at <em>uctv.tv</em>, where previous events have already summoned millions of visualizations.</p>\n<p>Following Ryan’s interview, the questions were opened to the public, who mainly asked about Ball’s method of writing, his process, his manias and preferences.

But it’s true: “The Martian,” the adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel, is pretty damn good as a matter of fortunate fact. And, even better, it stands out amongst the other two prominent extraterrestrial survival flicks of recent years, “Gravity” and “Interstellar.”</p>\n<p>Honestly though, that’s not exactly impressive in “Interstellar’s” case; despite its wonderful effects and TARS (my favorite movie robot), the film still ended up being predictable and had a plethora of ridiculous moments. The moment Matt Damon’s character started espousing philosophy out of nowhere to Matthew McConaughey, I started counting down to his inevitable homicidal breakdown. Dr. Mann became a cliché.</p>\n<p>Mark Watney, in contrast, is wisecracking, extremely competent and intelligent and just a downright pleasure to watch. He goes against the typical characterization of scientists being stuffy and antisocial bores and does stuff like proclaiming himself a space-pirate and taking a goofy picture of himself for all of Earth to see. The combination of Damon’s committed, charming performance and the tight writing successfully establishes Watney as the emotional centerpiece of the movie. It almost does it too well; I could do with another movie of him hanging out on the red planet.

While both films feature nigh identical dust storms, the wide, beautiful shots of Mars’s landscape (Was it CGI? Enhanced imagery of Earth? I couldn’t tell initially, and I loved that.) provide substantial visual eye candy. As we watch Watney’s rover trudge across the red planet, tiny against the glowing, inhospitable surface, we are reminded of how staggeringly the odds are stacked against this lone man.</p>\n<p>But the extraterrestrial Robinson Crusoe isn’t alone; a brilliant ensemble cast backs him up both on Earth and in space. Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Benedict Wong, Donald Glover and Mackenzie Davis make up the haggard NASA scientists struggling against the clock to find out how to send supplies or rescue Watney before his food inevitably runs out. There’s a very sharp dynamic here as we see these people try to help the astronaut (more to avoid public scrutiny than for the sake of his wellbeing) by pooling together resources and ideas both sensible and innovative. Although Earth does feel crowded at times, each character gets a standout moment. Not once did I think, “It would have made no difference if this character had been taken out.”</p>\n<p>And, up in space, Jessica Chastain (another “Interstellar” alum), Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan (both Marvel vets) and Aksel Hennie play Watney’s intrepid crewmembers forced to leave him behind. Like Watney, this group is also a bunch of smart wisecrackers, and the chemistry between them is absolutely sublime; we care about them and like watching them interact with each other. Both of these kinds of dynamics were absent from “Gravity” and “Interstellar,” the former’s case because there were only two characters and the latter’s case because “Interstellar” was, as Immortan Joe would say, “MEDIOCRE!”</p>\n<p>But to be honest for a moment: It’s pretty easy to praise a film when you compare it to other ones that lack in certain qualities. And while that may admittedly seem, in a sense, cheap, I think it shows that Ridley Scott managed to craft a film that manages to rise to the top of the sci-fi genre scene by giving us a movie that makes survival <em>fun </em>for once<em>. </em>“The Martian” has become the fifth film I’ve ever wanted to go back and see twice and the second this year. I have only one negative thing (if you can call it that) to say and it’s actually a concern.</p>\n<p>You’d better manage to top this, J.J.</p>\n<p><em>The other four are “Godzilla,” “Fury Road,” “Prometheus” and “Ratatouille.”</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

three in the morning, I went on Netflix and popped on the first episode of “The Walking Dead.” The first 20 minutes absolutely dripped with atmosphere; Rick’s few minutes in that hospital was probably the most frightening sequence in the history of the series, and I was hooked. But at the end of the pilot for “Fear the Walking Dead,” I turned to my mother, a fellow fan whom I successfully converted two years ago, and said, “Eh.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t want to be entirely dismissive; I know what the show-runners were going for here. They wanted to develop the characters and really tease the start of the zombie apocalypse. And that strategy partially succeeds; high-school employees Travis and Madison are likable enough leads, and so is Madison’s son (played by Frank Dillane, who had a brief stint as a younger Voldemort). Thus far, he is the only character I’d actually like to see in a zombie apocalypse because, despite having some major drug issues, he can clearly get himself out of a bind. His sister, however, is another story. She’s apparently Berkeley-bound, yet she skips class and watches videos on her phone when she doesn’t. Bullshit. Travis’s son also acts like a little snot, so that’s two characters I’d like to see get eaten by the undead.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the pilot unfortunately succumbed to utilizing what “The Walking Dead” (and most other horror mediums) seem to think is scary: jump scares.  So pathetically predictable and insultingly cheap were they that I felt like FWD was treating me like an idiot. Madison stares at her boss, a school principal, as he’s faced away from her and hunched over. The camera zooms in, the music swells. He turns around, BWWAAAAAoh. He was eavesdropping on his fellow teachers through the PA system.  Funnily enough, this same actor also played a high school principal in a film starring Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori Grimes).  The conspiracy theories/fan fiction that could stem from that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alone </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could probably form the basis for a more compelling hour of TV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for that aforementioned slow burn approach to the zombie apocalypse, it gives middling returns. There’s one kid who has pieced together what’s going down across the country and feels powerless to stop it. Now that’s quite compelling. And then when video footage of a zombie attacking emergency response personnel emerges online, an entire Los Angeles school district decides to end class early that day. Now </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quite stupid. What? Did the district employees think, “Uh oh, let’s send the kids home. Learning about geometry will only add to their trauma.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me, I want this show to be good. As a reader of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Walking Dead</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comics, I’d like to watch a series where I don’t know what could happen next. So, hopefully, the characters will manage to hold my interest, there’ll be no more jump scares (as if) and we’ll all get the awesome zombie apocalypse origin story we were promised. This series definitely has potential. It had better goddamn use it.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung’s just bitter because he knows he has no chance surviving in a zombie apocalypse.</span></i></p>\n<div

that I knew I was going to hate and give more of my money to the hellspawn that is Adam Sandler in the process, or see “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!,” a movie I knew would be so bad I’d love, for free.</p>\n<p>For a bit of background, the “Sharknado” movies have been produced by the Asylum, a film company whose modus operandi has been to rip off popular movies and give their directly-to-DVD films similar titles in the hope that the average consumer will be too stupid to notice (“Transmorphers,” “Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies,” etc). And having seen a couple of them, I can vouch for their universal ineptitude. The “Sharknado” series, however, ups the originality while keeping the production values at more or less the same level of shit. The first “Sharknado” was so bad it was hilarious. “Sharknado 2: The Second One” at least embraced its craziness and had fun with it. “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” is a decent mix of the two.</p>\n<p>As a bad movie connoisseur, I was practically ecstatic about this movie. “Sharknado” is one of those types of films that you watch to mock and laugh at its stupidity. And I laughed. I laughed a lot. The effects look like they were ripped from a PS2 game and the story still makes about as much sense as … well, the last two movies. And, of course, all the random lunacy: shark statues coming alive, mascara bullets, the <em>sharkicane</em>. The only way to describe “Oh Hell No!” is ludicrous. In a good way! If you’re of legal drinking age, I guarantee you will enjoy this batshit insane affair exponentially more than those of us too lazy to get fake IDs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But you have to remember that when you take the bat away, you have something else entirely. I’m not particularly happy that all the advertising promised this was a Washington DC-set film; that lasts maybe ten minutes before the opening credits. In an eerily similar move to “Jaws 3,” the movie spends most of its time at a theme park (come and spend a day with us and get eaten by sharks, too!). Universal Studios Orlando, in this case, is where we spend good chunks of time watching the protagonist’s daughter going on the rides and interacting with a bland boy she happens to meet, while her pregnant mother (Tara Reid) is off wondering about what she’ll name her unborn child. It’s not crazy, it’s not compelling, it’s boring to the point that I had to scream into a pillow to let out my frustration.</p>\n<p>Oh, and speaking of Tara Reid, <em>get rid of her already! </em>She’s always been the one constant dragging “Sharknado” down; her character sucks and her acting sucks harder. All April does is nag Fin (Ian Ziering) whenever he’s about to do anything badass and heroic and stare slack-jawed at everything else that’s happening around her. And speaking of poor female protagonists, Nova (Cassie Scerbo) returns from the first film. She has one fleetingly badass scene before devolving into eye candy. Apparently, she only wants to wear body-armor on her back, as she keeps her top zipped open for the rest of the film, exposing her ample cleavage to the world in SyFy’s most desperate attempt to retain an audience yet (after making these movies, of course).</p>\n<p>And speaking of returning characters, “Oh Hell No!” brings back various real-life celebrities as well as a plethora of new ones for a variety of brief cameo roles ranging from unimaginative to crowd-pleasingly proper. While Penn and Teller don’t do much besides getting squished, if any “Game of Thrones” fans want recompense for the death of everyone’s favorite curly-haired emo, then they’ll be pleased to see a certain bearded author being eaten alive. But if you’re going to get Ann Coulter — probably the most hateful woman in American media — into your film, at the very least give me the satisfaction of watching her being slowly eaten alive by a great white.</p>\n<p>“Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” is by no means a good movie. It looks like crap. It’s paced like crap. Ninety-four point three percent of the dialogue is crap (I counted). It’s a true turd of a B-movie, but this turd just happened to dress itself up in a tuxedo and go on a bloody shark mass-murdering spree while wielding a laser-chainsaw and giving the finger to film snobs like moi. It has no shame and it’s proud of it.</p>\n<p>May the Great Blueberry Muffin bless this sublime travesty. And if that sentence made no sense to you, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is seriously considering getting a Twitter account to vote for </em>that<em> character to be killed

id=\"caption-attachment-64388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>KBPS.org</em></p></div>\n<p>We’ve seen a lot of different versions of Sherlock Holmes over the years, from the stereotypical deerstalker-wearing version popularized and made iconic by the likes of Basil Rathbone to the much-adored, long-faced Benedict Cumberbatch. And in over a century of on-screen depictions, not one has been as utterly human as Ian McKellen’s “Mr. Holmes.”</p>\n<p>In the titular film, Holmes is 93 years old, and has spent 35 of those years in self-imposed solitude as recompense for the results of his final case, a case he struggles to recall. He vows to remember and write the true account of what really happened, free from the fictional embellishments from the mind of John Watson that have characterized Holmes for the rest of the world. But this is not the great detective we knew; senility is kicking in and he hobbles on a cane. It’s a little heartbreaking to see a man of such genius have to write people’s names on his sleeves. Sometimes, this frail old man doesn’t even seem like Sherlock Holmes; rather, he seems more like your average doddering grandfather trying to maintain his charisma in the face of mental deterioration.</p>\n<p>That angle itself unfolds wonderfully between Holmes and Roger Munro (played by the acting revelation Milo Parker, who bears an uncanny resemblance to “Game of Thrones” actor Thomas Sangster). Roger tries to immerse himself in Holmes’s world, making his own deductions and helping him with his beekeeping while Holmes tells him the details of his old life and tries to set the boy on the right track of life to prevent him from making the same mistakes he did. It’s a very interesting and <em>new </em>dynamic; we’ve, after all, have always had the Holmes-Watson relationship as the primary medium for showing the extent of Sherlock’s affection toward any human being in general. We’ve never had Holmes the grandfather before, a new concept that is played up quite convincingly. Make no mistake, however; Holmes has not turned into a teddy bear in his frailing years. He can still be cool and rely too much on his brain, rather than his heart.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Which brings us to the theme of this movie (ooh, a theme!) which is regret. Sherlock Holmes, is after all, known primarily for acting like a computer with legs. But deep down is a man who has finally realized in his old age that being so logical has hurt other people, himself most of all. For the first time, Sherlock Holmes comes to terms that there are consequences to his actions, good intentions or not. It’s one of the rare instances when the great detective actually undergoes some true <em>development. </em>Holmes is just a man and, like him, we’ve all forgotten.</p>\n<p>To sum these points up, this is without a doubt Ian McKellen’s film. Through his knockout performance, he has brought us an immensely humanizing portrayal of such a beloved character that we oh-so-rarely gain true insight into. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s magnum opus has been radically redefined while still keeping to his roots and that in itself is amazing.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, however, this film is not an adrenaline-inducing thrill-ride like something that Steven Moffat or Guy Ritchie would be content to provide us with; “Mr Holmes” is very calm, full of melancholy, but does have a touch of mystery and crime about it. Granted though, some characters have intentions that come off as unintentionally nonsensical, but that does not weigh the film down to a significant degree.</p>\n<p>To those who are wondering if this film is even worth their time … elementary, my dear friend. Elementary.</p>\n<p><em>The guy who directed the last two Twilight movies did this?

No. Was it fun?  A bit.  Does it prey on your nostalgia? Eyup. At the end of the day, it’s just another “Terminator” movie, for better or worse. Everything you expect to see in a “Terminator” movie is here: guns, explosions, one-liners, Arnie. So if you just want to watch a rehash of the older “Terminator” movies, you might just enjoy this film. Everyone else need not attend.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the plot this time? Pretty much just the second and third movies again: Stop Skynet before it goes online. Arnie gets sent back in time to protect his charge, throws and gets thrown by a technologically superior Terminator, the main male and main female bond and before you know it, credits. Except this is the first “Terminator” movie to include a shameless sequel plug, so it has<i> that </i>going for it.

Well, Sarah Connor’s back (and played by Emilia Clark, the second “Game of Thrones” actress to stand in Linda Hamilton’s place), and this time, she knows the plot of the original movie, so that makes it a little awkward for her to be around Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney, who I might have actually liked a bit more than Michael Biehn). The two parents of future messiah John Connor (Jason Clarke) spend the first half of the movie dealing with the original Terminator plus a T-1000 (why are the T-1000s always cops?) alongside the T-800 (the Governator), before going to 2017 to stop Skynet from taking over the internet (again). From there, it’s another standard, we-have-24-hours-to-save-the-world, bullshit affair. Why couldn’t they just go to 2016? At least then they could get their bearings, maybe share some beers, watch the new “Star Wars” movie on Blu-ray.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Afterward, they have to deal with John<i>,</i> who’s been converted into a T-3000 – which pretty much functions exactly like a T-1000 – so I’m wondering how disappointing the T-2000 could possibly be. And, like most action movie villains, the T-3000 doesn’t seem to know how to run, over half his dialogue is villainous monologuing and he misses too many opportunities to kill the heroes. If Skynet wanted its enemies dead so badly, it should have programmed the only agent it bothered to send without a mouth.</p>\n<p>However, credit must certainly be given where it is due. Schwarzenegger is still a lot of fun as the Terminator, delivering lines that wouldn’t be nearly as funny without his emotionless delivery. In fact, I’m pretty sure that this may be the funniest “Terminator” film yet, and no, not unintentionally; I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of my theater (who were also laughing to the seriously unfunny trailer for “Pixels,” but still).  And the actions scenes will certainly whet anyone’s appetite for violence. Lotta bing bang boom, pew pew, you get my drift.</p>\n<p>But bottom line, “Terminator Genisys” is nothing new. It’s pretty much just a rehash of the older films, for better or worse. There is sufficient humorous and nostalgic enjoyment to be had and decent action, too, but none of the performances are compelling, and there are more plot holes than there were bullets fired. But hey, if you want to watch people shoot holes in a robot and watch as those holes are slowly filled in with CGI over and over again for the umpteenth time, whatever floats your boat.<br>\n<i></i></p>\n<p><i>Alex Wehrung was disappointed at this movie for not being bad enough to make writing this review fun.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64309\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64309\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/","id":5914,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5913,5912,5911],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Satisfactory Catharsis: ‘Inside Out’ is a Good Time","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1422842928997.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1422842928997.jpeg?resize=980%2C563&ssl=1","description":"Imagination can be a wonderful thing, depending on how it’s applied.

If you muck it up, you end up with something that <i>seems </i>cool, but in reality, you realize that someone fell asleep behind the controls. Take “Doctor Who” for instance; it has a lot of awesome and wildly creative ideas behind it, but I can’t help but laugh in derision when I watch it half the time. Granted, that may be because I’m a bona-fide a-hole (or because I have taste, take your pick), but regardless, I can tell when an idea has been used to its full effect. So I can definitely say … ”Cars” is still too weird for its own good, but “Inside Out” works with its potential.</p>\n<p>Plot-wise, Pixar’s newest endeavour is about a few days in the life of Riley, an 11-year-old girl who has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, upending her life. Her emotional struggles are personified by Joy (Tina Fey’s shadow, Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (whatshername from “The Mindy Project”), Anger (Lewis Black) and Fear (Bill Hader), who control and monitor Riley’s actions via a jelly-bean-shaped command console. When Joy and Sadness accidentally end up far from their HQ with all of the memories that define Riley’s personality, they have to traverse throughout the other lands representing different aspects of Riley’s consciousness and get back to the HQ before Riley becomes an emotionless shell. Yeah, it’s pretty complicated, but thankfully, never confusing.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying (I did set this up in my intro, after all) that this film has some stunningly creative ideas, building an intricate world inside this girl’s head. Riley’s memories are glass spheres that work like GIFs, her most important memories create islands reflecting the standout aspects of her personality (I can already imagine the dozens of lazy sketches on Deviantart depicting everyone else’s islands), her fears are kept in a prison and, most humorously, according to the movie, those annoying jingles that keep popping up in our heads are caused by minion-like workers sending the corresponding memory sphere up to HQ just to annoy the emotions. Dreams are created by a film studio, workers vaccuum up and dump decaying and unneeded memories and daydreams are delivered by a train. Bottom line, everything inside Riley’s head is a plethora of prodigious personifications, gorgeous to behold.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And indeed, “Inside Out” is gorgeously animated, which is probably a given considering it’s a Pixar film.  It’s very bright and colorful inside Riley’s head, whereas San Francisco is misty and a little droll-looking. Scarily accurate. The human characters, Riley especially, have perfect facial animations. Bear in mind, if the people didn’t look like they were properly emoting, the film would have taken a serious hit. Thankfully, it didn’t. There’s also a standout sequence where Joy and Sadness are reduced to abstract forms inside Riley’s head, gradually devolving into mere shape and color, allowing the animators to show off some other styles.</p>\n<p>The emotions look and act like they would; Joy is light-footed and flies all over the screen, Sadness moves lethargically, Anger’s head literally catches on fire, Fear, fittingly, has the largest eyes and Disgust looks and acts like a snobby teenager. They are also designed to look fuzzy, therefore huggable and thus practically impossible to dislike. It helps that they’re relatable; they’re not groundbreaking, complex characters by any means, but they’re certainly fun to watch. I felt a strange kinship with Fear when he made droll comments on Riley’s predictably-plotted dreams.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, “Inside Out” is an enjoyable romp. It’s colorful, emotionally complex, boasts a wonderful, creatively-endowed world and has fun characters.</p>\n<p><i>If you ever see Alex Wehrung wearing a TARDIS shirt … his mom bought it.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64265\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-06/a-satisfactory-catharsis-inside-out-is-a-good-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64265\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-06/a-satisfactory-catharsis-inside-out-is-a-good-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-06/a-satisfactory-catharsis-inside-out-is-a-good-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-06/a-satisfactory-catharsis-inside-out-is-a-good-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-06/a-satisfactory-catharsis-inside-out-is-a-good-time/","id":5921,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5920,5919,5918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jurassic World: Life Will Always Find a Way to Bite You in the Ass","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jworld.0.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jworld.0.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Whether or not the Jurassic Park die-hards hate this movie and the average blockbuster junkie loves it, I think we can all agree on one thing: It could have been a lot worse.

Though were the park administrators smart, we wouldn’t have a movie and Alan Grant would be calling up Ian Malcolm to tell him to shove his chaos theory mantra up his ass. So, I guess the main message here is to go along with the ride, no matter how eye-roll-inducing it can get.</p>\n<p>But don’t let my cynicism dishearten you; it’s definitely a very enjoyable ride. For starters, the characters of “Jurassic World” are a considerable improvement from the chumps from the last two films (but perhaps I’m just relieved that Téa Leoni isn’t back to shatter glass with her screams). Chris Pratt, hot off the success of “Lego” and “Guardians” plays Owen, Jurassic World’s voice of reason, raptor-whisperer and one of the two or three actually competent members of the park’s staff. Bryce Dallas Howard is the short-sighted park manager who eventually comes around and tries to remedy her mistakes (all while running from dinosaurs in high heels). Her nephews come to the park, serving as both plot catalysts and mediums for a shoehorned divorce subplot that only manages to contribute maybe another minute to the film’s runtime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But who cares about the characters, there are DINOSAURS! And lots of ‘em. One of the great joys about “Jurassic World” is seeing John Hammond’s vision come true; “Jurassic World” is everything that “Jurassic Park” was meant to be, and then some. There’s a petting zoo where children ride baby triceratopses, a SeaWorld-like stadium featuring the gigantic Mosasaurus, a much bigger paddock for the T-rex (the very same T-rex from the first film) and more. There’s also more dinosaur-on-dinosaur fighting in this movie than the last three films combined; the final confrontation had me grinning like an idiot, for it was so stupidly awesome.</p>\n<p>“Jurassic World” also gets philosophical to a degree, satirizing the nature of franchises and how people want new attractions/sequels to be bigger, better and more eye-catching. This is reflected in the Indominus Rex (or as Jeremy Jahns rightfully calls it, the Holyshitasaurus), a mesh of multiple creatures that was created to boost park attendance. When the Indominus gets involved in the aforementioned final fight, without giving too much away, it’s almost as if director Colin Trevorrow wanted to remind the audience that “World” will never be as good as “Park,” but “World” is still fun, regardless.</p>\n<p>But, as the internet has probably informed you by now, “Jurassic World” has a few glaring flaws. Let’s start with the villain. God, I hate this character. Not because of some well-written trait of his, that would imply he’s … well, well-written. Vincent D’Onofrio’s Vic Hoskins might as well have walked up to Chris Pratt, turned to the audience, and said, “Hi, I’ll be your mandatory douchebag for this feature,” his villainous demeanor is that obvious. He goes off on a plot to weaponize the velociraptors, which leads me to believe that Hoskins never watched an “Alien” movie, otherwise he’d know that trying to weaponize monsters with very large teeth usually gets you turned into a chew toy. Wait … oh my god, InGen becomes Weyland-Yutani!</p>\n<p>The film’s attempt to prey upon your nostalgia via John Williams’s classic theme falls flat on its face initially (using that music in tandem with shots of a hotel is not epic, Mr. Trevorrow), and rebounds later (I won’t spoil it, but … squeeee!). But speaking of nostalgia, there are enough callbacks and Easter eggs to satisfy fans of the original film, but not too many as to seem desparate.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, “Jurassic World” is an extremely entertaining flick that manages to stand on its own amongst other science-fiction films, but, as the movie itself makes abundantly clear, it pales in comparison to the original.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is anticipating the day when CinemaSins rips “Jurassic World” a new one.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/","id":5912,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5911,5910,5909],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Reel Loud 2015 Suffers from Poor Planning","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Wayne-Isham-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Wayne-Isham-1.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Any student-coordinated event that exists outside the realm of the two hour SRB multipurpose room shindig is something that deserves applause.

When a group of college kids get together and learn the business of planning, budgeting, scheduling and reaching out to talent, magic happens. But at this year’s Reel Loud, the 24th anniversary of the adored silent film festival — gosh, I hate to say it — the student coordination wasn’t as seamless as it could have been.</p>\n<p>First, the MCs were a bit awkward and lacked enthusiasm. Perhaps they were nervous or placed in at the last second, but the role of an MC is to butter up the crowd with corny jokes and provide easy transitions for performing acts. Reel Loud’s MCs did nothing of the sort and committed the ultimate MC crime: pronouncing names incorrectly. It was awful to listen to ten minutes of “Shag-nes-sai” when the silent auction winners were announced. Of course, it was impossible to do a night-before practice of winners’ names, but a five minute run-through before stepping out onstage would have done wonders.</p>\n<p>Another issue at Reel Loud was that parts of it were just plain random. DJ Allie from KCSB 91.9 FM came onstage in between Act I and II, and sat herself on a stool with a Macbook on her lap. She proceeded to play a 15 minute mash-up of famous movie lines and electric beats. The set featured flavorful movie throwbacks like “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” but the DJ’s placement atop a stool in the middle of the stage was random at best and boring at worst. DJ Allie is an enormously talented individual who runs KCSB, but having her sit cross-legged with a laptop and a spotlight shining on her pigtails was not the most entertaining situation at a film festival. Perhaps she could’ve been given a table to lean on and dance around, like a concert DJ.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the most uncomfortable part of the night was when a music professor came onstage to grant music video legend Wayne Isham with the Inspiring Alumni Award. The music professor meant well, but his history lecture on MTV changing lives and how all Isham needed for his video for “Girls, Girls, Girls” was “motorcycles, girls — better yet — strippers,” was a little out of control. He kept going on and on with his life story, and kept getting cut off by a guy on the sidelines. It was painfully awkward to watch, like when your mother tries to be groovy and tells your friends she’s into wearing thongs now, like the underwear kind. Bleh, mom.</p>\n<p>When Isham finally hit the stage, he smoothed the crunchy peanut butter moment and stole the microphone. “I am so proud to be a fucking Gaucho,” he roared to the crowd. Isham is one badass cool dude who has directed classic videos for everyone from Metallica to Backstreet Boys. The music video legend lavished the films with compliments and made everyone feel good about themselves.</p>\n<p>“I sat back in my chair and went — oh. My fucking god! You’ve got THAT going on here! The music department kicks ass, the film department kicks ass. I am so proud to be a Gaucho,” Isham said, his gruff voice roaring out from beneath a thick beard. Long golden-gray hair shook around his face as he talked. The man looked straight out of Hells Angels and muttered f-bombs like there was no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“YOU inspire me. Forget about being alumni inspiration, I’m talking about the new generation. The new generation! You guys fucking rock … I need to start a new production company right here … this event was mind-blowing.”</p>\n<p>Given that Isham is a star director — the man did “Livin’ La Vida Loca” — his assessment of Reel Loud holds great weight. And in all honesty, the event’s content was pretty good. Art displays mixed with refreshments and a silent auction provided entertainment before the reels spun. Performances by a capella groups Vocal Motion and Brothas From Otha Mothas were met with a warm reception. The event itself — a silent film festival accompanied by live music — is a fantastic concept, and was executed as smoothly as 12 films with 12 different bands could.</p>\n<p>The films were short. Each was under seven minutes and was accompanied by a live ensemble. A favorite was “Choices,” a film by fourth-year physics major Michael Shaughnessy and second-year English major Kayla Barajas. “Choices” portrayed a hospitalized young man as he tried to replay what decisions he made which led to his accident. Heavy guitar strums built energy that complemented the fast scene changes.</p>\n<p>Other notable films included “Ten Toes,” which shows a man with the embarrassing problem of squeaky feet, and “Holy Grail,” a black-and-white movie about a depressed man who digs up a treasure chest that gives the gift of confidence. “Holy Grail” had the good fortune of having a soundtrack written by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/\">Azeem Ward</a>, the world-famous flautist.</p>\n<p>The reel that took home all the glory was “Out,” a cinematic creation by Emma Manley and Stefan Le. “Out” was Manley’s coming out story, and shows her chopping off her hair as she embraces her gender fluidity. It was beautifully shot with brilliant angles, and won the audience choice, cinematography and Scott Wells golden reel awards.</p>\n<p>A tender moment arose at the festival when “I.V. Strong” played scenes of last year’s memorial events. Almost exactly a year ago, film and music students were at Reel Loud when they heard the news that six fellow students had been shot. It was the site of disbelief. The inclusion of “I.V. Strong” allowed everyone to take a moment, reflect, and shed a few tears. It proved cathartic, especially when art professor Kim Yasuda came onstage to speak on the BLUNITE I.V. project.</p>\n<p>All in all though, Reel Loud 2015 could have exercised cleaner organization. But what the hell — if Wayne Isham said the event was mind-blowing, it might as well be true.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63944\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63944\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/","id":5909,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[5908,5907,5906],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cambodian Rock n’ Roll","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?resize=620%2C349&ssl=1","description":"\"Don't Think I've Forgotten\" tells the story of rockers fighting to be heard amidst revolution","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_63837\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"515446483\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63836\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63837\" data-attachment-id=\"63837\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/cambodian-rock-n-roll/dont-think/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?fit=620%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,349\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dont-Think\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?fit=620%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63837\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of berkeleyside.com\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dont-Think.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of <em>berkeleyside.com</em></p></div>\n<p>In the mid ’70s, a communist party that went by the name of Khmer Rouge killed over two million people in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge regime led by Pol Pot sought to restore Cambodia to an agrarian state. In an attempt to destroy the cultural values associated with the “old” society, they targeted musical artists — those who were most in touch with past ideals and could directly communicate them to the people through music.</p>\n<p>“Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten” tells the story of the music that was tucked away during that era of oppression and it does an excellent job of broadcasting it to us through the perspective of many, such as music fans, music producers, royalty and even the surviving artists themselves.</p>\n<p>The director, John Pirozzi, seriously knows how to tell a story. This documentary is the result of nine total years of work; the film itself was completed just several weeks before the world premiere date, and the colossal effort that was put into it does not go unnoticed. “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten” is rich with never-before-seen clips of live performances from the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, recordings of lost songs from Cambodian pop superstars such as Sinn Sisamouth and pictures of other musical artists that are gone now, but still very much alive in the hearts of the Cambodian people.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Essentially, this film is meant to take you back in time to the heyday — a time of hard rock and nightlife in the few decades before the Vietnam War and the Khmer Rouge swept through Cambodia and lay siege to Cambodia’s cultural capital, Phnom Penh. It is a nostalgic anecdote. But it is not all Pirozzi telling the story; it’s those that had some direct connection to the musical movement. The director conducted almost 100 hours worth of interviews, and in those interviews, we get to hear individual stories of discovering music. These interviews make the film extremely personal. As we learn the names and faces of those a part of the music scene, we become connected with them on an emotional level. It’s as if these people are talking directly to us — having a heart-to-heart with us — and disclosing with us the fond memories of their earlier days.</p>\n<p>Pirozzi takes the personal thing to a whole new level by incorporating short scenes of Cambodian everyday life of the time that play as the interviewees share their stories. It’s as if we are teleported back in time to Cambodia and are seeing this moment with our own eyes. It’s genius. Not to mention, the cinematography is breathtaking; in one part of the movie, we are transported to a dance club where “go-go” music is playing and young Cambodians are seen with their big ’60s style haircuts and bell bottoms. It’s all so realistic that it is impossible not to get sucked in.</p>\n<p>However, this level of personalization is what makes the end and personal tales of the oppression so heartbreaking. So many of the widely loved musical artists whose songs make up the soundtrack of the film were among the two million killed — it’s certainly a hard pill to swallow. And as tears are shed by the interviewees featured in the movie, tears are shed by the audience members as well.</p>\n<p>An emotional roller coaster and treasure chest of hard rock Cambodian tunes from the good ol’ days, “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten” is a well executed documentary that will appeal to just about anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and, most importantly, it will make you tap your foot to the beat of the beautiful songs featured in the movie.
