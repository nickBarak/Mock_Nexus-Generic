Neither did I until I watched “It.” Originally a TV-miniseries, this faithful adaptation of the book by Stephen King will leave you keyed up and on edge throughout its three-hour run time. “It” is a thriller-mystery following seven kids and later seven adults as they try to come to terms with supernatural events surrounding a killer clown named Pennywise. Ghouls and terrifying creations abound, and the movie’s theatrics are sure to make you look down every drain and up every spout. And, if you are worried about the movie running late, don’t worry. You’re not going to be sleeping anyway. Note: Coulrophobia refers to fear of clowns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9 Hours to Midnight —</strong> <strong> “The Conjuring” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>Released with the likes of “Carrie” (2013) and “Dark Skies” (2013), “The Conjuring” is probably the best horror movie released in the four years since “Haunting in Connecticut” (2009). In spite of stiff competition and an atmosphere of rehashed movie topics in Hollywood, this movie has done wonders at the box office. Although the plot lacks in originality, the twists and the apparition makes this movie a must-see. Bone-chillingly fresh suspense keeps the pace of the movie onwards. Pro Tip: Conjure yourself an extra pair of pants before watching; you will need them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16 Hours to Midnight — “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>It’s with happy <em>schadenfreude</em> that I present to you “The Hills Have Eyes.” Set in the Mojave Desert, a family of seven are hunted by a group of mutants looking for flesh and blood. This slasher/psychological thriller shocks the mind with grotesque violence and moments of adrenaline-fueled mayhem. Like any good horror movie, it strains against the limits of civility and pushes away common decency in a terrible display of death. Note: <em>Schadenfreude, </em>a German term, translates to “harm joy,” or pleasure at another’s misfortune.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12 Hours to Midnight — “The Blair Witch Project” (1999)</strong></p>\n<p>Arguably the film that created the ‘found films’ genre of horror, “The Blair Witch Project” is a cult film in its own right. Its plot centers on a group of college students who enter the Maryland forest with cameras to track down the legendary Blair Witch, only to disappear. An investigation ensues and the main evidence discovered is the cameras. The story and unknown forces that haunt these students all add to the film’s scariness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8 Hours to Midnight — “The Shining” (1980)</strong></p>\n<p>How many times have you heard someone make a reference to this film in the last week? One time? Two times? Five times? This movie has thoroughly infected the horror genre’s consciousness. Led by legendary film director, Stanley Kubrick, this Stephen King novel-adapted movie is about a couple and their young son taking a winter vacation up in the Colorado mountain ranges to manage the Overlook Hotel. The story, albeit very unfaithful to the original novel, nevertheless haunts audiences throughout the world in its depiction of the Overlook Hotel. The characters are strong and the setting isn’t lacking in creepiness. The lack of detail and resolution sets a mysterious vibe that is difficult to shake off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4 Hours to Midnight — “Mama” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>“The Ring” (2002) meets “The Grudge” (2004) in “Mama.” Directed by master of horror Guillermo del Toro, “Mama” is about two girls that are discovered in a cabin in the woods four years after their father abducted them. Their uncle and his girlfriend take them in as adopted daughters, only to find that something else has also been invited in as well.</p>\n<p>“Mama” has a moving plot and a great character cast. Far from being simple props that get horribly slaughtered, the characters elicit sympathy and pity for their misfortunes. Of course, like any horror thriller, the tension is racked up constantly in the melancholy setting. Note: “Game of Thrones” fans, if you ever wanted to see Jaime Lannister take on creepy ghosts, then this is the film for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Midnight — “Silent Hill” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the video game that sparked the genesis of the Western horror genre, “Silent Hill” is responsible for multiple game adaptations, including one produced by Guillermo del Toro expected to be released in 2016, and another movie sequel, “Silent Hill Revelations” (2012). Not to be confused with the slasher-thriller, “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006), “Silent Hill” (2006) is about a mother who takes her adopted daughter up to the mountains of West Virginia. In her journey, she accidentally ventures into an otherworldly, surrealistic dimension, to find her daughter in Silent Hill. Full of occult-ish creatures, pyramid men and dead nurses, this movie is chock full of frightening twists and turns that will leave you unable to stay still. The visual special effects are spot-on and the atmosphere is sure to haunt you on foggy days. Take this journey down Silent Hill and you’ll never regret it — until you can’t sleep, of course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through this journey, I hope you learn all the twists and turns of your deepest nightmares. No doubt, if you follow this list, you will find yourself screaming in terror. Try not to regret the nightmares or the creepy feeling of being watched that will undoubtedly follow — be one with your dark passenger.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Choi will be watching all of these movies in the dorms of Montecito House. He suggests you knock three times, pause, then knock again to be invited in.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/","id":6052,"author":{"id":753,"name":"Jon Choi"},"related":[6051,6050,6049],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scorsese’s “Mean Streets”: Screenwriter Comes to Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"INSIDE PERSPECTIVES: SCORSESE is part of a film series curated by UCSB faculty that focuses on the work of a specific director every quarter.

This quarter centers on the early works of director Martin Scorsese. Affectionately called the “John Lennon of the filmmaking industry,” Scorsese is one of the most influential directors and screenwriters in Hollywood. Some of his more recent credits include “Hugo,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Shutter Island.” The first event on Oct. 16 screened “Mean Streets,” followed by a post-screening Q&amp;A with screenwriter Mardik Martin and the producer of “Baghdad to Hollywood,” Ramy Katrib.</p>\n<p>With the combination of both a convenient location and the prestige of Scorsese, I expected the seats in Pollock Theater to be completely packed with eager and excited UCSB students. I was wrong. The audience, occupied by mostly middle-aged men and women and a handful of college students, barely filled Pollock’s 296 seats. Perhaps it would be a different story if the screenwriter of “Orange is the New Black” came instead.</p>\n<p>Martin and Katrib were introduced in the front of the room in standard procedure, after which the announcer commented, “Be prepared to ask some very, very provocative questions of Mr. Martin at the very end.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Originally from a rich family in Iraq, Martin moved to New York City penniless to avoid the draft and study at New York University. There, he met Scorsese and the two began to write and work on projects together. The other guest of honor, Katrib, is the producer of “Mardik: From Baghdad to Hollywood,” a film on Martin’s life and journey towards the American film industry.</p>\n<p>“Mean Streets” (1973) is a crime film that focuses on the difficulty of keeping morals straight in the midst of the sin and corruption of New York City. Main character Charlie, played by Harvey Keitel, must make a tough decision in choosing between his epileptic girlfriend Teresa (Amy Robinson), his self-destructive friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) or his dream of becoming an esteemed restaurant owner. At the end of this emotionally gripping movie filled with vigilantism, Charlie realizes that it no longer matters what decision he makes — he is a sinner no matter what.</p>\n<p>After the screening came the so-called provocative questions. After being asked how the artistry of storytelling has been advanced tremendously by the motion picture industry, Martin offhandedly responded, “That is an interesting question. I don’t think that I can answer that. 1932-62 was when the storytelling was actually magic. I still don’t know how it’s going to be solved.”</p>\n<p>It was rare and refreshing to see a renowned screenwriter admit that he didn’t know the answer to all the questions. He then humorously added, “I think its clear when you think about it. Feature filmmaking. This has been completely taken over by monsters, bloodsuckers and sons of bloodsuckers.” The audience erupted into laughter.</p>\n<p>He was asked more questions about whether the industry is focusing on films that are safe and financially successful rather than artistic: once again, a truly thought provoking question with no concrete answer. Martin responded, “I don’t know. If I did know, I wouldn’t be sitting here! I would be out here making a film!” The audience laughed once more, either confused or charmed by his honesty. Ten minutes before the end of the event, Martin noticed the drowsiness in the audience and amusingly told us all to go home.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s his old age or maybe he actually didn’t know answers to the questions, but from what I gathered at Pollock Theater, Martin doesn’t take himself too seriously. Breaking the stereotype that all filmmakers and screenwriters are pretentious and self-absorbed, Mardik Martin was a breath of fresh air. Funny and candid, he was not afraid to admit that even though he is a successful screenwriter, he doesn’t have to know everything.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/","id":6045,"author":{"id":746,"name":"Erika Lee"},"related":[6044,6043,6042],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academy Award Winning Actress Diane Ladd Reminds UCSB to Fight For the Arts","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Thursday, Oct. 23 UCSB’s Pollock Theater was filled with film connoisseurs anxiously waiting to see award-winning actress Diane Ladd on the big screen and in person.

The room was overwhelmed with applause as we watched her name appear on the screen before witnessing her performance as Flo in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 film “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” Her on-screen delivery moved our hearts as expected, but it was her off-screen words of advice that challenged our minds.</p>\n<p>Ladd is a three-time Oscar and Emmy nominee and has earned an Academy Award for her many performances in film and television. She’s an accomplished actress, writer, director and author in addition to being a loving wife and mother. Her film résumé is untouchable and her roles are countless, but none of us can forget her performance as Flo in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Ellen Burstyn as Alice, a widow who travels across the country with her son in hopes of pursuing a singing career and starting a new life. Along her journey Alice meets Flo, played by Ladd, a rebellious waitress who serves meals with a side of sass. From telling Alice that unbuttoning her shirt will get her more tips to forcing Alice to woman up and make a decision, Flo is the friend that keeps it real and keeps us laughing. It’s no wonder Ladd won the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress for the role.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After watching the film, the audience rose to their feet to applaud the accomplished actress and welcomed her to the stage for a little Q&amp;A. Her charming Southern accent and witty speech wooed us again as she told us stories about her life and experiences working in the film industry. She told us about how she surprised the world with the miraculous birth of her daughter Laura after doctors told her it would be impossible. Laura Dern went on to follow in her mother’s footsteps and the two actresses have worked together in films such as “Wild at Heart” (1990) and “Rambling Rose” (1991).</p>\n<p>When asked what working with Martin Scorsese was like, Ladd replied, “Marty is one of the greatest directors that I have ever worked with before in my life.” She talked about how great it was working with a director who loves you because the director-actor relationship is like a marriage. “Marty’s a New York director and with New York directors, you don’t talk with them til’ after lunch!” she joked.</p>\n<p>Ladd and her daughter Laura work hard to bring back roles for women. “It’s very hard to get the men in the profession to read a film script written by a woman, especially one who is an actress,” she confessed. Ladd is working with Scorsese again in her upcoming film “Woman Inside,” which tells the story of Martha Mitchell during the Watergate scandal.</p>\n<p>Meeting Ladd and hearing her speak was truly an inspiration. The first thing she said to me after the Q&amp;A was that she liked my dimples and that her mother used to tell her that dimples were a sign that the angels kissed you as a baby! Could she be any sweeter?</p>\n<p>Her humor and kind spirit attest to her humility, her talent is unmatched and her passion is raw.

Needless to say, I didn’t really know the plotline or what to anticipate. But as a fan of David Fincher’s work (“The Social Network,” “House of Cards,” “Fight Club”), I knew it had to be good. After watching it, I can say that it is as good as, if not better than, any Fincher film.</p>\n<p>“Gone Girl,” based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, is a beautifully frightening film that tells the story of the complicated marriage between Nick and Amy Dunne, played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. The film centers on the mystery behind Amy’s unexpected disappearance on their five-year anniversary. As part of an elaborate scheme for revenge on her cheating husband, Amy disappears and leaves clues that frame Nick as a murderer.</p>\n<p>Nick has no idea where his wife has gone, but as more clues are revealed, they point to the idea that he had something to do with her disappearance. The police continue to investigate further and everybody in town starts to believe that Nick is responsible for the murder of his wife.  Throughout the film, he tries to piece together the reasons behind Amy’s disappearance while trying to prove to the world that he is innocent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Things get more and more complicated as events unfold and the truth comes out.  Filled with deception and suspense, “Gone Girl” will definitely keep you sitting at the edge of your seat and have you whispering, “what the fuck,” quietly to yourself at the ending.</p>\n<p>Before I spoil the movie even further, I’d like to share the lessons that I have learned from watching “Gone Girl”.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h3>You can’t force love onto somebody.</h3>\n<p><strong>“</strong>Gone Girl” paints painfully relatable scenes that depict the extreme bliss of beginning a relationship, followed by the desperate great lengths people are willing to go to save a relationship when it starts to fall apart. What we should all learn from Amy Dunne is to <em>not</em> do what she did.</p>\n<p>While she was a beautiful, intelligent and extremely cunning character, she was also mentally troubled, soulless and vengeful. It is heartbreaking for a person to let go of the significant other that doesn’t love them anymore, but manipulation and trickery are not the way to force the relationship to keep going.  Her plan may have been successful, but it could never happen in real life.</p>\n<h3>There are two sides to every story.</h3>\n<p>In the beginning of the movie, the audience is not given the full story. All signs point to Nick as the murderer and Amy as the victim. But when the film reveals Amy’s agenda, everyone stops hating Nick and starts to sympathize with him.  In the end of the story, the media and the townspeople are convinced that Nick and Amy are the perfect couple, not knowing the real truth about their relationship and the lies that they both told.</p>\n<p>Just like real life, it’s easy to make assumptions about people or situations after hearing only one side or source, especially when one is a close friend.  People are often biased and the only way to figure out the full, accurate story about anything is to ask everybody involved.</p>\n<h3>You should never alter yourself to fit someone’s mold of what is cool.</h3>\n<p>Amy tried really hard to become her husband’s idea of a perfect woman, whom she labels the “Cool Girl.” The Cool Girl is a “hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes and burping; who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth while somehow maintaining a size 2.”</p>\n<p>She’s the type of girl that’s “understanding, never gets angry and only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.”  Amy later admits that that type of girl doesn’t exist and that she never felt like she could be herself. She may have been a sociopath, but she serves as a reminder that altering yourself to please others never ends up well.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/Ym3LB0lOJ0oframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Ym3LB0lOJ0o\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Such casual humor should be expected of any 40-year friendship, especially when it involves Barry, creator of the comic strip <em>Ernie Pook’s Comeek</em> and author of several novels, and Groening, best known for his comic strip <em>Life in Hell</em> and cartoon sitcoms “The Simpsons” and “Futurama.”</p>\n<p>The event, arranged by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, attracted a crowd of several hundred. Audience members ranged from young children to elderly couples, most in semi-formal attire. The huge theater walls were bedecked with balconies and lanterns to resemble the exterior of Spanish Mediterranean buildings. Depthless black covered the ceiling, and one could easily picture themself in a tranquil nighttime courtyard — at least, until the show began.</p>\n<p>First came iconic clips of the Simpsons and their antics: Bart showing Lisa his (accurate) illustrated prediction of their father being crushed by a garage door, Homer hurtling down a hill on skis as mounds of snow striked his groin and the entire family suffering epileptic seizures induced by a Japanese cartoon. The audience was roaring with laughter before Groening and Barry even took their seats in a corner of the stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The friends began their talk by recounting details of childhood. Barry described her Filipino grandmother, who sang in the kitchen and told far-fetched tales of monsters that attacked misbehaving children. Groening discussed how his family members influenced his most renowned characters. While cycling through a wealth of family pictures — taken by his father, a professional photographer — Groening revealed that Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie and Abe Simpson were named after his real life father, mother, sisters and grandfather, respectively.</p>\n<p>The discussion shifted to Evergreen State College, which the cartoonists both attended in the ’70s. Barry described the Oregon school as a liberal place where “everyone thought hippies would be around forever.” Groening first met Barry in college, upon learning that Barry had received a reply after writing to <em>Catch-22</em> author Joseph Heller, one of Groening’s favorite writers. The cartoonists recalled a number of their college exploits, from Barry’s temporary work as a nude model to Groening’s position as editor of the school paper, where he announced he would print “anything anyone wanted.”</p>\n<p>From there, Groening and Barry started talking about their artistic work. Barry, an experienced art teacher, encouraged artists and writers to work by hand rather than computer, because hands don’t have delete buttons. She played a video, showing lines drawn by a child juxtaposed with those drawn by Picasso in an abstract sketch and those drawn by a “physics dude” in a diagram. Barry insisted that such lines were alike in that they were all created by people getting ideas.</p>\n<p>Barry then showed the hilarious (but not entirely unrecognizable) results of her adult students sketching Marge Simpson for a minute with their eyes closed, to prove that adults who’d stopped drawing for years could still find joy in creating art. Not to be exempted, Groening and Barry made their own blind drawings on stage. Groening joked that he would sell his fairly accurate representation of Marge for five dollars, as Barry cackled at her own flawed attempt.</p>\n<p>While Barry leaned back in her chair feigning boredom when it was Groening’s turn to talk, and Groening laughed loudly at Barry’s humiliating stories, it was easy to see that this was a lasting friendship. The cartoonists ended their effortless exchange with an emotional hug, which might have lasted longer if they hadn’t reserved time to answer questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>The first question came from dedicated fan Matt Wallace, who asked if he could buy Groening’s drawing. Wallace, proudly displaying the sketch after the Q&amp;A session, stated, “I met Matt probably 20, 25 years ago … He was doing a book signing pre-‘Simpsons.’”</p>\n<p>Lucky, who at age 10 was the youngest audience member to ask questions, said one of her teachers “claimed” to have dated Groening’s father. Though a stunned Groening couldn’t confirm the statement, Lucky said of the event, “It’s really cool because I always watch ‘The Simpsons,’ and [once I] was Lisa for Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Fans old and new left the Arlington Theatre laughing. That night Groening and Barry were living proof of the agelessness of friendship and humor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/","id":6038,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6037,6036,6035],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":15,"route":"/categories/artsweek/film-and-tv","highestPage":15}},"__N_SSG":true}
