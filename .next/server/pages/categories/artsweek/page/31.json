A market that was once controlled solely by major labels now boasts an eclectic mixture of artists that represent the many facets of society. Perhaps that is why Steven Vidal (Stwo), Thursday night’s man of the hour, was able to walk through The Hub and grab a drink 45 minutes before his set, without being noticed by one single person. The Internet has given successful online artists a valuable perk, the option to remain anonymous. While the name Stwo may be recognizable, the face generally isn’t. But this should thrill music fans, as, for the first time ever, pockets of the music industry are being pushed completely by the music. Vidal put on a brilliant show Thursday night, not because of a larger than life stage presence, but because of music that is simply put, good.</p>\n<p>Vidal may not have to worry about the same kind of groupie mobs that religiously consume the 10-foot radius of a superstar like Kanye West. However, Vidal’s online presence will give an intrigued fan some fascinating information to latch on to. He hails from Paris, France and currently resides in Toronto, Canada, where he has formed ties with today’s hottest music label, the one and only, October’s Very Own.</p>\n<p>Drake’s right hand man and producer, Noah Shebib, known to many as “40,” reached out to Vidal after hearing his 2014 project, <em>92</em>. A mentor-protege relationship has since blossomed, providing Vidal with a priceless foundation, chock full of industry guidance and knowledge. OVO Sound Radio, the label’s newest project, has featured Vidal’s mixes on multiple occasions. It must be nice to have worldwide exposure at the push of a black and gold colored button.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A little SoundCloud digging reveals a gold mine of Vidal’s work, dating back three years. He clearly favors remixes. However, two EPs titled <em>Beyond</em> and <em>Moans</em> display his ability to create from the ground up. Both projects were released two years ago, and what listeners hear as amazing production is likely viewed by Vidal as child’s-play. Producers learn fast, and with someone like Noah Shebib providing direction, Vidal’s skills have undoubtedly improved drastically since 2014.</p>\n<p>Vidal played an hour-long set on Thursday for a handful of UCSB students hoping to escape the quarterly stresses that inevitably manifest around Week 9. Following the theme of his SoundCloud page, he blended a variety of work, from original tracks, to remixes, to untouched party jams. His mix included multiple Kanye West tracks, Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You,” and of course, some Drizzy Drake bangers. A couple remixed tracks that underwent the Stwo treatment included A$AP Ferg’s “Work,” 2 Chainz’s “No Lie” and Sango’s “Middle of Things, Beautiful Wife,” a crowd favorite which deservedly boasts four times as many SoundCloud plays as the original song.</p>\n<p>Although his show was all about the music, Vidal’s image was naturally displayed by the way he commanded the stage. He didn’t talk despite the powered on microphone stationed three feet away; he wasn’t tempted to use it until it was time to thank the crowd for their support. His clothing was no different than that of a typical UCSB student. Perhaps this is why he blended in so well amongst the crowd before his set. A 23-year-old rocking jeans and an OVO hat on a college campus doesn’t induce many double takes.</p>\n<p>All types of artists have their preferences when it comes to performing. Many musicians, especially DJs, insist on wearing headphones or in-ear monitors to hear with more clarity. Vidal chose not to. Whether the audience realizes it or not, a performer who is hearing the same exact sound through the same exact speakers at the same exact time is providing an indirect sense of organic connection. No headphones means no barrier between audience ears and performer ears. Vidal’s nonverbal behavior provided the audience bond that is typically achieved through talking.</p>\n<p>Stwo at The Hub was a special show because it caught a musician in the ripening stages of his career. Those who attended will certainly look at future “band-wagon” fans in a told-you-so manner. With 30 countries toured and counting, Steven Vidal has already built quite an impressive resume. Keep an eye on the Frenchman from The Six; he’s not done cooking yet.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68927\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68927\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/stwo-hits-the-hub/","id":6772,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6771,6770,6769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Odell Fox Folk it Up","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Thomas Mannell covers Americana at SOhO.

The parents caught up and chatted, the young adults brought their friends and dates and the little kids tried their best to maintain interest. The band — the reason for the get-together — sang comfortably, strummed confidently and spoke casually in front of an audience comprised heavily of their friends and friends of friends. As a friend of a friend myself, I was honored to be let in on this secret fan club, getting to speak with not only other sworn members but the band members themselves.</p>\n<p>Raphael Odell Shapiro, Jenner Snow Fox and their manager/fiddler/angel-voiced songstress Lauren Tronick played a lyrically driven, bluegrass selection of melodies. Between the three of them, they incorporated a harmonica, a violin, a mandolin, a classic acoustic guitar and a gorgeous Gretsch resonator into their repertoire. Fries got cold and beer got flat as the band captivated the crowd, jumping from solo works to unreleased material, comical songs to hard-hitting ballads and selections from their album to covers of their esteemed predecessors.</p>\n<p>The songs from their only album, <em>Moon Shiner EP</em>, were the most well-known to the crowd, as seen by the more dedicated fans unwittingly mouthing the words to hits like “Waiting Game” and “One at a Time.” Because of this, one would expect an aspiring, relatively unheard-of band with a fully stocked merch table set up in the back of the room to be pushing their album as much as possible. This was not the case. As Raph put it, “Songs are a very funny piece of art, because it’s something you create, and you have to play it over and over and over, and it’s not really good until you’re sick of it … and sometimes an older song will just catch you by surprise and be awesome.” Accordingly, some of the best songs of the night seemed to be the less tired-out ones not found on their album.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One such song was “GGD”, a skeptical plea with the clever lyrics, “I don’t give a good God damn because I know that God don’t give a damn about me” and “I ain’t no rabbi, buddhist, preist or pastor, but I know I got a tendency to preach.” This was immediately followed by an a cappella cover of “House of Gold”, a song so wholesomely Christian it could’ve been featured on the “O Brother Where Art Thou” soundtrack. This polar pairing left listeners unsure of what stance was being taken, or if a stance was even being taken at all. In fact, the only stance the band took very strongly the whole night was on the unquestionable superiority of Gatorade to Powerade in their aptly named song, “Gatorade.”</p>\n<p>As far as their future goes, the band’s next move is to finish their tour and set up a new home base in Austin, TX, one of the most prominent music meccas in America. They’ll spend a few months embedding themselves in the music scene there and will then return to the “boring” jobs they have when not on tour: guiding white water rafting tours down the Tuolumne River near Yosemite (Fox) and teaching at an art school and exploring in Alaska (Odell). They will begin touring again in July, starting at the Tall Tree Music Festival in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>Odell Fox, as demonstrated by their SOhO performance, had all the genuine charm of an underappreciated, up-and-coming band. No money-grubbing gimmicks. No ulterior agenda. No bullshit. Just a couple of good friends playing good music with a good attitude. The treasure-hoarding hipster part of me wants them to remain underground, eternally unknown and underrated except to a proud few. The pretentious hipster part of me wants them to blow up so I can tell everyone that I knew them first. But what I feel is truly amazing about Odell Fox is that they’ll enjoy themselves either way. As they put it, “even if you play shitty shows you’re at least on a pretty cool road trip with your friends.” They therefore must be feeling fantastic,­­ because their SOhO show was everything I could’ve hoped for and then some.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Their song “Let Your Youth Show” brought forth a dance wave in the audience with the coupling of a wistful chorus and melodic hook. The band’s enthusiastic personalities could be reflected onto their unicorn socks paired with Creepers to their playful banter with the crowd. Kid Cadaver’s electrifying performance was met with applause and off-pitch screams from all the alternative kids that had only came for HUNNY.</p>\n<p>The OC-based band Armors, the second band of the night, left me craving an espresso shot as the band began to lose their momentum in the midst of their set. Their sound replicated a “great value brand” Twenty One Pilots with a messy stylistic blend of electronic, rock and rap. Unfortunately, they just ended up sounding like pop chameleons trying to mask their indie pop sound in several genres. During the lull of their performance, I was attentive toward the sounds escaping the synth and keyboard player, Sam Beresford, who happens to be a UCSB alumnus. I suggest that he should commit a Zayn and leave his underwhelming band for his own good. Since the previous five-piece shrunk down to three, lead vocalist Olen simultaneously sang and drummed while standing up. They have the whole energetic sound intact, but the dark undertones ended up casting a spell on their genuine lightheartedness. Their song “Parasite” was the standout of their lengthy set list, the only part that roused me enough to wake up.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As HUNNY began to take the stage, the glitter-clad six-piece sauntered around each other and exchanged laughter when they hit the wrong chords. I spoke with an impatient Morgan McIntyre, who had recently seen HUNNY alongside the Neighbourhood last year.</p>\n<p>“HUNNY reminds me of all the rock influences I grew up on, and they all look like they just stepped out of Goodwill, which only adds to their whole ’90s bully aesthetic.”</p>\n<p>The ’90s bullies opened the show with “Natalie,” despite the heartrending profundity within this song, the combined background of the Velvet Jones’ faux New York skyline and lead singer Jason Yarger’s drunken slurring of “It’s been a week or 15, Natalie hasn’t said a word to me,” devoured the audience. Yarger crooned over the microphone with wine in one hand, only letting it down to begin his lurid guitar layering. During the middle of the set, after their performance of “Cry for Me,” Yarger threw his guitar on stage and took a one minute break to the bathroom, which left the audience in a state of confusion while the rest of the band continued with an extended instrumental. After HUNNY finished performing every song off their notable EP, they ended the set with new songs. Yarger kept profusely apologizing for the slew of new songs which had fans guessing at lyrics.</p>\n<p>The energy from the audience, hardly larger than 40 people, became immensely more fluid when the band belted out “Parking Lot,” an immaculate performance from Kevin Grimmett who provided stabbing synths. Yarger kept obnoxiously rocking the mic back and forth as I held out my right hand since death by a microphone falling on me is not one of the things on my bucket list. The intimacy of the venue allowed me to be sprayed in the face by Yarger’s spit during the “July” performance, possibly a pivotal point of my life. HUNNY’s fuse of slinky ’80s-style post-punk vocals, layered guitar riffs and genre-defying sound brings them a future of moving on from venues that have a capacity of 100 people to selling out arenas. My suggestion is to go experience an intimate, angst-ridden HUNNY show before they start selling tickets at a $60 price tag.</p>\n<p>Overall, the show was worth losing my hearing for about one hour after HUNNY wrapped up their performance and getting spit in my eye. I was faced with a revitalization for post-punk music, leaving me wanting to star in a ’80s movie with The Cure playing in the background.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6804,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6803,6802,6801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Olés Return to Isla Vista","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Finals season is fast approaching, and what better way to end a grim Winter Quarter than with an astounding show from Isla Vista’s very own The Olés.

The recently graduated Olés have acquired their own enticing twist on reggae and hip hop supplemented with some classic rock. The combination is typically hard to pull off, but it proves to not be a great challenge for this band. The Olés are not only verified on Spotify, but they have an overwhelming amount of supporters across the state of California. Aside from their numerous fan base, their music speaks for itself in a very humble form of musical complexity. Their California roots run deep; it is apparent in their sound, and it is what gives them the edge that most bands seek: a mixture of soft vocals and electric melodies that no other band could match. This is what drove a number of I.V. natives to jump at the chance to see them in action.<br>\nAfter recently embarking on their Southern California tour, members Matt Tweed, Cole Leksan, Daniel Kearney, Eric Lordan, Nicholas Marks, Dominick Burham and Westin Byerly made their return to the town of I.V. and were welcomed back with open arms. A Facebook invite created for the event went out before the show, and its attendees totaled nearly 1,000 people for this long-awaited concert. The buzz surrounding the show via word of mouth was immense compared to the typical talk of an Isla Vista concert or party. It is not rare for people to just come across a band they had not been anticipating in Isla Vista, but for The Olés, there was little promotion that had to be done because all of their fans were doing it for them. In the days approaching the show, it was not uncommon to be asked, “Hey, are you seeing The Olés this weekend?” or, “Yes, I saw the Facebook invite; I am definitely going!” The closer it came to the day of the show, the more the anticipation increased to finally see the band that everyone and their mother could not stop talking about.<br>\nThe show lineup included sets from Atomic Walrus, Zeek Beats &amp; Caleto and, finally, The Olés. Sueno, and of course Isla Vista in its entirety, filled with the upbeat, radiant sounds of the band that we all came to see. Like any other Saturday night, you saw drunk people flinging their limbs in rhythms they hoped came off as dancing. Everyone was in sync with each other, and while their love for The Olés poured out of their hearts and lungs, the band reciprocated the feelings by giving their all to their performance. Whether it was the fact that the guys were incredibly in tune with each other or the fact that they were playing in the heart of the town they had a great amount of love for, it was one of the most emotional performances that an Isla Vistan could experience and the band would have the opportunity to play. Sober or not, there is no forgetting the union of the glowing lights with the gray smoke in the cold night that enhanced every chord and every vocal melody. Although nothing could beat seeing them where it all began, The Olés are stopping by Velvet Jones and a few other local venues, and it would be an understatement to say that they are worth checking out. Do yourself a favor and catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/","id":6808,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6807,6806,6805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"MCC Screens ‘Very Young Girls’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/YOUNGIRLS-e1457052673719.png?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/YOUNGIRLS-e1457052673719.png?resize=350%2C448&ssl=1","description":"The only thing worse than knowing sex trafficking exists in this country is knowing the average starting age of girl prostitutes in NY (2007) was 13.

In some cases prostitution is voluntary — they’re escaping their home lives and are brainwashed into thinking it’s the best alternative — and sometimes they’re kidnapped. Unfortunately, underage prostitutes weren’t previously defended from being tried as adults. However, G.E.M.S. (Girls Educational &amp; Mentoring Services) was established as a shelter and an alternative to jail time for young girls subject to sex trafficking. “Very Young Girls” walks us through G.E.M.S. and the experiences of the young women affiliated with it.</p>\n<p>“Pimped over a hundred hoes; gonna find a new bitch.” Two pimps — unknowingly filmed for this documentary — take us through the business of teenage prostitution. From what I gleaned, it ultimately comes down to a three-step process: Drive around in a car looking for young girl on street, fill the girl’s mind with sweet nothings, sell girl’s body for a filthy income.</p>\n<p>Complementing the coverage of these pimps is an interview of Shaneiqua, who lets us see things from the victim’s perspective. She was involved in a very materialistic and sexual relationship, and her pimp was an astonishing 30 years older than her. He had her convinced that she had to sell her body to make him — or as he put it, “them” — more money.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In Shaneiqua’s case, and most others, sex trafficking comes down to brainwashing in the form of physical and verbal abuse. Pimps will fill the vulnerable minds of naive girls with the idea that they have to submit to this new lifestyle that will be mutually beneficial to them. The most tragic part of it all is that if girls try to escape — or if they don’t make enough money on any given night — they’re likely beaten.</p>\n<p>Even more cringe-worthy is that these girls aren’t only victims of their pimps, they’re subject to careless law enforcement. A worried LaSharon put flyers all over the city when her daughter went missing. Someone called, recognizing the girl in the photo, and told LaSharon where the girl had been seen, but her pimp and his men were all armed and dangerous. LaSharon went to police dispatch to ask for help, and the cop at the window literally looked her in the eyes and asked, “What do you want me to do?” The last thing we need is a police force that doesn’t give a damn about the issue.</p>\n<p>Not only did I shed tears for LaSharon, but for the mother of Nicole (15), who hitched a ride with a stranger, not realizing he was a pimp. She ended up sleeping with about 30 men in only four or five days, or six to eight men a day. She was charged for prostitution, and her mom wants to know why “instead of taking her to the hospital, they took her to the jailhouse.”</p>\n<p>Speaking of unfair judicial systems, men found sleeping with underage girls only pay a fine if the girls accepted money. These Johns, as they are referred to in court, won’t be charged as child rapists as long as they take a six-month break from repeating the offense, to which one offender responded, “When does this break start?” followed by unwarranted laugher. This scene frustrated me most. There were so many men in a courtroom — all charged for the same crime of having sex with minors — and none of them seemed to care about the disgusting issue to which they contributed.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, at G.E.M.S., Rachel Lloyd — who was sexually exploited herself — helps young prostitutes recover from sexual exploitation by providing them with a home and a support system they can turn to instead of turning to the streets again. This helps defend the girls against one of the biggest double standards in which they are criminalized and their abusers are merely fined.</p>\n<p>It broke my heart to see the girls in the documentary say things like, “It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” in reference having sex with their pimps, or seeing them turn back to the streets because they were too emotionally attached to their abusers. Lloyd and the other employees at G.E.M.S. work to make the girls realize they aren’t just “hos;” they have abilities beyond pleasuring strangers for money.</p><div

vernacular of outdoor sport culture, is defined by Urban Dictionary as, “when you’ve gone beyond radical, beyond extreme, it’s balls out danger.” The Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour was far beyond radical and far beyond extreme. Showing the best of the best cinematography of the Banff Film Festival that takes place in Canada every year, the Banff Film Festival World Tour made a stop at the Arlington Theater downtown Tuesday and Wednesday, February 23 and 24. This epic event was hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures for the 25th year in a row, and showed 17 short films and film excerpts demonstrating intense outdoor adventures.</p>\n<p>Two thousand people, notably decked in Patagonia, The North Face, various flannels and puff jackets, snaked around the Arlington waiting to take their seats. This crowd was stoked to say the least. Families, large groups, small groups, teenagers and everyone in between all shared the same sense of adventure, which connected all 2,000 of us together.</p>\n<p>Most of these people were Banff veterans anxiously awaiting more adventure in their lives. While waiting in line, I spoke to a man dressed in sandals and a blue Hawaiian button-up shirt who said that he’s attended the tour every year that it has stopped in Santa Barbara. “It’s always entertaining,” he said, “I like the mountain culture aspect of it.” He recounted films that were shown years ago, that kept him on the edge of his seat then, and clearly left a huge impact on him, as he remembered the audience’s reactions and how the footage made him feel. When I asked about how the films have changed over time, he stated that instead of seeing “a Miller ski scene,” as he described it, we now see more complex but still exciting cinema.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>All 2,000 local community members and students alike were exceptionally eager to get inside, and finally the line started moving. We inched below the red marquee and into the foyer. There, UCSB Adventure Programs, a sponsor of the event, was tabling and giving out the recycled pens and the orange-yellow ombré stickers that we students know so well. We filed in to take our seats, chatter filled the auditorium, the lights dimmed and it was showtime. A reel of the event’s sponsors played and when the advertisement for Deuter backpacks was presented, the audience simultaneously yelled a German phrase like it had been rehearsed before the show. I still don’t quite know what it meant or where it came from, but it really showed how connected, involved and allegiant the audience of this film tour was.</p>\n<p>An introductory video of the tour played, and with every breathtaking image or death-defying stunt that played on screen, you could hear gasps coming from every corner of the building. Literally the only word going through my mind was “woah.” It was only five minutes into this thing and I was already speechless. I suddenly knew why all these people continue to come back year after year.</p>\n<p>We were eventually greeted by Shauna Strain, who works for the festival, who introduced us to all the films throughout the evening. Out of the 65 movies made and shown in the festival in Banff, 17 of the best competitors were able to go on tour.</p>\n<p>The first film of the night was a short special edit of “Paradise Waits,” a film made about free skiing and big mountain skiing. The piercing imagery of this piece, the upbeat music and the humor really set up the night and got everyone settled in for an awesome time.</p>\n<p>Cinematic masterpiece after masterpiece played, each being just as, if not more, stunning as the last. These films captured the spirit of mountain culture and raw adventure. Crystal-clear imagery never left the screen and constantly captivated the audience. The vivid colors of our natural world saturated the eyes of everyone there. Mixtures of blues from either the sky or ice, and deep greens from the trees or the salamanders from “The Last Dragons,” a film covering conservation efforts happening on the East Coast, filled the room. Depicting scenes of rock climbers defying the odds, ice climbers challenging themselves in new ways, paragliders breaking new records or tour guides in China introducing local children to the wonders of nature, these films provided something for everyone. These stunts were unbelievable, and had the crowd at the edge of their seats. There were even a few, “Oh shits!” interjected throughout the evening from the gentleman sitting to my right. Yet, if I had to pick a favorite, the special edit of unReal” was by far the most exciting film to watch. Telling the story of a group of mountain bikers, this slow-mo, yet action-packed movie gave me a whole new respect for mountain biking, and was filmed right here in California. The good news is that you can find all of these films online on the Banff Film Festival website.</p>\n<p>But alongside these astonishing images of the planet was always a lesson to be learned. Many of the movies focused on the ways that we can help conserve and preserve the natural beauty of this world. These stories shared eye-opening facts about environmental degradation happening all around us, and the scary, yet true, repercussions we may face if we continue to live our lives this way. These films showed us the magnificence and power of our planet and all of the precious gifts it has to offer us, because without the wilderness we would not be able to partake in any of these outdoor sports or excursions.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Roman Baratiak, the associate director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, who had been putting on this event for each of the 25 years it has been in Santa Barbara. He said that the main goals of this film festival were to share a love and appreciation for nature, a sense of environmental consciousness and of course, having fun. These goals were most definitely achieved, as everyone left the theater ready to learn more about people and the planet, and start new adventures of our own.</p>\n<p>We should all try to connect more with the planet, whether it’s paragliding through the Canadian Rockies or hiking to Inspiration Point. So get outside, grab some grub, pack up the Subi and go shred some gnar.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

electronic music festival is invoked, a number of images are generally called to mind: booming bass music, fuzzy leggings and, perhaps, some night clubbers on a weekend getaway. On Memorial Day Weekend, May 20 to 25, Lightning in a Bottle will be shedding almost all electronic festival stereotypes in an effort to reimagine the festival experience.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the California-based production company The Do LaB, Lightning in a Bottle will be celebrating its 16th birthday this year in the scenic central coast town of Bradley, CA. The Do LaB’s main goal is to tackle the music festival experience with a mind for showcasing visual arts, curating immersive workshops, promoting environmental sustainability and, of course, offering the best in alternative electronica. If you haven’t made the pilgrimage to LiB before or are on the fence, listen up.</p>\n<p>One of the big draws of LiB is the sheer number of world-renowned minds that come to host lectures and workshops. The Temple of Consciousness will offer yoga sessions, discussions on spirituality and the occasional musician. If you find yourself working up an appetite from an early morning meditation session, your next destination will be The Learning Kitchen, which offers a host of various nutritional workshops and the necessitated tasting samples.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At LiB music is less the main attraction and more of a conduit for creating a transformative festival experience. However, the festival still manages to boast one of the most impressive lineups in the indie electronic scene. LiB will be headlined by festival circuit veterans Chet Faker, Grimes, Big Gigantic and Jamie xx. The undercard is also sporting a number of big bass acts in the form of Mija, G Jones, Four Tet and Hayden James. If you’re looking for a divergence from the typical festival formula or even just an early summer vacation, Bradley, CA on Memorial Day weekend is the destination for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

On Tuesday, March 1, Odell Fox is coming to SOhO in the second-to-last leg of their first tour ever. At 7:30 p.m., you can witness Raphael Odell Shapiro and Jenner Snow Fox soothe the soul and convince your parents that not <em>all</em> of our generation’s music is trash.</p>\n<p>Shapiro and Fox share a love for acoustic singing-songwriting, the great outdoors and “the next great American sport,” Spikeball. Moreover, as recent college graduates, they share the experience of stumbling out into the big bad world and giving it a go. Conveniently for us Gauchos, they have worked their newfound knowledge into their first EP, <em>Moon Shine</em><em>r</em>, a bluegrass-based, Americana armada of passionate tunes. With songs like “Waiting Game,” and “One at a Time,” they reflect on the shared dream of many twentysomethings that are abandoning the sedentary nine-to-five “successful” waiting game to welcome the struggles of following their passions and taking each step one at a time.</p>\n<p>The two met at Yale, where Fox was recruited to play collegiate soccer and Shapiro was recruited for musical theatre. The two eventually crossed paths in the Yale folk roots chorus, Tangled Up In Blue, where they toured together for three years and then went their separate ways. Shapiro began touring in an a capella group, the Yale Whiffenpoofs, and then graduated with the most folk-favoring degree a college boy can get: American Studies, focusing on cultural history and American storytelling. Fox graduated with the most scientific music degree possible: Cognitive Science, focusing on music and the mind. Shaprio moved to New York to make it big as an actor and Fox moved back to Oregon to work in the family business as a river tour guide. They each released their own solo album and something must’ve clicked because in less than year they decided to relive their days as Yale boys. In their unique case, this meant making folk music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just last winter, they got serious about their whole “dropping everything and making it as a musician” thing and moved in together in Palo Alto at Jenner’s parents house.

Sunday and Monday nights.</p>\n<p>The backdrop transitioned from blue to amber behind dozens of speakers stacked up, as if prepared for a rock show. But the music seemed to emanate directly from the instruments themselves. Kayhan Kalhor, an internationally known musician, slowly began playing the kamancheh, an Iranian stringed instrument. After four minutes of solo play, more than 20 members of the ensemble picked up their violins, clarinets and bass, adding to Kalhor’s skillful strumming.</p>\n<p>Ma was the last person to begin playing, and while many of those in the audience likely came to see him, it was members of the ensemble who were front and center for much of the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cristina Pato, bagpipes player for the Silk Road Ensemble from Galicia, Spain, said that “In Galicia, playing bagpipes is like playing soccer — you only have two choices.”</p>\n<p>She said that in the United States, many refer to Hispanic women as simply “Latina,” rather than focusing on their accomplishments or profession.</p>\n<p>“In Galicia, I was known as the Galician Bagpiper,” Pato said. “When I moved to the U.S., I was called Latina.”</p>\n<p>Then she burst into a song, filling the theatre with the high-pitched screams of her bagpipe as she swayed her hips and danced around the stage. The clarinetist gyrated, swinging from side to side and looking at his fellow musicians with emphatic smiles. Many of the other musicians also danced and moved around while playing, but Ma simply focused on his cello with serious ferocity, surely knowing that the audience’s eyes were flying back to him after every measure.</p>\n<p>This seriousness was contrasted at one point by a man who began using his own body for percussion, slapping his thighs, chest and at one point his buttocks, resulting in a scream from an elderly woman next to me.</p>\n<p>During one brief break from the music, a violinist said that the ensemble loved coming to Santa Barbara because of the dining options.</p>\n<p>“Musicians, they live for food,” he said. “We’ve been feasting on Lilly’s Tacos. We’re going to try and feed you back food for the soul.”</p>\n<p>When the audience returned from intermission, only four musicians took the stage, including a clarinetist, a cellist, Kalhor and Sandeep Das, who played the tabla — an eastern percussion instrument. Das went back and forth with Kalhor, challenging him with more and more complex rhythms.</p>\n<p>The instruments created such strong vibrations that it sounded like there were six musicians on stage even though often only three of the four were playing.</p>\n<p>Das said the quartet’s music was “about how we meet, about how we fall in love, about how we learn about each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>Later, the audience was rewarded as Ma took center stage with accompaniment from only Pato on the piano.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of heads stood still as they fixated on Ma’s masterful playing, his eyes closed, his hand viciously sliding his bow back and forth on the cello.</p>\n<p>The Silk Road Ensemble is releasing a new album, <em>Sing Me Home,</em> on April 22.</p>\n<div

murmured and mingled together for a night of Afro-Latin rhythms courtesy of Jungle Fire on Friday Feb. 19 in the Multicultural Center.</p>\n<p>Jungle Fire’s loud and stern chants from behind the red curtain trumped the muted conversations of the crowd, demanding a surge in energy that would come to characterize the evening. Chanting and clapping, the Los Angeles-based band emerged from behind the curtain and stationed themselves near one of the 13 glistening instruments positioned all over the stage before jumping into some tracks from their debut album, <em>Tropicoso</em>.</p>\n<p>Although the wedding band look of crisp, white button-ups, fedoras and five-o-clock shadows may be misleading, this 10-member collective knows how to keep the crowd out of their seat. While the band maintained a mild two-step throughout their performance, the fusion of 1970s funk and Afro-Latin dance rhythms moved the crowd beyond a simple two-step. Led by somebody’s father in the front row, the second the percussion instruments rang throughout the theatre, people whipped out some funky moves to the funk-filled tunes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The audience’s acceptance of the “Firewalker” artists’ dependence on instruments and an absence of lyrics illustrates that music is all about energy. The rattling of the West African shekere, the booming Cuban congas and piercing American electric guitar meshed together to create undeniable dance tunes for those from all walks of life. Santa Barbara resident Betsy Brenner praised such combinations.</p>\n<p>“I like the way the different rhythms come together, the drums with the cow bells,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the drums echoed throughout the theatre and the horns screeched, zebra-striped ponytails swung from shoulder to shoulder alongside hip-twisting neighbors. Everyone was connected through the complex fusion of Jungle Fire, unbothered by anything outside the rhythms.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara first-timers reiterate these sentiments of interconnectedness as they shared the development of their sound. One member shared that a particular song developed as they witnessed some children in an alley toying with a melody before allowing one of the guitarist to record their efforts, later transforming it to create their own track. Although there are no lyrics offering an explicit message, their blending of cultures through their sound and sources of inspiration conveys to listeners the positive interactions and feelings that arise when people embrace the fact that everyone is interconnected.</p>\n<p>While Jungle Fire steers clear of melodies, their special guest, Alan James, brought lyrics and powerful vocals to complement the soulful beats. As James bellowed, giving Bruno Mars a run for his money in the funk realm, he maintained the clapping ignited by the composers. Together, they bounced near the grounds symbolizing the breakdown in the beat before bouncing upwards with an increase in instrumentation to accompany James’ exclamations of “gotta get myself together, gonna get higher.” As James’ appearance came to an end, the collective directed more rapid clapping and declared, “it’s getting ready to be that time” before the lights dimmed to pink.</p>\n<p>As the show approached its end, the band aimed to leave the crowd in the highest spirits possible. Abandoning their two-step, the groovy group entertained an occasional jump and clink of drumsticks. The three percussion players stationed at the front of the stage maintained the excitement through their version of musical chairs as they bounced from one instrument to the next with the seemingly permanent smirks of all band members widening.</p>\n<p>While one concertgoer plopped down in her chair with her head dangling over, most attendees were able to drag themselves out of the MCC theatre and examine hard copies of the music that tired their bodies.

Theater as hundreds of necks twist around at once. “Just kidding,” the 20th Century Fox stooge says. Laughter across the board. Hey, they may have slaughtered the Fantastic Four, but at least they know how to market their shit.</p>\n<p>Then the screen goes dark and the comic book nerds shush their talkative neighbors. The film begins. “Angel of the Morning” plays and the film immediately lets us know what we’re in for as credits like “Starring God’s Gift to Man” and “Directed by Some Overpaid Tool” appear.</p>\n<p>Yup, “Deadpool” has arrived, a year and a half after I watched the leaked concept video during orientation. In its journey from CGI “what if” to Ryan Reynold’s flesh-and-blood crotch taking up most of the screen, the titular antihero has not lost an inch of his psychopathic charm.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is what anchors the film. Deadpool himself is impossibly hilarious. Nobody is safe from his sarcastic observations and scathing references. “Oh, your poor wife,” he moans after he punches the chrome colossus that is, well, Colossus in the balls. Ryan Reynolds has pitch-perfect delivery, although his performance is not all shits and giggles. There’s still enough emotional weight to his character that gives him motivation and humanity behind the burned casserole that is his face.</p>\n<p>That’s more I can say for the villain. Ajax (or Francis, as Deadpool vehemently insists on calling him) is about as interesting and amusing as a boiling pot of water. His only purpose is to provide Deadpool more material to work with. It’s a little disappointing that the film’s villain has absolutely no motivation, no good lines and, contrary to my friend’s insistence, has the sex appeal of roadkill. (Then again, aren’t all Marvel villains barring Loki like that?) It was a lot more gratifying to see Deadpool annihilate Rob Liefeld than watch these two mutants violently cross blades.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, you may be wondering: does “Deadpool” live up to its R-rating? Believe it or not, Marvel’s Netflix series actually seems gorier in comparison. That’s because whereas “Daredevil” treats its violence very seriously, “Deadpool” turns a man cutting off his own hand into a gag. But fear not, for there is definitely enough decapitations and blood to go around.</p>\n<p>As for the graphic nudity front, I can say that both boys and girls will probably come away turned on, but the women may have to look a little harder. Whereas the boobs are all well-lit thanks to the neon-pink strip club lighting, Deadpool’s wang is obscured in shadow. And, just saying, I only looked out for his dong for the sake of this review. I swear. Really. You should be thanking me.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful (yeah, lame transition, I know) that “Deadpool” is a riot. The jokes keep coming like a gift that keeps on giving. There’s such a wide variety of humor on display: satires of superhero movie tropes, parodies of John Hughes movies, Fawlty Towers references(!), incredibly violent slapstick and of course, a lot of penis humor.</p>\n<p>The movie’s humor, however, is not groundbreaking by any means. It still adheres to that annoying cliché of stopping the action and cutting out the music, which is basically the overpaid tool’s way of saying, “Laugh, goddammit, laugh.”</p>\n<p>Contrary to the marketing, the film is not a straight laugh train. Half of the time, both the movie and Deadpool himself steer into typical superhero melodrama. For what’s here, it works, but there’s not quite enough substance for my pretentious tastes. Deadpool has motivation, sure, but the villains don’t. The villains are there to look mean and act likewise. It’s a movie of halves.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean half the movie sucks; it’s undeniably entertaining. Deadpool is not the messiah of superhero comedy; it’s flawed, but it definitely takes advantage of its hard R to the best possible extent. The badass Merc with a Mouth is unashamedly immature and is all the more awesome for it. I definitely don’t regret waiting for an hour and a half for my ticket. Go see “Deadpool” and make it rain for 20th Century Fox.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/artsweek-reviews-deadpool/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/artsweek-reviews-deadpool/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/artsweek-reviews-deadpool/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/artsweek-reviews-deadpool/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/artsweek-reviews-deadpool/","id":5866,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5865,5864,5863],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF Women’s Panel","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CbHkgs9UcAAMZtH.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CbHkgs9UcAAMZtH.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The Women’s Panel was held in the Lobero theater on February 13th, the final day of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

The guests included Rosa Tran, Shannon McIntosh, Liz Garbus, Alison Eastwood, Svetlana Cvetko and Susan Cartsonis. They talked about their careers and the films they were being awarded for with moderator Madelyn Hammond. She created the panel and has been moderating it for thirteen years.</p>\n<p>Tran produced “Anomalisa,” a stop-motion film directed by Charlie Kaufman and received an Oscar nomination for her work. She described her progression through the industry: she went to film school, paying her way through as a manicurist. After working in reality TV, she became a writer’s assistant on Comedy Central and became a puppet coordinator for Robot Chicken. “Anomalisa” co-director Duke Johnson showed her the film’s script, convincing her to produce.       When asked about what was difficult about the production, Tran replied, -“[Keeping everyone together] was tough. There was someone crying her eyes out in the parking lot. You tell her she’s amazing and that this hasn’t been done before, and we’ll figure it out together.”</p>\n<p>Shannon McIntosh produced “The Hateful Eight,” working alongside Quentin Tarantino, whose enthusiasm she described as “infectious.” She is a former employee of pre-Disney Miramax. “I had a work ethic that was unparalleled for anyone who worked there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>McIntosh described how one of the greatest difficulties that came out of “Eight” was the fact that there were only around a dozen working 70mm cameras in the United States. As that was the format Tarantino wanted the film to be shown in, McIntosh had to scrounge together parts from other cameras in order to make sure there would be enough projectors to screen the film in.</p>\n<p>Garbus is a renowned documentarian. Her Oscar-nominated film, “What Happened, Miss Simone?” chronicles the life and career of jazz singer and activist Nina Simone. It was made over a period of 13 months and released on Netflix.</p>\n<p>When she was in high school, she made her own documentary and showed it at a party, where a PBS producer was in attendance. Afterwards, she studied film at college. A meeting with a prison journalist led her to Angola State Prison, where Garbus met and talked to ten inmates. The resulting documentary “The Farm: Angola, USA,” earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>Eastwood is the daughter of film legend and fellow director Clint Eastwood. -“My brother and I grew up on set,” she said. Her picture “Battlecreek” involves a romance between a girl and a boy with a skin disease.</p>\n<p>While watching the production of her father’s films, Eastwood felt a need to get involved in film. “I wanted to pay attention. I didn’t want to just sit around.” Ever since, she’s done, “… a lot of good movies, a lot of crappy movies. I learned what not to do. I wanted to produce and develop.”</p>\n<p>“Battlecreek’s” script had to be refined over the course of several months and re-started altogether when the original production fell apart. “The passion [keeps me going],” Eastwood said. The production was ultimately saved when someone wrote a check for the whole film.</p>\n<p>Yugoslavian native Cvetko works on films as a cinematographer. She started out as a camera assistant on a film set. Later, she went to India to make a short film, which was shown at Sundance.</p>\n<p>Like Gaarbus, Cvetko works on documentaries. “In [that] world, the team is very very small. Personal, tight.” Most crews are male, “but there are some amazing women kicking ass out there.” Cvetko says sometimes, she has to convince her male crewmembers that she is on their side.</p>\n<p>Cartsonis is the president of production company Storefront Pictures. She attended both UCLA and NYU, deciding she wanted to be a scriptwriter. She ended up getting a job reading scripts at 20th Century Fox, reading up to four a day.</p>\n<p>She went on to attract the attention of Scott Rudin, a film producer. After asking her to be his assistant, Cartsonis called him back and, at the urging of her boss, said, “I want to be an executive.”</p>\n<p>“Okay,” Rudin replied. Cartsonis gained the title of “Untitled Creative Executive,” later becoming a Senior Vice President of Production.</p>\n<p>Despite her high position in the film world, she described how it can sometimes be difficult to acquire funds to make films, something the other panelists agreed with. “You have to figure out the ways that are natural to you to ask for money.” She recently made “Carrie Pilby,” a Kickstarter-backed film.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the event, Hammond asked the filmmakers if they had any pearls of wisdom to share.</p>\n<p>Eastwood’s stood out the most: “If there’s something you want to do, do it. Visualize it. Do whatever you have to do to make it happen.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/","id":5865,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5864,5863,5862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF Director’s Panel","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara International Film Festival held the Outstanding Directors of the Year Award at the Arlington Theater on Feb. 11.

We’d been in the room for about a month. And we thought, “Great, it’ll be wonderful. We’ll have some space to work in and everything.” But actually it was challenging because I think we got really used to that environment in the studio, you know? And our lives were pretty regular, you know? When you’re shooting in the studio, you can arrive at a certain time and you can work the same hours every day. And then we [went] back out into the crazy world of the outside world. And I think we also sort of missed Room a little bit. And it was also cold. It was Canadian winter. So yeah, it was tricky.</p>\n<p>AW: Considering that Jack’s point of view melds with Ma’s unlike the book, did you find it difficult to imbue the movie with a sense of wonder and imagination?</p>\n<p>LA: I think that point of view was the biggest challenge in the whole movie. Inside Room, we sort of moved between being with him and being with her, and when we’re with him, I think the audience starts to feel more of that childlike tone, and when you’re with her, you feel the darker aspect of the place. So it’s challenging because you’re looking at what it’s really like, and that’s really intense. So to keep the magic can be hard, but I think we managed to do it.</p>\n<p>AW: How’s “Neverhome” going?</p>\n<p>LA: We’re still working on the script, so that’s a little bit down the line.

The director wrote a five page letter to the author of the novel, Emma Donoghue, upon which the film was based in an attempt to convince her that he was the right director.</p>\n<p>She did not agree right away, but became more convinced that he was the right choice after she saw his films. Donoghue would go on to pen the film’s script and be nominated for an Oscar herself.</p>\n<p>Abrahamson explained that he cast Brie Larson in the leading role because he felt she could easily bond with a child. Jacob Tremblay was cast only four months before principal photography began. Since he was still a young child, the crew didn’t want him to noticeably age as shooting went on.</p>\n<p>The director discussed how the titular room was built in Pinewood, the same studio in which “The Force Awakens” was shot. The set was small and cramped, making it difficult to shoot, but it was also intimate. “I was in the bath sometimes and popped up to give instructions at the end of scenes,” Abrahamson said.</p>\n<p>After him came Alejandro G. Iñárritu, director of “The Revenant” and last year’s Oscar winner for Best Director for “Birdman.” Cheers from the crowd standing outside the barriers heralded his arrival. On the red carpet, reporters swarmed the informally dressed Iñárritu as he walked into the Arlington.</p>\n<p>He explained what drew him to the story: “I saw some elements I really was attracted to, and one of them was the fact that there was a linear story in a very clear, simple way in what these men went through in this huge landscape and solitude. The simplicity of it in a way gave some opportunities [to] other things. I was curious about it. Because it was something I’ve never done before, it was terrifying.”</p>\n<p>Like in “Birdman” (which he described as a portrait of a suicide), Iñárritu worked with Emmanuel Luzbecki, who was also the cinematographer for “Gravity.” Iñárritu described him as “a chronic dissatisfied person” and was only as good as he was because “he has sausages and chicken for breakfast, or Mexican Coca-Cola,” which drew laughs from the audience.</p>\n<p>Tom McCarthy was up next. Feinberg asked him if his Catholic background made it difficult for him to take on “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>“No, it wasn’t. The information was so compelling,” McCarthy said.</p>\n<p>Besides being a director and writer, McCarthy also has some acting experience. He portrayed the ethically challenged reporter Scott Templeton on “The Wire,” and said the experience made him interested in journalism.</p>\n<p>In order to accurately recount the story of “Spotlight,” McCarthy and his co-writer Josh Singer met with multiple individuals involved with the case, both journalists and victims. One of them, abuse survivor Phil Saviano, was in the audience and received applause when McCarthy asked him to stand. Saviano filmed the rest of McCarthy’s talk with Feinberg on his phone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68300\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68300\" data-attachment-id=\"68300\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68300\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3-1024x684.jpg?resize=368%2C246\" alt=\"Tom McCarthy, director of Spotlight.

McKay is primarily a writer of comedies and noted he was aware of how surprising it was that he went from writing “Step Brothers” to making a movie about one of the biggest stories of the past half-century.</p>\n<p>The film came about when McKay’s agent, Phil Roberts, asked him if he could direct anything, what would it be? McCarthy replied that he wanted to adapt <em>The Big Short</em>.</p>\n<p>“Let me make a call,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, Brad Pitt’s production company, Plan B Entertainment, was asking him to direct (and Brad Pitt was asking to be in it). However, Adam Goodman, the head of Paramount, laughed in McKay’s face when he listed all the actors he wanted to cast.</p>\n<p>Despite this, McKay was able to bring in nearly everyone he wanted. For the scenes where the characters break the fourth wall, he cast Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez and Richard Thaler. He described Gomez as sharp and Thaler, an economist, as a “diva.”</p>\n<p>As for how the film was received publicly, McKay expressed joy at seeing people on Twitter saying that they didn’t know how to feel about his film. To him, that was a sign that he had made a thoughtful work. “The Big Short” was screened for Congress and was admired by progressives and conservatives alike.</p>\n<p>Finally came George Miller, director of “Fury Road” as well as the preceding three “Mad Max” movies. He had time for a single question.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68299\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68299\" data-attachment-id=\"68299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68299\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=368%2C246\" alt=\"George Miller, director of Mad Max: Fury Road.

Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>AW: What were the challenges of melding practical and special effects on such a giant scale?</p>\n<p>GM: Well, it’s very logistical. You need a huge team to do it. You need a lot of planning. So we were like an army. You’ve got to think of it like an army, except you’re not going to war, but you have to make sure everyone’s safe. You have to make sure everyone’s prepared, and in the execution, you’ve got to make sure you get it all in your camera. So it’s a big logistical exercise.</p>\n<p>Inside the Arlington, Miller didn’t discuss the film itself as much as he did his family and the nature of his franchise’s stories. “My mother recently asked me, ‘I thought after the ‘Happy Feet’ movies you were settling down. Now I’m not so sure.’”</p>\n<p>Miller also directed “Babe: Pig in the City.”</p>\n<p>“When you have kids, all you do is watch family movies,” Miller said. “Everyone loves those stories. And now that [my kids] are grown up, I can make more Mad Maxes.”</p>\n<p>The original “Mad Max” was shot in Australia on a small budget and released in 1979. It introduced the character of Max Rockatansky, played by Mel Gibson. The character has remained a staple of pop-culture since. “I wasn’t aware of it at the time, but somehow we tapped into a pre-classic archetype,” Miller said. He compared the “Mad Max” movies to American westerns.</p>\n<p>“What’s so seductive about ‘Mad Max’ stories is that they’re allegorical,” he said. “We can’t exist without stories. It’s how we make the world coherent.”</p>\n<p>Towards the end of his talk, Miller mentioned what has been one of the most surprising reactions towards “Fury Road” for him: “Someone came up to me and told me ‘I’ve just had a baby girl, and I called her Furiosa.’ And I thought, ‘Holy cow.’”</p>\n<p>To cap off the event, all five directors were brought out at once to talk to each other and continue answering questions from Feinberg.</p>\n<p>When asked how they met each other, McKay revealed, much to the assembled audience’s amusement, that Tom McCarthy was once his employee at RadioShack. During an altercation, McKay told his employee, “Goddammit Tom, this is RadioShack!”</p>\n<p>“Are you for real?” McCarthy replied. He promptly quit.</p>\n<p>As he left, McKay turned to his co-workers and said, “That’s a loser.” He continued to rib the good-natured McCarthy, joking that he didn’t care for “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>Abrahamson saw the film at Telluride. “There’s a level of understatement and naturalism. I sat back and thought, that’s the best thing of ‘70s American moviemaking.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68301\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68301\" data-attachment-id=\"68301\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68301\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of The Revenant.

All that atmosphere suddenly turns. The minimalism covers so many things that are so profound. George, when I saw ‘Mad Max’ I was exhausted. Every two seconds he cuts to another shot more powerful than another one. I was so upset with Adam when I finished [The Big Short]. I was so unsettled. Formally, I was very surprised, very shaken, very provoked. I am honored to be with these gentlemen.” Iñárritu also said the principle and victim actors from Tom’s movie were outstanding.</p>\n<p>The event ended when Andy Davis, director of “The Fugitive,” gave each director their “Outstanding Director of the Year” trophies.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/","id":5864,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5863,5862,5861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF Cinema Vanguard Award: Rooney Mara Interview","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_5168rooney-redcarpet.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_5168rooney-redcarpet.jpg?resize=463%2C550&ssl=1","description":"Clad in black leather and velvet open-toed pumps, the actress planted her feet on the cement of the Arlington Theater promptly at 7:30 p.m. on the bustling Friday night in downtown Santa Barbara.

Academy Award-nominated actress Rooney Mara arrived punctually at the 2016 Santa Barbara International Film Festival to receive her very own tribute award. As the 2016 recipient of the Cinema Vanguard Award, the 30-year-old succeeds past winners like Leonardo DiCaprio and Eddie Redmayne.</p>\n<p>For her contributions to the cinema in the past year, Mara is recognized for her work in the film, “Carol.” Based on the British romance novel, <em>The Price of Salt</em>, the film follows the love story between the divorced suburban housewife (played by Cate Blanchett) and an ordinary shop girl (Mara). The period drama revolves around the complex romance between two women from different backgrounds. Both Blanchett and Mara are nominated respectfully in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories. Having won the Best Actress Award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival in May of last year, Mara was a shoo-in to receive an Oscar nomination months before the nominations were announced in January.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a menswear-inspired ivory lace top and skirt, the young actress was accompanied by the film director before he presented her with the award on stage. In an exclusive <em>Daily Nexus</em> interview with Mara and the film director, Todd Haynes, the “Carol” duo shared a few anecdotes and memories:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bin Nguyen</strong>: What was it like filming the love scenes with Cate Blanchett?</p>\n<p><strong>Rooney Mara</strong>: Working with Cate was incredible. We have a very similar work ethic. It was really easy from the rehearsal period … It definitely clicked. She is very generous and I felt super comfortable with her and with Todd.</p>\n<p>BN: How did the period costumes help you transform into character?</p>\n<p>RM: Costumes in any film are always a huge thing with the character … It can change everything about the way you move, depending on whether you’re wearing [it] in a scene or what point of the film your character is in. Costumes, to me, are very important. Sandy Powell is an incredible costume designer, I just [wore] whatever she told me to wear.</p>\n<p>BN: What did you take away from filming “Carol” for your own life?</p>\n<p><strong>[Todd Haynes</strong> interjects]: You’re a lesbian now!</p>\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: [jokingly] Yes, yes I am … haha.</p>\n<p><strong>BN: </strong>Will there be more of Lisbeth Salander [Mara’s role in the “Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”] in the coming future?</p>\n<p><strong>RM: </strong>I believe there will be. Hopefully with me, but I really don’t know.</p>\n<p>After the “Girl with the Dragon with the Tattoo” actress finished all the interviews, she walked inside the theater to begin the night’s events. Mara and the interviewer of the night, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> correspondent Joe McGovern, both sat alongside each other and watched clips from her previous films, starting with her minimal but pivotal role in “The Social Network” all the way up to “Carol.” While appearing mildly uncomfortable watching herself on screen, the actress spoke of her fond memories working with directors David Fincher and Steven Soderbergh. A pre-taped tribute video by Blanchett played for the award recipient and the audience. The “Queen Elizabeth” actress praised her young co-star for her performance in film. At the final moments of the evening, Haynes stepped on stage to bestow his star with the Cinema Vanguard Award.</p>\n<p>Rooney Mara is a sensational actress who captures every screen that she is in. Her graceful demure and relaxed attitude is evident on and off screen. With only a few films and nominations under her belt, the young actress has the longevity of the likes such as Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. If she doesn’t win an Oscar for her performance in “Carol” this year, Rooney Mara will for sure win an Oscar in the definite future.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/","id":5863,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[5862,5861,5860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stephen’s Eclectic Sounds Take Over Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Few people watched as Tyson Leonard, the violinist and founder of the band Tropo, a man in a simple black T-shirt holding a violin, made his way onto the stage.

Although Tropo was originally a one-man band, Leonard was later accompanied by drummer Adam Kapuscinski and bassist Grant Leonard. Interestingly, their jazzy and classical rhythm is integrated with a lush synth, providing an electronic club atmosphere. As more people filled the room, a funkier and groovier tempo arose, causing the audience to start dancing, along with a soothing touch of vocals from Leonard, maintaining a relaxing rhythm. This portion of the show felt as if it was a Boiler Room session with Flume and Yo-Yo Ma. Despite the upbeat feel, Tropo lacked some of the interaction and performance expertise that was embodied by the subsequent performers.</p>\n<p>Upon gathering their various instruments, Tropo thanked Santa Barbara’s amazing crowd and made their way off stage. Throughout the intermission I overheard some conversations and managed to interact with a few of the audience members. Two young women told me their reasons for being at the show that night.</p>\n<p>“My friend and I were just looking for a place with good music and we came across this, we’ve never heard of any of these artists before,” stated one of the girls. Her friend then went on to explain, “We were just looking for good music, really, of any genre.” Although they were unfamiliar with the artists prior to the show, they both agreed that the music was surprisingly sensational.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup for the night was perfect for just that — anyone with an eclectic taste in music and a yearning for melodic jams.</p>\n<p>A skinny and tall young man approached the mic with high intensity. “Can we turn up? It’s fucking Saturday night!” yelled Lafa Taylor, the Oakland-based singer/emcee/producer. Throughout his career, Taylor has managed to find himself incorporating a variety of different genres into his music, leading to a unique artistic performance. Not only is the music that Lafa Taylor has to offer noteworthy, but he also has an impressive ability to engage the audience and leave them craving more. Taylor’s beats were so ardent that each time the bass dropped the venue shook and the crowd became invigorated and overcome by the music. “Y’all feel that shit!?” yelled the emcee. Although heavily influenced by trap, Taylor has managed to dig deep into the roots of R&amp;B and old-school hip hop, incorporating it into his setlist. People sang along as Ginuwine’s “Pony” came on and a nostalgic feeling emerged as Notorious B.I.G’s “Hypnotize” resonated through the loudspeakers, dispersing into the elated audience.</p>\n<p>Lafa Taylor’s “It’s all music” message pervaded his performance to emphasize that despite the wide genres of music exemplified, the ultimate goal was to play soulful music that would allow the audience to lose themselves in the music.</p>\n<p>After a long wait, Stephen finally took the stage, leading everyone to force their way even closer to him, ensuring a better view. Although Stephen gained much of his fanbase from the song “Bullet Train,” which he made back in 2013 while still in college. He has since transitioned into a somewhat new sound that has a much more genuine essence. Similar to a vast majority of other artists that create music without the intention to simply attain great wealth, Stephen has a relatively small fanbase. Every song was filled with a high level of intimacy due to all of Stephen’s music surprisingly being backed up by the singing of the crowd. Almost everyone in attendance sang the lyrics to every song he played, each time becoming more entranced with his words and the music. Nonetheless, this was not the only impressive element of Stephen’s performance, as he demonstrated his incredible knowledge of almost every instrument that surrounded him and as he not only sang, but also played the drums and guitar. “I’m gonna be real with you guys, that was probably the best I’ve ever played a guitar,” Stephen shared after he gave an astonishingly remarkable guitar solo. He went on to make it clear that he could, for a fact, play a rad drum solo — “Alright, before I leave I have to play the drums,” announced Stephen as he grabbed the drumsticks and had an intense drum-off with the original drummer. To finish off the show, Stephen performed a phenomenal live version of his cover of Adele’s “Hello.”</p>\n<p>The night was, in the words of Lafa Taylor himself, “A fusion of music, multiple styles mixed together!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/","id":6799,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6798,6797,6796],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":31,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
