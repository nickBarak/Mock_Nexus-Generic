Unlike Christmas or Halloween, holidays that generally everybody love, people either look forward to V-day or dread it completely. It’s one of the only days of the year where people need to prove to the world that another person loves them. Don’t love songs on the radio remind us daily of our relationship status, anyway? Whether you have plans to passionately belt sad Sam Smith lyrics to yourself or serenade your lover with a song this Valentine’s Day, make sure you get the lyrics right! These commonly misinterpreted lyrics of five popular songs from five different genres of music are ridiculous, hilarious and might lead you to never look at a song the same way again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sam Smith— “Leave Your Lover” (Soul) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Actual lyric:</strong> “Set my midnight sorrow free”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Misinterpreted lyric:</strong> “Suck my milk maid sour free”</p>\n<p>Both beautiful and heart-wrenching, “Leave Your Lover” tells the story of someone who is in love with somebody that’s already taken. He pleads his lover to leave the current affair, singing, “Pack up and leave everything, Don’t you see what I can bring? Can’t keep this beating heart at bay.” Smith’s raw and honest voice is filled with agony, leaving the listener heart shattered, until the next line, “Suck my milk maid sour free.” Although he actually sings, “Set my midnight sorrow free”, that’s not what you’ll be thinking of.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/182TRJq9Zt8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<li><strong> Taylor Swift— “Blank Space” (Pop) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Actual lyric:</strong> “Got a long list of ex-lovers”</p>\n<p><strong>Misinterpreted lyric:</strong> “Got a long list of Starbucks lovers”</p>\n<p>If you’re not tired of this song playing ten million times a day yet, listen closely to the lyrics. You might have heard your friends singing, “Got a long list of Starbucks lovers, they’ll tell you I’m insane,” but that’s actually not the correct lyric. T-Swizzle is actually saying, “Got a long list of ex-lovers.” As if Starbucks needed more publicity, right?</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-ORhEE9VVg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<li><strong> Missy Elliot— “Work It” (Hip Hop)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Actual lyric: “</strong>Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup I”</p>\n<p><strong>Misinterpreted lyric: “</strong>Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup I”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a fun throwback song to dance to or if you live under a rock and only recently discovered Missy Elliot after her Superbowl half time performance, “Work It” is for you. When you play the song, it’s all fun and games until she sings, “Is it worth it, let me work it / I put my thing down, flip and reverse it /Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup I /Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup I” If you lost her after she said “reverse it”, you’re not alone. Next time you pause at this part of the song because you’re so confused, don’t! It turns out that the gibberish millions of people failed to decode is actually just … gibberish. Because it’s the previous line backwards.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zm28EEeyLek?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<li><strong> Daft Punk— Get Lucky (Electronic) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Actual Lyric: “</strong>Like the legend of the phoenix”</p>\n<p><strong>Misinterpreted lyric: “</strong>Like the legend of the penis”</p>\n<p>Since 80 percent of the song is the line “We’re up all night to get lucky,” you’d think that it would be impossible to get any of the lyrics wrong.

In the chorus she sings, “Got me hopin’ you’d page me right now,” but what are pagers? Since most of our generation has not seen a pager, it seems more understandable that the lyric was confused for “pay.” But since Beyonce makes just as much money as Jay-Z, she probably won’t be asking for money anytime soon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViwtNLUqkMY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Happy serenading!</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-14/5-misheard-song-lyrics-from-5-different-genres/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-14/5-misheard-song-lyrics-from-5-different-genres/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-14/5-misheard-song-lyrics-from-5-different-genres/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-14/5-misheard-song-lyrics-from-5-different-genres/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-14/5-misheard-song-lyrics-from-5-different-genres/","id":7743,"author":{"id":746,"name":"Erika Lee"},"related":[7742,7741,7740],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Panel Highlights Male-Dominance in Film Industry","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=600%2C419&ssl=1","description":"The phrase “women in show business” conjures a variety of onscreen stereotypes: the distressed damsel, the young clandestine coquette and the sensual temptress, amongst others.

The cause for this can be traced off-screen, where a vast majority of filmmakers and executives are male. The film industry is notoriously difficult to break into, and for an industry that prides itself on progressiveness and liberal values, it is still staggeringly male-dominated in the year 2015. On Feb. 7, six successful women in show business formed the women’s panel at Lobero Theatre and made a dent in this norm, hopefully causing a ripple.</p>\n<p>Bonnie Arnold, Carolyn Blackwood, Kristin Hahn, Rory Kennedy, Aneta Kopacz and Kristina Reed answered questions about their recent films, as well as their careers and what it means to be a female filmmaker and producer. Not only was each woman successful in finding their way in a male-dominated profession, but each panelist told a story of how she enabled the image of a strong female figure either on the screen or in her own life.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a strong female archetype was exemplified in the films of Bonnie Arnold and Carolyn Blackwood, producers of “How to Train Your Dragon 2” and “The Hobbit.” While the “How to Train Your Dragon” book series is devoid of a strong female character, the filmmakers felt it was important to incorporate one into the film. Thus the role of Astrid, a fellow teenage Viking, was born. The role of Galadriel in “The Hobbit” also epitomized a strong female figure. Of Cate Blanchett’s character, Blackwood said, “she kicks a lot of ass” and this was “very, very intentional.” Arnold neatly summed up the need for this type of depictions when she said: “Boys and girls need to see women doing strong things, because if you don’t see it, you can’t even imagine it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kristin Hahn, producer of “Cake,” and Aneta Kopacz, creator of the short film “Joanna” chose to portray women as more realistic heroes in their films. In “Cake,” Jennifer Aniston and her producing partner (and spitting image) consciously decided to center the movie on a woman living with chronic pain, a demographic that is hardly ever portrayed in films. Kopacz tells the story of Joanna, a young mother she read about in an article who was diagnosed with cancer. Kopacz wanted to tell her story, focusing on the bravery and humor exerted in her everyday life with her son, rather than her terminal condition.</p>\n<p>A delightful high point was when Kristina Reed, who worked on the Disney short film “Feast,” a silent animation starring a puppy and a lot of food, went into detail about what goes into making a Disney short. As everything Disney, there are “big stakes and big budgets,” but also a more fun and inclusive attitude surrounding shorts. Everyone in the company, including the security guards and secretary, can pitch their ideas. The winning idea for “Feast” was inspired by an employee who was able to recount his past year through a full account of his 365 dinners using the 1 Second Everyday app. The short meal glimpses were able to tell stories of the year, such as when he was busy on projects and busy with celebratory occasions. Thus the food-based premise of the film was born.</p>\n<p>In contrast to aforementioned indulgent narratives, Rory Kennedy joked that her films range from “depressing to really depressing.” In line with her family’s legacy, she created a documentary recounting the last 24 hours of the Vietnam War. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and left the audience in tears. Kennedy began a career as a reporter, and didn’t think about becoming a filmmaker until she made her first documentary in an effort to expose the untold truth about pregnant women addicted to crack who often cannot find help, in spite of their condition.</p>\n<p>The end segment of the panel consisted of more humorous banter. While discussing the role of male mentors, Hahn chimed that they’re “especially appreciative if you make them look good,” to which Arnold quipped, “I hire that way now.” The cherry on top of the event was a parting gift of postcard sets each donning the countenance of historical women such as Frieda Kahlo and Maya Angelou. While the panel itself was certainly inspiring and uplifting, it would have been nice to see a hint of the racial diversity so prominent in the postcards up onstage.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60860\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60860\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/","id":6065,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6064,6063,6062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Partners in Crime” Sheds Light on the Truths of the Teenage Psyche","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Chang Jung-chi’s thriller is all about uncovering secrets, discovering lies and exposing the truth.

One would expect as much from a story centered on the sleuthing adventures of high school boys, but Chang takes the concepts even further to delve into the psyche of the teenage character. Layered with betrayal and deception, “Partners in Crime” takes viewers on a psychological ride to shed light on the minds of teens isolated by adults who are unable to understand their struggles.</p>\n<p>When introverted Huang Li-huai (Wu Chien-ho), studious Lin Yong-chuan (Deng Yu-kuai) and resident bad boy Yeh Yi-kai (Cheng Kai-yuan) stumble across the dead body of fellow student Hsia Wei-chiao (Yao Ai-ning), they are sent to the school’s guidance counselor.</p>\n<p>During sessions, the boys bond by discussing the past life and personality of a student they barely knew. They skim through video screenings and pointless, reflective writing assignments. But soon, something ticks inside them. Though they came in for closure, they walked out with quite the contrary: a mission to find the person responsible for Hsia’s so-called suicide. After all, the counselor did say, “If you run into anything unpleasant, you must learn to face it yourself.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Such parting words send a message to both the protagonists and the audience. While they emphasized that Huang, Lin and Yeh couldn’t rely on the police or adults to seek vengeance, the counselor’s words also served as a warning to viewers. Adolescent problems are more than “just a phase” and warrant as much advice and help as adults’. There are no shortcut cures. The counselor’s advice doubles as a promise that there is nothing she can do to help, leaving the boys no choice but to take matters into their own hands.</p>\n<p>The film starts out slow and straightforward: keeping the audience in the loop of the circumstances and the elements of the boys’ scheme (which isn’t much more harmful than a silly prank). But sure enough, viewers are thrown curveball after curveball as plans scatter into disarray and the teenagers are thrust into a rapid downward spiral. The helplessness of the adults in the film is then replicated within the audience: viewers are confused, unaware and even fear for the future of the teenagers, whose screams are unable to reach the adults surrounding them.</p>\n<p>“Partners in Crime” is a suspenseful thriller, not just because of its intricate plot but because it reveals the complex inner workings of the adolescent mind. As the film unveils the truth behind a girl’s death, it also exposes the perplexing thoughts of the teenage character, implying that most thoughts can go unnoticed on the big screen, as well as in reality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/partners-in-crime-sheds-light-on-the-truths-of-the-teenage-psyche/","id":5996,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5995,5994,5993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“McFarland, USA” Tells the American Story Picking and Running: Disney Film Explores Teenage Life in Central Valley","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kevin Costner plays Coach Jim White in Disney’s “McFarland, USA,” which tells the true story of a coach who inspired his seemingly hapless students to form a cross country team and go the distan...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60759\" style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"562308558\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60867\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60759\" data-attachment-id=\"60759\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/in-photos-30th-annual-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/sbiffinphotos6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=4148%2C2379&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4148,2379\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423338788\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFFinPhotos6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=888%2C509&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60759\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=460%2C265\" alt=\"The cast of  McFarland, USA.

(Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus)</i></p></div>\n<p>Kevin Costner plays Coach Jim White in Disney’s “McFarland, USA,” which tells the true story of a coach who inspired his seemingly hapless students to form a cross country team and go the distance. In interviews in a college conference call and on the Santa Barbara International Film Festival red carpet, Costner and White talked to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the film.</p>\n<p>Once known as the “Heartbeat of Agriculture,” McFarland, California is home to fields of cotton, almonds, sugar beets, oranges and grapes. Within this farming town’s predominantly Latino population, many students at the local high school in 1987 did not quite feel that it was home. Neither did their new gym teacher … until he saw how fast they could run.</p>\n<p>The last thing Coach White expected to run into in this little farmland was a group of speedy students. He sought kids who strived to succeed, so he had a tournament and offered the top four runners ice-cold Gatorade, a nicety during a hot Central Valley afternoon. Seeing how quickly they raced, he upped the stakes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I took the top guys in and bought them a milkshake,” White said in a college conference call with the <em>Nexus</em>. “I wanted a little more out of them so I said, ‘If all of you can run a mile in a certain time, I’ll take y’all out to dinner.’ This way, you’re building a team instead of just an individual because they have to encourage each other as a whole.” Upon finding further success, Coach White ran the idea of starting the high school’s first cross country team by the principal, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>To Costner, the sport aspect is merely the backdrop of the story. What made this inspirational was not so much the finish line but the authenticity. This little town in the Central Valley gave distinguished track teams a run for their money and won nine state championships. “It’s a combination of young men and a man with a level of wisdom and desire who come together with one goal in mind and achieve that through hard work,” Costner said.</p>\n<p>White established a cross country empire that dominates the sport to this day, as the pool of talented runners never seems to run dry. The 1987 team reached their stride with pure raw talent — without the gym, fancy equipment or even shoes. The seven runners ran against immense obstacles while working long hours in the fields to make ends meet. To overcome that and succeed shows that they were not run-of-the-mill high school students, a theme that manifests itself during Costner’s inspiring speech towards the end of the film.</p>\n<p>“Coaches have the power to build people up and we can equally tear someone down. So it’s a very delicate thing when you put the life of a young person [in] your hand,” said Costner. “Jim represents the difference an individual can make in a community like McFarland.”</p>\n<p>Besides being a true story, another special part about the film is that it stars three first-time actors from the town McFarland. “I think [Director] Niki Caro did a very interesting thing, casting actors from McFarland. That’s very brave. It also galvanized the community; it galvanized the boys that they were good enough to be there,” Costner said on the red carpet.</p>\n<p>Ramiro Rodriguez, who plays the film’s lovable chubby runner Danny Diaz, is from McFarland.</p>\n<p>“Seeing all the details [of the film] really brought joy to my heart. What you see onscreen is the real McFarland, [where] you see kids picking in the fields and going back to school,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the screening at SBIFF, Rodriguez waltzed down the red carpet, arms around his brothers from the movie, Michael Aguero and Rafael Martinez. All seven runners showed up to the Arlington, along with Costner and Caro. Within the boisterous group, Rodriguez and Aguero were the ones who couldn’t stop smiling.</p>\n<p>“Having us three — having all seven of us in one room, you’re going to have chemistry and chaos — nothing but jokes. We love each other like brothers, we fight each other like brothers,” Martinez said, to which the goofy-smiled Aguero interrupted. “We got competitive — we’d always push each other [onset].”</p>\n<p>Johnny Ortiz, who plays Jose Cardenas in the film, didn’t have the same playful attitude as the others at the red carpet, but gave thoughtful answers to reporters.</p>\n<p>“[The film] shows that Hispanics can play other roles … we can be doctors and lawyers … we don’t always have to be the gangbangers,” he said. At the end of the film, it was revealed that the real-life Cardenas went on to become a journalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is clear that “McFarland, USA” has meant a lot to the little community in the Central Valley. The movie has helped reshape how the city is represented in the long run.</p>\n<p>“Our old logo of the heartbeat of agriculture is obsolete. Now we have a silhouette of an athlete running and underneath it reads ‘Tradition, Community, and Excellence’,” White said.</p>\n<p>The 1987 McFarland High school cross country team was started by boys who wanted to run away from home and escape their dreary hamlet. Coach Jim White transformed it to redefine home as something to run for … and toward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60867\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/mcfarland-usa-tells-the-american-story-picking-and-running-disney-film-explores-teenage-life-in-central-valley/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60867\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/mcfarland-usa-tells-the-american-story-picking-and-running-disney-film-explores-teenage-life-in-central-valley/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/mcfarland-usa-tells-the-american-story-picking-and-running-disney-film-explores-teenage-life-in-central-valley/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/mcfarland-usa-tells-the-american-story-picking-and-running-disney-film-explores-teenage-life-in-central-valley/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/mcfarland-usa-tells-the-american-story-picking-and-running-disney-film-explores-teenage-life-in-central-valley/","id":6061,"author":{"id":756,"name":"Jane Huson"},"related":[6060,6059,6058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF Awards Steve Carell at Ceremony Looking Back on his Career","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Woo!

Famed for his comedic roles, Carell received the Outstanding Performance of the Year Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival for his portrayal of real-life millionaire and murderer John du Pont.</p>\n<p>A collage of videos set to Redbone’s “Come and Get Your Love” was shown to the audience, tracking Carell’s roles from “Bruce Almighty” to “Foxcatcher.” When asked if his wife of almost 20 years was uncomfortable with the clips showing him being intimate with other women, Carell responded, “No. She knows I have no chance with them.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The dialogue between Carell and Hammond started with a discussion about Carell’s performance in “Foxcatcher,” which earned him an Academy Award nomination. He described the uncertainty surrounding the film’s debut at Cannes: “We had no idea how the movie would resonate with people.”</p>\n<p>The conversation segued into a brief history of Carell’s initial path to success. After attending Denison University (where Carell was a DJ known as “Sapphire Steve Carell”), he worked with Stephen Colbert on “The Dana Carvey Show.” After that, Colbert managed to get him a job as a correspondent on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” by showing co-producer Madeleine Smithberg a skit he was in, “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.” He retained the position for six years before moving on to his acclaimed role as Michael Scott in “The Office.”</p>\n<p>Carell’s first major film role came in the form of television news reporter Evan Baxter in “Bruce Almighty.” In the film, the character is sent into a sputtering mess by Bruce (Jim Carrey), who has godlike powers. Modest man he is, Carell went to see the film with the mindset that his scenes had not made the final cut, when in actuality they did.</p>\n<p>The discussion then switched to “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” (“I lived that life,” said Hammond) specifically the famous chest-waxing scene. According to Carell, his reactions to the painful procedure were mostly authentic, and Romany Malco’s disgust was also quite real. The actress who had done the waxing reportedly had actual experience, but it turned out to be not enough. Before she waxed his nipple, the crew had to stop her as she had not applied any Vaseline. Had she continued, Carell might only have one nipple today.</p>\n<p>What was also very real (to frightening results) was the baboon in “Evan Almighty.” Carell attempted to improvise with the animal that had been trained to take a drink, and told it, “Don’t Bogart it!” The baboon hissed at him in response, and the trainer came over and told Carell, “Don’t look at the baboon. Don’t look it in the eyes.” Carell told the audience what he thought afterwards: “Don’t improvise with a baboon, idiot.”</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in contrast, nothing about “Little Miss Sunshine” was ever improvised. Carell found that experience particularly rewarding, as it gave him a chance to work with Alan Arkin. “I’m one of his biggest fans and supporters,” Carell said. “I really see him as a mentor. He’s an idol of mine.”</p>\n<p>He also took time to praise his other co-stars and friends. He complimented Carrey and Will Ferrell for both being talented, funny men, and Tina Fey for being a fantastic improviser. Some actors took longer to describe.</p>\n<p>“[Woody Allen] scared the shit out of me. I was so in fear of him. He’s a man of few words. I didn’t want to engage him,” Carell said. “I met him briefly in his office, I read the script [for “Melinda and Melinda.” He nodded and said, ‘Good.’”</p>\n<p>Carell revealed an interesting tidbit about Ryan Gosling, stating that one time the “Notebook” actor’s weekend plans to perform at a nursing home with his band. And amusingly enough, on Meryl Streep, Carell said that she’s, “The worst. In print, that won’t read ironically.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the ceremony, the Outstanding Performer of the Year trophy was given to Carell by his co-star of “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,” Jennifer Garner. After praising Carell as an actor and as her friend, she gave him the award and he in turn procured a No. 1 Presenter trophy for her. Ever the comedian, Carell ended his acceptance speech (and the night) with a call-and-response gag: “Thank you for coming,” he said before pointing at the audience, hoping that, as true <em>The Office </em>fans, they would understand.</p>\n<p>“That’s what she said!” came the reply.</p>\n<p><em>Like Steve Carell, Alex Wehrung loves lamp.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60858\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60858\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/sbiff-awards-steve-carell-at-ceremony-looking-back-on-his-career/","id":5977,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5976,5975,5974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Novelist Bruce Wagner Opens Film “Maps to the Stars” at SBIFF Spoiler Alert!

Though the trailer makes the film seem like a satire on Hollywood’s demented lifestyle, “Map to the Stars” centers on the twisted story about a family enduring the consequences of their life-long mistake: incest.</p>\n<p>The plot focuses on the return of a schizophrenic named Agatha Weiss (“Alice in Wonderland’s” Mia Wasikowska), the daughter of a powerful tinsel town family, to her home. The Weiss family members include patriarch Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Crusack), “momager” Christina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and child star son, Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird). Agatha’s hiatus from home was due to her stay at a sanatorium, where she went burning down her old house, almost killing her little brother. The incident was caused by Agatha’s early schizophrenia symptoms, which genetically formed from her parents’ incestuous relationship. Stafford and Christina were long-lost siblings who later reunited and fell in love.</p>\n<p>“The movie is about the perversion of the family and the original sin committed by the parents. They had a sexualized, incestuous relationship,” Wagner said in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Supported by copious amounts of medication, Agatha was able to find a job as forgotten actress Havana Segrand’s (Julianne Moore) assistant. Moore’s character had no inhibitions whatsoever. In a particular scene, she is caught sitting on toilet while enduring the pain of constipation. “That scene shows Julianne’s fearlessness. At a certain point, we were having some scheduling issues with her, and we were concerned that we had to go with a different actress, and the actress that we settled on refused, she could not do it,” Wagner shared.</p>\n<p>Chasing a far-fetched role to play her late mother in a film, Segrand was finally able to achieve the sought after role. Unfortunately, her assistant murders her after Segrand was discovered seducing Agatha’s boyfriend Jerome (Robert Pattinson).</p>\n<p>“[Julianne’s] character was fun for me to write because she’s completely uncensored, all of her fears and desperation, which is endemic in Hollywood for actors,” Wagner said. “She talks about her humiliation rather than trying to put on good face. Then later in the movie, when she gets that role she wanted, she becomes a little cooler. Ironically, that’s the moment of her downfall when the bad things happened to her. As a writer, it’s wonderful to write a character where there is no filter.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Agatha convinces her young brother to commit suicide with her so they can finally be free of the pain and suffering that they have endured all their lives. Together, lying on the unsettled land of their old, burned house, Agatha and Benjie swallow doses of pills and close their eyes under the stars. “It was a way for her to close the circle, which she does by suicide, so she couldn’t escape the perversion. But, she certainly escaped the sexualized element of it and she ended it heroically,” Wagner explained.</p>\n<p>Wagner wrote the film’s script 20 years prior to it being made, lending to a challenging process of waiting around. “It was a movie that was hopeless to begin with,” he said. “David [the director] became attached to it, so there was hope, and then that fell apart and another eight or nine years went by, so you would have to be insane to think that this movie would be made.”</p>\n<p>A novelist who focuses on extreme themes from wealth to poverty, fame to anonymity, Wagner has felt disparate responses to his work. “When <em>Dead Stars</em> [Wagner’s novel] came out, the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> full page on the weekend said it was a masterpiece. Two weeks later, the <em>New York Times</em> called it pornography,” Wagner said. “David’s works get similar divisiveness so we have had it all. But, no one is neutral about “Maps to the Stars”; people have either loved it or have a strong reaction against it. There’s no in-between whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>A man who touches on “the poles of the human experience,” Bruce Wagner hopes his new film “Maps to the Stars” will be remembered by his audience. “I hope that people will be entertained because it is an entertainment, and I hope people will be moved in many different ways. The movie stays with you regardless of your reactions, and I hope people laugh; there are funny moments too.”</p>\n<p><em>“Maps to the Stars” </em><em>will be released in select theaters and on VOD on Feb. 27. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/novelist-bruce-wagner-opens-film-maps-to-the-stars-at-sbiff-spoiler-alert-new-film-deals-with-incest-hollywood-and-murder/","id":5980,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[5979,5978,5977],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Emerson String Quartet Brings Classical Music to Campbell","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emerson-string-quartet-credit-richard-termine-new-york-times-redux-eyevine.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emerson-string-quartet-credit-richard-termine-new-york-times-redux-eyevine.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The crowd silenced as the four beaming, salt-and-pepper-haired string players strode across the stage toward their spotlight in matching black and white suits.

A classical piece for a quartet’s performance, this selection featured contrasts of loud and soft segments, which kept the audience engaged throughout. Unlike many selections of the time, this piece conveyed a sense of unity by achieving a musical conversation between the string players.</p>\n<p>Emerson String Quartet seemed to have conveyed that sense of unity well, as classical-music admirer Alice Lee applauded their synchronization abilities. “I was extremely impressed by their togetherness. That really defines a string quartet, you know, whether or not they speak to each other through their instruments,” Lee said in an interview after the show with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>The audience favorite of the night was Ravel’s String Quartet in F Major, a pleasant deviation from the norm of classical string quartet selections. The song allowed the first violinist, Philip Setzer, to share a warming melody with the audience. Then, the second violinist and violist played in synchrony as the piece led up to its climax.</p>\n<p>Pre-Biology major, music minor and bass player Ian Hay vouched for the audience’s opinion. “Ravel is a really interesting piece. It has a lot of emotion to it and lots of different dynamics and contrast. It just really appealed to me on an emotional level,” Hay said. Their performance for this selection earned a roaring standing ovation and murmurs of compliments throughout the crowd.</p>\n<p>Emerson String Quartet’s final selection was Beethoven’s Quartet in E-flat Major, Op. 127, a faster, finale-appropriate piece. Based off of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, this piece featured darker-sounding chords and a more dramatic harmony. The group accentuated the melodrama through their slight pops, sways and leans.</p>\n<p>Hay also mentioned the impressiveness of the group’s harmony. “I’ve seen lots of quartets and lots of orchestras. It seems that [Emerson String Quartet] has a lot of dynamic together,” Hay said. “You can tell that they’re communicating with each other through the course of the piece and they seem to be following each other really well. I think that’s a really nice thing to see because a lot of the time you’ll see [a quartet] almost sterile up there.”</p>\n<p>Following a few rounds of roaring applause and standing ovations, the quartet gifted an encore. Violinist Eugene Drucker informed the audience that the group had chosen Mozart’s unfinished “Fantasia,” composed on June 22, 1680. An audible gasp rippled through the crowd as Drucker introduced the piece’s origins.</p>\n<p>The four added personality to these classical pieces, appropriately flavoring a night of pure classical music; and, with a purposefully simplistic stage of black and white tones, the audience was able to better understand beauty not with the eyes but with the ears.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60718\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60718\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/the-emerson-string-quartet-brings-classical-music-to-campbell/","id":7007,"author":{"id":750,"name":"Sophie Ho"},"related":[7006,7005,7004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LOUDPVCK turns Earl Warren into a Trap House for One Night","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mobile-747a0021eb349e9c.jpg?resize=320%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mobile-747a0021eb349e9c.jpg?resize=320%2C494&ssl=1","description":"A hooded woman clad from head to toe in jet black “ǂ₩0ИK” gear stood in stark contrast against the perspiring orange walls of the bathroom hallway.

Her bandana bounced onto the oversized hoodie with each hum of bass. A person in a T-Rex costume nearly shoulder-checked a shirtless python-armed man, skipping his way back to the dance floor. On Saturday, Jan. 31, this smorgasbord of unlikely companions gathered at Earl Warren Showgrounds for one reason — the all-star DJ cast of Zimmer, AC Slater, Djemba Djemba and, of course, LOUDPVCK.</p>\n<p>Zimmer’s set was a good introduction to Saturday’s theme: Play a little something for everyone. Down-tempo grungy was the icebreaker as the French DJ began the long and grueling process of warming a crowd of standers.</p>\n<p>As people trickled in one-by-one, the groove deviated from its original trajectory. Low bass hums gradually sharpened into intermittent synth stabs. Swaying began in the crowd, and cross-armed fraternity brothers tapped their feet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Zimmer’s tropical remix of “Don’t Wanna Dance” echoed throughout the dome, as hip shakes possessed the small crowd of a few hundred.</p>\n<p>Felix Dechant, longtime Zimmer fan, concluded that Zimmer’s set was a very traditional deep European set that didn’t really fit into the theme of the of the entire show. However, he went on to say that the set was very artfully crafted and performed its job of loosening the crowd.</p>\n<p>Next on the menu was AC Slater. The Dim Mak DJ’s set was the closest thing to a club mix that evening and transformed the crowd entirely. Audience members were jumping and fist pumping to the guttural tribal sounds of Slater. “Woo’s” and chants could be heard over each layer of white noise.</p>\n<p>While the crowd was visibly more energetic, Slater’s performance was largely unchanging with the occasional sprinkling of crowd-pleasing tracks like CoCo.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Swanson, or Djemba Djemba as his diehard fans know him, spun the most versatile tracks of the evening. Swanson mixed everything from future bass to traditional trap to deep house to straight hip hop. Unfortunately, the track selection was slightly lower energy than the hard-to-please crowd needed. While there was a certain degree of moshing for hits such as “NRG” and RL Grime’s “Core,” in general the crowd was largely stationary, probably in anticipation of more big room house music.</p>\n<p>Katelyn Carano, a hoop dancer hired for the event, offered an explanation for the lackluster prestige of electronic music performances in Santa Barbara. Carano implied that there is a much smaller scene of electronic music fans in SB than in other metropolitan cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles. As a result, Santa Barbara shows are usually comprised of partiers who have never heard of the acts, avid festival goers, traditional Kandi-wearing ravers and spiritual types that run the local transformative festival, Lucidity. As a result, DJs experience issues tailoring their sets to such a diverse audience.</p>\n<p>However, nobody overcame this obstacle better than LOUDPVCK. The “Kill Bill” fight theme song blared through speakers as the silhouettes of Kenny Beats and Ryan Marks became visible behind the DJ stand.</p>\n<p>After ten minutes of the loudest festival trap of the evening, Marks grabbed the mic and shouted, “That was the warm-up round!” The crowd danced with ferocity as PVCK dropped one festival standard after another.</p>\n<p>To charge up the visibly tiring crowd, Marks put his lips to the microphone once again. “Who’s a ’90s baby out there?” he shouted. Dancers erupted as “California Love” bumped over the speakers followed by “Still D.R.E.” and “Big Poppa.”</p>\n<p>“I graduated from Santa Barbara High School,” Marks said into the mic, a few minutes before the end of the show. The statement mustered the last ounce of energy remaining in the depleted showgrounds.</p>\n<p>Ending with their latest Dada Life remix, LOUDPVCK said their thanks to a roaring crowd. While they did not spin the most innovative set, they knew their demographic and appropriately calibrated their gears. PVCK put on a good set but an even better show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/","id":7006,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7005,7004,7003],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"RL Grime Creates Turbulence at Sold-Out Velvet Jones Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=479%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Squeezing my way into a crowd of sweaty college students and post-adolescents, I was captivated by the tall silhouette that appeared on the stage of the completely sold-out Velvet Jones.

With people staggered from wall to wall without an inch of space left, all eyes were fixated on the figure that stood before us. A flickering hue of purple shined onstage, outlining a crooked snapback and slim physique. With the music slowly rising in volume and the audience bustling with an intense roar of excitement, the artist grabbed the mic and declared “I go by the name of RL Grime. Santa Barbara let me see those hands!” The bass dropped.</p>\n<p>24-year-old Henry Steinway, otherwise known by his stage name, RL Grime, is a popular electronic artist and producer from Los Angeles, CA. Famous for his addictive mixture of both electronic dance music and hip hop-sampled trap, RL Grime is a favored artist in the EDM-infatuated culture of our generation. So it’s no surprise that the entirety of his nationwide Void Tour, which kicked off in October, has been a major success. Santa Barbara welcomed him with open arms this past Thursday, Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>RL Grime is part of WeDidIt Collective, which includes artists such as Shlohmo and Ryan Hemsworth. His entrancing original tunes and stimulating remixes have gotten millions of plays on SoundCloud. The list includes originals such as “Tell Me” and “Core” and remixes of Big Sean’s “Kingpin” and Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa.” His 2008 EP <em>High Beams</em> debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic chart and at No. 8 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. <em>Void</em>, his 2014 debut studio album, is just another step towards the artist’s growing world of electronic possibilities. It seems that no matter how the L.A. native chooses to demonstrate his musical talents, his devoted fan base continues to expand.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Presented by REDEYE and EPIC events, Velvet Jones became the destination for hundreds of EDM lovers. Tommy Kruise and Lunice warmed up the venue with their refreshing hip hop remixes, pumping up everyone for the sold-out night. When RL Grime finally hit the stage, college students who were otherwise stressed with papers and midterms filled with nothing but happiness and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>The young artist remained stationed behind his elevated podium, giving off a mysterious vibe throughout the set. The lighting primarily came from behind, casting a dark shadow over him to set off the vibrant shades of red, green and purple. In rare moments, a light shined directly onto RL Grime, exposing his zealous expression and intriguing appearance. In front of his wide podium was the shape of a gravestone — the iconic symbol of the WeDidIt collective.</p>\n<p>“Scylla,” a <em>Void </em>favorite, opened the set. Instead of easing the crowd into some of his more regularly rhythm beats, RL Grime jumped right into the good stuff — the type of “good stuff” that everyone came to see him for. “Scylla” was perfect for this, stunning the audience with enrapturing beats and base drops that cast a rebellious spell over everyone. Its lower-toned attributes and fast-paced theme created a turbulent atmosphere which translated into a vicious monster-fighting scene in a film. Velvet Jones exploded with pandemonium.</p>\n<p>RL Grime continued to bless the crowd with mind-blowing bass drops, hip hop snippets and trap vibrations. Songs such as “Core” and “Heard Me” set the venue on fire. People began crowd-surfing and standing on the ledges along the edges of Velvet Jones, and the intensity of the bass shaking the walls increased everyone’s fervor. Remixes of Beyonce’s “711,” YG’s “My Ni**a,” Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” and TNGHT’s “Acrylics” created extreme devoutness to the music. RL Grime truly has a way of making an audience feel invincible.</p>\n<p>With a set that lasted over an hour and a half, RL Grime did not let his devotees down for a single second. Towards the end, he came out from behind his podium and made his way to the front of the stage, announcing that he had one more song in store before the end of the night. As he made his way back behind the podium, the beginning of “Tell Me” started playing and everyone knew that the best part of the night was about to happen. As the music built up and the bass was about to drop, RL Grime counted down from three and Velvet Jones erupted one last time. He added in an interesting remix of the tune before once again playing the beloved and well-known drop for which the L.A. native is known. As I headed home, the strong melody still rang in my ears.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60640\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60640\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/","id":7005,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7004,7003,7002],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cousteau Family Honored with the Attenborough Award  “Secret Ocean 3D” Grants Cousteau Excellence in Nature Filmmaking Award","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JeanMIchelCosteauSecret-Ocean-3D.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JeanMIchelCosteauSecret-Ocean-3D.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The second day of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival found the Arlington Theatre packed with many eager to meet the legendary Cousteau family.

While most documentaries cast the big fish (whales, sharks, dolphins and the like) as their stars, “Secret Ocean 3D” gives the smaller organisms their chance to shine on the big screen.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Dr. Sylvia Earle, “Secret Ocean 3D” brings the audience up close and personal with some of the world’s most eerie and amazing creatures. Viewers, however, couldn’t appreciate these breathtaking scenes if it weren’t for the new filming tools utilized specifically for this documentary. Now, underwater shots can be made in 3D, Ultra-HD 4K, close up, macro and with motion control. “Secret Ocean 3D” takes full advantage of this technology and it certainly shows through the vibrant colors of the giant clam’s flesh, the smooth movements of the octopus, and the vivid colors of Christmas tree worms dotting the coral reefs.</p>\n<p>Cousteau’s mission, however, is not just to inform. In uncovering the wonders of the ocean, he also hopes to show why humans must be proactive in protecting the ocean. Take plankton, for example. It’s a crucial source of food to many marine animals and produces more than half the Oxygen on Earth. So almost every breath humans take is “a gift from the ocean.” By showing the enormous impact of such tiny organisms, Cousteau demonstrates not just the important role plankton plays in the ocean food chain but also why humans need the ocean as much as the ocean needs them.</p>\n<p>The screening was followed by a panel discussion with the Cousteau family moderated by Tim Matheson. Jean-Michel spoke fondly of his relationship with his father who strapped an Aqua-lung on his back at the age of seven and pushed him overboard into the water. That event soon spurred into family scuba diving in the Mediterranean sea, many adventures on board the ship, <em>Calypso</em>, and of course Jean-Michel’s legacy in ocean exploration. Even after creating countless films and publishing a best-selling autobiography about his father, <em>My Father, My Captain, </em>there’s one thing that continues to keep Jean-Michel excited about his commitment to saving the oceans.</p>\n<p>“Every time I have the opportunity to look in the eyes of a child, I always say ‘I will never let you down because I want you to have the same privilege as I’ve had. And thus we need to do everything we can to protect our life support system and that’s the message I’ve been trying to pass on. Fortunately it has impacted those two there,” said Jean-Michel, gesturing to Celine and Fabien.</p>\n<p>Celine has a different approach in ocean conservation and spoke about her work regarding the indigenous tribes of the Vale do Javari reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, illegal activities and oil exploitation have negatively impacted the tribes and help contribute to their enormous health crisis. But through multi-media content such as film and photography, she hopes to be able to bring awareness to such people and educate others on their changes they can make to better conserve the environment.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s very important to put the human being at the center of every story. That’s how you connect to a wider audience and have them understand their connection to any place, ecosystem, or issue.”</p>\n<p>Fabien, for his part, strives to showcase ocean exploration as an adventure through a project called Mission 31. For 31 days, Fabien and his team lived in an underwater habitat, exploring the ocean at 63 feet below the surface as well as connecting such discoveries with the world.</p>\n<p>“For the first time ever we invited the world to live at the bottom of the sea. We did Skype with classrooms and Google hangouts and were able to share a lot of the discoveries that were happening in real time. It was really important to tell the story in a more immersive way, pun intended, in a way that can have young generations dream.”</p>\n<p>The work of the Cousteau family has expanded over three generations and though Jean-Michel, Celine and Fabien have accomplished much in their lives, there is still work to be done. Pollutants, climate change and overconsumption have negatively impacted our environment but there is still hope. And the first step in making a change is education and awareness.</p>\n<p>“This is our life support system and why we exist,” Jean-Michel said. “If we protect the ocean, we protect ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/","id":5975,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5974,5973,5972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“The Truth About Lies” Delves into Self-Identity","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On one level, “The Truth About Lies” is largely an account of writer and director Phil Allocco’s own life’s misfortunes.

On a deeper level, it delves into the human issue of self-identity. The title itself was enough to pique the interest of enough people to fill the Metro 4 Theater in downtown Santa Barbara. This doesn’t come as a surprise. After all, everyone can be guilty of the inescapable character flaw of lying, even those who don’t consider themselves a “liar.”</p>\n<p>The bright independent comedy follows main character Gilby Smalls, who loses his job, his apartment and his girlfriend all in the same day. To cope, he begins lying his way out of the disheartening situation, and the fabrications ultimately catch up with him.</p>\n<p>In a discussion regarding the nature of lies, I asked Allocco how he came up with the film’s premise. Allocco finds the commonality of the nature of people’s lies interesting. He believes that, rather than being hurtful or malicious, most people lie to make themselves seem more impressive, both to themselves and to others. Thus, he began penning the screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“My only prerequisite was that every character had to either be lying to each other or themselves,” Alloco said.</p>\n<p>After watching the film, I realized that each character really was living their own lie. While Gilby completely fakes his way to landing jobs and women, the secondary characters also lie to distract themselves from a painful reality.</p>\n<p>Allocco implied that lying to oneself can be a crucial step towards self-discovery, a path that the characters struggle with. Even the seemingly happy characters end up facing their own lies. Gilby supports this point when he asserts in the film that “knowing yourself is a luxury.” This begs the question: How many of us really know ourselves?</p>\n<p>The pervasiveness of lying is shown throughout the film with the help of black-and-white onscreen quotes dividing each scene. Each quote derives from noteworthy figures such as Mark Twain or Oscar Wilde, and they pick away at the nature of lying.</p>\n<p>The film takes place in a hip metropolis somewhere in New York and features a certain brand of humor typically found in daytime sitcoms. The plot explodes when everybody who has been lied to by Gilby joins together at an ill-fated dinner party and each character is left to confront the truth.</p>\n<p><em>“The Truth About Lies” will be released in select theaters this month.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The audience was deeply captivated by what they were seeing. “Confession” is a powerful debut film from South Korean writer and director Do-yun Lee, aided by talented cinematographer Eok Yu. A smart, tense thriller, the movie’s dose of dark humor makes it into a great genre film.</p>\n<p>The film, whose original Korean title literally translates to “Good Friends,” begins by showing the three protagonists, Min-soo, In-chul and Hyun-tae, skipping out on their middle-school graduation to screw around on a mountaintop. When Min-soo falls and gets injured, his friends carry him to safety down the mountain as it begins to snow.</p>\n<p>This scene quickly sets up their personalities: Min-soo is easily manipulated, In-chul is an aggressive, action-taking kind of guy and Hyun-tae is the level-headed one. From the way these three act towards each other, their friendship feels believable.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skip to years later, Hyun-tae is a paramedic married to an ostracized deaf woman, while Min-soo and In-chul lead unsatisfying lives. When Hyun-tae’s mother comes up with a scheme to burn down her illegal casino to get the insurance money, In-chul and Min-soo quickly join in. And everything that can go wrong … well, you already read the top of the article.</p>\n<p>What this reporter admires most about “Confession” is its restraint. The film’s intensity doesn’t require excessive violence or gunfights. While there is some violence, it’s overshadowed by the smart dialogue and character interactions. And there are a lot of interesting personalities that bring flavor: the cool, yet slimy loan shark, wild and angry In-chul, Hyun-tae’s rude mother, emotional Min-soo and, of course, the rational, yet determined Hyun-tae. All these characters are written beautifully and fit well within the movie’s twisted plot.</p>\n<p>If I were to have any complaints, it might be the fact that the subtitles still need another proofread, and the film takes a little too long to end.

Film School graduate Vishal Solanki. Originally conceived as a simple effort, the film’s blueprint spanned only four cities within the United States. However, the project expanded to include people from all around the world, from coffee growers in South America and Africa to European and American caffeine addicts.</p>\n<p>The film takes focus on several subjects, but at the forefront are two groups: entrepreneurs who wish to profit off of coffee by starting their own businesses, and farmers who have difficulty making a decent profit off of their crop.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A fun and introspective look into coffee culture, the documentary relies heavily on interviews. Farmers and businessmen alike showed how coffee affects the lives of people, both socially and economically. An interesting choice by the directors was to not give the film any overlying narration, relying on the interviews to convey which direction the documentary was going to next.</p>\n<p>However, the cuts between interviews did not transition seamlessly, and the sound editing was a bit rough. In a few scenes, white noise pervaded in the background and voiceovers from interviewees seemed to drop out into oblivion upon transitioning to a new location.</p>\n<p>Even so, the interviews were funny and insightful. Coffeemakers showed numerous techniques for creating special blends and making sure their beans are up to high standards, and coffee servers shared their dreams of starting their own businesses.</p>\n<p>Taking on a more serious edge, “Caffeinated” also puts heavy focus on the plights of farmers. Whether it’s politics, weather or decreased demand, coffee farmers often find themselves struggling to sell. The farmers are struggling, and their children don’t want to take over the farms.  So, what will happen? This exposé kept the documentary in an educational realm.</p>\n<p>“Caffeinated” is an entertaining documentary from Solanki and Nguyen, alternating from lighthearted to serious. Coffee enthusiasts/addicts will be severely interested.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung has, ironically, never drank coffee in his life.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/documentary-caffeinated-is-stimulating-fresh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/documentary-caffeinated-is-stimulating-fresh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/documentary-caffeinated-is-stimulating-fresh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/documentary-caffeinated-is-stimulating-fresh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/documentary-caffeinated-is-stimulating-fresh/","id":5976,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5975,5974,5973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“It Starts With the Script” Writer’s Panel  SBIFF Panel Uncovers the Process and Art Behind Screenwriting","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.15.46-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.15.46-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Like most Hollywood professions, the art and business of screenwriting is perplexing.

Career paths don’t necessarily follow the same direction (although the formulaic nature of scripts themselves are debatable). “It Starts With the Script,” a writer’s panel presented by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival hoped to shed some light onto the craft of scriptwriting and the process of using pen, paper and keyboard to project stories onto the big screen.</p>\n<p>Many screenwriters often begin work in different fields (journalism, novel penning, etc.), but quite a few have set their eyes on the movie industry from the get-go. Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) always knew he wanted a career in film and moved to L.A. from New Jersey. The first few years in the business found him writing for hire, doing scripts for low-budget horror and sci-fi movies until he finally found the opportunity to direct his own script.</p>\n<p>“I was hoping to get my foot in the door,” Chazelle said, “and ‘Whiplash’ was my first thing that actually convinced people to let me in. But I think that’s only because I spent a few years in the trenches writing commercial stuff before I convinced people that a jazz movie is actually viable.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jazz was to Chazelle as journalism was to Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). After graduating college, Gilroy started writing in New York as a reporter and reviewer before deciding that writing screenplays (and working at home in his pajamas) was the way to go. But he never let go of his inner news junkie and sure enough, the control rooms of television drew him back and gave him the opportunity to fuse both passions within “Nightcrawler.” As an original screenplay, “Nightcrawler” gave Gilroy full reign to employ his creativity.</p>\n<p>“Like most of us, I do a studio job and I felt increasingly constrained by the small box that you’re allowed to move in,” Gilroy said. “Everything has to be explained, characters needed to be redeemed, and so on. I was in an ornery mood so I wrote a script for myself in which I’d decided to break every narrative rule. But it just turned out that breaking all these conventions connected with the [Nightcrawler] world.”</p>\n<p>Most scripts, however, don’t click as easily. Jason Hall (“American Sniper”) had “this tremendous responsibility and this great burden” to depict the heavy toll of war on the human psyche. Hall traveled to Texas in 2010 to meet Chris Kyle, the film’s real-life protagonist, who had left the military for about nine months. From the look in Kyle’s eyes to the way he fell on his knees to embrace his children, Hall immediately knew that this man had endured and suffered.</p>\n<p>“It’s unnatural for humans to take a life,” explained Hall. “And so, in creating this movie, we sort of did things so that it becomes easier for them to create this character that could take a life. This is a movie about a soldier. This is a story about all soldiers in a way, exploring the archetype of the warrior and what the cost is to the soldier and what the cost is to his family.”</p>\n<p>Hall wasn’t the only writer to adapt a screenplay from someone’s life story. Ever since he finished the ending of Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time, </em>Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”) was hooked. Writing a script about Hawking, however, wasn’t easy. McCarten didn’t want to make a movie using only publicly known facts, but Hawking didn’t allow investigation into his personal life. After reading Jane Hawking’s writing on her relationship with Stephen, McCarten took the initiative to ride a train to Cambridge and immediately declared his ambition to make a movie about her life. Brushing aside Jane’s immediate look of horror, McCarten hoped that if he was charming enough, he could have the signature for the book rights that afternoon. He waited for eight years.</p>\n<p>“The interesting point of the film was that it was about the caregiver as much as it was about the cared,” McCarten said. “They had to break their own theories about what relationships are. They’re two very conservative people, but their situation provides them to be very heroic.”</p>\n<p>For writers like Hall and McCarten, interest in someone’s life story sparked a desire to share it on the big screen. For those like Chazelle, past ambitions helped develop a screenplay with heart. For Graham Moore (“The Imitation Game”), it was both. As a teenager, Moore had a passion for computer science and was a huge Alan Turing fan. In adapting the screenplay, he put Turing’s mathematical genius at the forefront of his character, while simultaneously sparking a debate regarding the portrayal of homosexuals onscreen.</p>\n<p>“He’s a mathematician who happens to be gay, not a gay mathematician,” Moore said. “The movie was never meant to be the last word on Alan Turing; it was meant to be the first word where we wanted people to know his name. His name should be known as well as Newton’s and Darwin’s. But it’s not, because he’s gay and he’s persecuted for it.”</p>\n<p>Seeing as each panelist held a unique vision, it naturally follows that different writing strategies worked for different writers. Alex Dinelaris (“Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance”) likes to spend eight–nine months structuring a screenplay “to every inch of its life.” But often, he allows his subconscious to take over and handle the inspirational side of things.</p>\n<p>“I have two babies and when I’m changing the diaper or cooking, that’s when the subconscious starts to work,” Dinelaris explained. “An idea will hit me and when they start to pile up to the point where I think they might suffocate me, I’d fly to that little place in Puerto Rico. Cell phone doesn’t work, internet doesn’t work but eight–nine days later, I’d come back with a draft.”</p>\n<p>Max Frye (“Foxcatcher”) likes to take an old-fashioned route via yellow legal pad and felt pen. But when he takes it to the computer, the transcript is, in essence, already a rewrite. The blend of old and modern writing tools seems effective, though Frye admitted that procrastination was still an issue.</p>\n<p>“I’d get to the point where I’d keep putting it off,” Frye said, “and then it’ll be 6 o’ clock and I’d go ‘Oh, well, it’s coffee time.’ But I completely changed my life by writing first thing in the morning without doing anything else. If I even go to the bank, I’m ruined for the day.”</p>\n<p>Several panelists described similar experiences from hunting for inspiration to forcing oneself to work (Gilroy reported using stone as his writing tablet). While these were some of several recurring themes in the writers’ work, it’s clear that none of their careers started on the same course. Whether it’s utilizing the experiences from a past profession or revisiting a childhood passion, SBIFF’s writer’s panel showed that a story doesn’t necessarily start with the script as much as it starts with the heart.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/","id":6063,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6062,6061,6060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jennifer Aniston Sells Out the Arlington to Fans  “Cake” Star Receives Montecito Award","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The street facing the Arlington Theatre in Downtown Santa Barbara was completely blocked off to cars while staff anxiously scurried to make sure everything was in place.

A mass of reporters and photographers began to pool behind a low iron gate. On the opposite end, frenzied crowds gathered. Between them, a lifeless red carpet connected the street to the theater doors. The reason for the chaos on Friday, Jan. 30 was written in lights on the marquee: Jennifer Aniston, the recipient of this year’s Montecito Award, given by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF).</p>\n<p>The awaited actress finally pulled up in a black SUV at around 7:40 p.m. She was immediately met with the fans’ screams and a surge of white papers shoved over the iron barrier. Upon arrival, Aniston’s fiancé, Justin Theroux, swiftly made his way across the carpet and silently retreated in the theater, leaving unnoticed. This was his way of being careful not to detract from his fiancée’s night. Being the seasoned and diplomatic Hollywood actress that she is, Aniston was sure to attend to the fans first. After quelling their screams, she began making her way down the press line, pausing periodically for questions and pictures, as over-exuberant fans belted the “Friends” theme song in an attempt to win back her attention.</p>\n<p>The primary reason for the 45-year old actress’s presence at SBIFF was her recent performance in Daniel Barnz’s dark independent drama, “Cake.” With its issues of chronic pain and addiction, “Cake” doesn’t quite fit the actress’s repertoire of lighter romantic comedies, or even her more emotional films such as “Marley &amp; Me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I asked the New York native what her least favorite part of filming the atypical role of Claire was, to which she carefully responded, “Stopping it!

Everyone was sort of getting out of their real selves and taking a risk, and everyone was really supportive each of each other and it was…” her voice trailed off, before she dreamily sighed, “I was in heaven, so I was sad when it was over.”</p>\n<p>The actress of over 25 years was not nominated for the exclusive Montecito Award, but rather chosen. Although the foremost reason for this award is her role in “Cake<em>,</em>” it dually honors the countless other performances that have paved her successful career.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8 o’clock the hoard of ticketholders for the night’s event flooded the theatre, as Aniston sat down for an extensive interview accompanied by various clips of her past performances. The talk completely sold out the Arlington’s 2,000 seats, a rare feat. Her entire acting career was spanned, beginning with her years spent at a “Fame”-style performing arts high school in New York. After years of determination, double shifts and failed pilots (“Ferris Bueller” TV series anyone?), a fateful summer in L.A. finally led Aniston to her role as Rachel on the iconic “Friends.” A star was born.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston quickly became a major household name in the 90s and has continued as one into present times. Even then, she makes it a point to mention that it’s still hard for her at times to land specific roles she wants. This is partly due to the baggage that comes with being a world-famous actress conflicting with the desired obscurity of smaller films. There’s also the tragic tendency for artists to be pigeonholed into one role. Still, she enjoys the challenge of consistently proving herself, stating she “had to lobby” for the chance to play Claire in “Cake.”</p>\n<p>Watching the numerous filmstrips from the theatre’s balcony, it is hard to deny the often-overlooked variety of Aniston’s roles and the specific talent delivered in each one.
