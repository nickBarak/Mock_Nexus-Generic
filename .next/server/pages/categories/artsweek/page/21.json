Last Friday night, the L.A.-based upstarts known as The Regrettes rocked Santa Barbara with openers nucklehead and Pancho and The Wizards.<br>\nVelvet Jones holds a unique position among Santa Barbara’s great music venues. Everything about the place elevates it from a simple concert venue to a communal space for like-minded people to mosh and go insane together. There’re the rebellious red walls and lighting. There’s the black-and-white mural of a guitarist flipping off the crowd. There’s the “rock-on” gesture in the Velvet Jones logo behind the stage. It all adds up to form a very welcoming space that feels specialized in the type of community it aims to serve. When talking to fellow concertgoers, a few claimed Velvet Jones as their favorite venue. It’s intimate, but not cramped. It’s punk, but still inviting.</p>\n<p>The night began with Pancho and The Wizards, who perfectly embodied the new California beach punk skater aesthetic. The San Luis Obispo band led by their overalls-wearing frontman Tristan Cole Wildey, or Pancho, showed a lot of potential. Pancho’s vocals perfectly cut through the more noisy backing instrumentation and deliver some funny and tightly written lyrics. The band also did a great job bringing the energy throughout the set with the group’s bassist jamming out in the crowd for a portion of one of the songs. It’s easy to envision Pancho and The Wizards moving up in the punk scene here in California.</p>\n<p>Following Pancho and The Wizards was the Ventura-based punk band nucklehead. This group similarly drew inspiration from the California beach skater punk scene, but went about it a different way. While Pancho’s vocals were clear and crisp and separated themselves from the mix, nucklehead’s vocals were the opposite and utilized heavy mic reverb to create a sound that reminded me of some of the harder Descendants cuts.  As their set was wrapping up, a few audience members yelled out for one of the band’s most popular cuts, “Burrito,” which is about rushing to the toilet after a bad burrito. The crowd went nuts and the beginnings of a mosh pit that would soon envelop Velvet Jones began to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you find yourself at a show at Velvet Jones on a Friday night, you might find yourself intensely hungry like I was last week. Luckily, at Velvet Jones there’s Mac N Cheese After Dark. I ordered without ever having to leave the building, but you can also order out front, where many drunk clubgoers were taking full advantage of the dish. Then, finally, the main event was here: The Regrettes.</p>\n<p>The audience packed toward the stage as the band came out. While it took a while to get going, by the third song the crowd was going nuts. Bright pastel-colored balloons were knocked about by the jumping mass of people as the moshing got more intense. The energy that filled the room felt so contagious that I rushed into the pit knowing my glasses could be destroyed with one rogue elbow — but I didn’t care. During one of the band’s best songs, “Picture Perfect,” lead singer Lydia Night came into the audience and sang the catchy-as-hell refrain with the crowd as we were all dancing. I guarantee it was the coolest thing that happened in Santa Barbara that night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77376\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"725156750\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77376\" data-attachment-id=\"77376\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/the-regrettes-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"the regrettes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77376\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Regrettes</p></div>\n<p>As I started getting tired, I moved to the back of the pit to get some air and saw a sound tech a mere 10 to 15 feet away from the pit precariously balancing two iPads filled with green and yellow sound monitors on one arm. I do not understand what he was thinking, but luckily for him, the pit stayed relatively contained, and by the time the infamous wall of death began a few songs later, he was gone. While you might be thinking something called the wall of death seems idiotic and reckless, which I assure you it is, it’s something I had to experience at least once. That’s the thing that makes moshing fun in the first place. I soon saw how crazy it could be when a fully-grown man got knocked to the ground beside my feet, but I soon helped him to his feet and he was back moshing. That’s what makes Velvet Jones special. You feel the community atmosphere and when a band as charismatic as The Regrettes performs, the audience will have an amazing time. I asked bassist Sage Nicole after the show how the band is able to transfer their energy to the audience so well and she said, “It’s something that came naturally, really. Once we got more used to performing, we’ve tried to play it up.”</p>\n<p>You might think from my description of the show that The Regrettes is a band of veteran rockers, but you would be wrong. None of them are even seniors in high school. That is what is perhaps most exciting about The Regrettes. They aren’t just a high school rock band, they are a fully fledged, intensely energetic band with hard-hitting punk songs and a nostalgic pop-appeal that also happen to be teenagers. As I travelled back home covered in sweat not entirely my own, I knew that all of us in that mosh pit that night had experienced something special.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6809,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6808,6807,6806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Coachella 2017: In Review","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No matter how big you look in that photo, at Coachella you’re a drop in a wave. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coachella just keeps getting bigger. This year, not only were the grounds literally pushed outward on the far end, giving the Outdoor Theatre and Gobi and Mojave tents more room (and less bleed of audiences and sound from Sahara and the main stage), but over 20,000 more festival goers were admitted for each weekend. Also, two new, desert-themed tents were added (or a net of one tent, if you subtract James Murphy’s Despacio experience from last year): the punk and DIY-focused Sonora and the breathtaking digital art project, the Antarctic. As the music festival of music festivals grows up and out, with more feet stomping grass and more eyes looking in, it stakes more of a claim in California youth culture. So, Artsweek visited the fest this past weekend to take it all in and break it all down.</p>\n<p>Our generation’s rockstar, Mac DeMarco, won the Outdoor crowd over Friday afternoon with his trademark gap-toothed charm. Vibing effortlessly with his bandmates and friends, Joe, Jon and Andy, Mac’s playfulness was as infectious as ever. Lampooning both the culture of high-profile guest appearances at the fest and the culture of popular mediocrity, the band welcomed “Ed Sheeran” to the stage in the form of redheaded friend and former bassist Pierce McGarry, who displayed an affected British accent. Mac has earned this little jab; even as he continues to accrue more and more followers and influence, he’s continued to develop his talents. As he belted out the first “Oh baby” of one of his best and most rarely performed songs, “My Kind of Woman,” he displayed an almost stunning vocal acuity that stood out from his usual low talk-singing of shows past. His emphatic performance filled out the range of the song, and his increased singing chops paired with the comfortable tightness of his band made this an act not to miss over these weekends. UCSB class of 2016 alumnus Dar Sadeghi counted himself a fan after the set, saying that he thought it was “the best I’ve seen this weekend.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77384\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1133129271\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77384\" data-attachment-id=\"77384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/img-665384-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=1803%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1803,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Img-665384\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77384\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?w=1803&amp;ssl=1 1803w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Thank you, bass god. Thundercat started late in the Mojave on Saturday, probably just because he was busy anointing his magic fingers for the show. When he took the stage, TCat was rocking his irreverent style with a gothic, cartoon-villain gargoyle headdress complete with horns, wings, gilded demon-skull shoulder pads and what looked like rondels made of shrunken nun heads. Despite the get-up, the virtuoso’s skills spoke for themselves as he slapped and plucked his six-string’s way through jams like “Heartbreaks + Setbacks” and “Them Changes.” Musician-comedian Reggie Watts joined Thundercat and his pair of bandmates (a pianist/synth player and a drummer) for a few vocal riffs, but his mic was off through the first chunk of his performance. Some more sound issues affected the set, such as the low ends of the bass being too high and drowning some other sounds out, but the remarkable skill and gusto on display compensated. Thundercat wound down with a medley of songs he helped produce for other artists, leading Flying Lotus’s “MmmHmm” into Kendrick Lamar’s “Complexion” and back again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the most impressive acts to inaugurate the new Sonora tent was a punk act out of Rhode Island called Downtown Boys. Their performance burst with radically political energy, with lead singer Victoria Ruiz calling for the redistribution of power and wealth and the end of white supremacy in between her bouts of wild shaking, bouncing and bilingual chanting of songs like “(Brown and Smart)” and their sax-heavy Springsteen cover “Dancing In The Dark.” As their Saturday set of weekend two coincided with Earth Day and the March for Science across the nation, the band led a small march of their own “toward the phallic-looking sculptures and back.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Yuma tent hosted a superset with pro DJs Floating Points, Daphni (aka Caribou) and Four Tet. The three spent time mixing and trading off at the helm, experimenting with each other’s beats and basslines to make new permutations of house for the lab mice in the crowd to boogie down to. All three are modern powerhouses of the genre in their own right, so their collaboration proved a pleasure to shake it to.</p>\n<p>Like the man of the hour, Kendrick, would later on Sunday night, DC rapper GoldLink tore down the lamely common discussion of whether live rappers can put on a good show. GoldLink hosted a party in the Mojave, starting with a few songs of his own in front of flashing traffic light props before MCing a breakdown of age-old hits to bring up the hype level, including hitting a mean air guitar riff to “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Link wasted no time getting right back to “the regularly scheduled programming,” performing “Late Night” with Masego and “Some Girl” with Steve Lacy, who went on to perform his own song “Ryd.” It was a good weekend for Lacy, the guitarist of The Internet, who would later be given a shoutout by Kendrick himself after his performance of “Pride,” which Lacy co-produced.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77385\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"793888451\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77385\" data-attachment-id=\"77385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77385\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Like in Justice’s flawless set the following night, you could feel the Franco-groove DNA Breakbot shares with Daft Punk flowing through their showstopping performance in the Gobi. Though Breakbot is technically the solo project of Thibaut Jean-Marie Michel Berland, the full band that joined the leveled tiers of his picturesque stage set-up filled out the lush, energetic sound of his songs. Vocalists Irfane and Yasmin matched and cranked up the vigorous boogie of their audience, maintaining crystal clear vocals while dancing in step with the guitarist and bassist. Yasmin and Irfane (in his salmon pink suit matching Berland’s all-white one) balanced the stoic expertise of Berland on the keys, and by the time they broke into their hit “Baby I’m Yours,” everyone in the crowd had tossed their inhibitions off like the sweat on their brows.</p>\n<p>One of the most anticipated performers of the weekend, legendary composer Hans Zimmer brought “a cello concerto to the desert,” and then some. With over 30 people on stage, including a full orchestra and choir, Zimmer led the Outdoor audience through intricate arrangements of scores from movies like “The Lion King,” “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Inception.” Though perhaps not everyone in the festival crowd was ready for Cellochella, as depending on where you were standing the people around you might’ve continued their roaring babble over the performance.</p>\n<p>The act that everyone was waiting for all weekend blew Coachella away on Sunday night. Kendrick Lamar, indisputably the greatest rapper of our time, had an easy go cementing his pinnacled place in not only the game but in his genre, his art and his work. Decked out in matching black-and-white Chinese martial arts uniforms to fit the Kung Fu Kenny persona carried through DAMN., he launched mercilessly into cuts from the new album and classics alike. Lamar rapped “DNA.,” “XXX.” and “ELEMENT.” with as much finesse and precision as “Backseat Freestyle,” “untitled 02” and his remix of “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” The weekend two crowd was privileged with a little more time to learn all the new lyrics. Kendrick interluded his show with campy, old-school style clips of Kung Fu Kenny on a mystic journey for ass and self-realization. The commitment to the (slightly questionable) character puts Kendrick in the frame of an artist with eras, phases of a long and storied career.</p>\n<p>But Coachella is also about the art (guys, it’s, like, in the name).</p>\n<p>The Antarctic, a “360° audio-visual sensory experience” by San Francisco studio Obscura Digital, was easily one of the most landmark attractions (musical or otherwise) to hit the fest in years. Known for large-scale projection mapping projects on canvases like the Empire State Building and St. Peter’s Basilica, the Obscura team brought the display of their show to the desert. Audiences filled up an air-conditioned dome for a planetarium show tricked out with innovative computer graphics tech and tripped out with breathtakingly morphing psychedelic imagery. It launched viewers up out of the desert Space Mountain-style, into intricately dreamlike landscapes with floating shapes, both organic and geometric, until eventually blurring the lines between the two past the point of differentiation. This breaking down of the barrier between the natural and the mathematical was appropriate in a space so simultaneously rawly human and exhaustively digitized as Coachella.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77386\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219748817\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77386\" data-attachment-id=\"77386\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=2048%2C1408&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1408\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=888%2C611&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77386\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01-250x172.jpg?resize=250%2C172\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77386\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>The Antarctic revived the kineticism of Coachella art, which was missing on the field this and last year, in the digital zone (it acknowledged this self-referentially by folding into its fourth-dimensional collage some iconic figures of years past: the caterpillar, butterfly and spaceman that moved across the grounds like giant floats). This forces the question of how much of the festival, and how much of our lives, exists within the digital space and to what degree we consider that part of an objective sense of reality. There was, appropriately, a lot of heady stuff in all those planes of color and fractals. Said one UCSB third-year, “From now on, whenever I trip I’m gonna call it ‘going to the Antarctic.’” However, he was upset that after hitting the dome three times in one day he “still never got uploaded to the singularity.”</p>\n<p>“Is this what brings things into focus?” is the name for the boxy herd of multi-patterned creatures that populated your Instagram feed this week. They were built by U.K. artists Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan. In person, these grazing six-story monsters were much more towering than photos could do justice to, playing with the scope and perspective of an actual event and the hyper-documentation of it. Compounded with the outward expansion of the festival’s grounds, these monumental sculptures gave one a tilt-shifted impression of their small space on the fields. No matter how big you look in that photo, at Coachella you’re a drop in a wave.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/","id":6805,"author":{"id":703,"name":"Frankie Horne"},"related":[6804,6803,6802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Raging Bull’ Takes on Violence with Movie Magic","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-08-at-12.31.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-08-at-12.31.10-PM.png?resize=684%2C515&ssl=1","description":"Ultimately, it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMotta’s life through the 23 years used to account his rise and fall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the 1970s, director Martin Scorsese burst into the film industry with a promising future. Collaborating with actor Robert De Niro on works such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, the duo consolidated their strong director-actor relationship early on in their careers. This collaboration lasted well into their respective careers — their big collaboration film of the ’80s is the now-classic Raging Bull.</p>\n<p>Based on the real-life story of boxer Jake LaMotta, Raging Bull recounts various fights and life events that marked the rise and fall of the renowned boxer. On Thursday, April 20, UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center hosted makeup artist and UCSB alumnus Michael Westmore to discuss the making of the movie with film and media studies professor Anna Brusutti.</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A discussion after the screening of the film, Brusutti remarked that one of the main themes in the film is the idea of violence. During the first match of the film, Scorsese hints at the violent nature of the boxing matches that will influence LaMotta’s personal life. In the first boxing match alone, the hectic nature of the event suggests that the audience demands to see this violence for their own enjoyment. At the beginning of the film, the audience already knows that LaMotta has a violent side as he displays a verbal attack (and small physical one) toward somebody early on the film. While a montage later in the film can be interpreted as a passage of time, it could also suggest a part of his life when his violent nature began to slowly build inside in context of this theme, as suggested by the various fights interlaced into the sequence. Ultimately, Scorsese also proves that violence is an endless cycle that can influence others to act similarly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Most of this is demonstrated through LaMotta’s personality and De Niro’s portrayal. As a character, LaMotta is brutal in the ring yet controlling outside. It’s almost as if Scorsese is trying to make the point that LaMotta was a product of a society that wanted him to beat people mercilessly to gain acceptance from them. As a result, LaMotta exerted complete control over those he loved, as demonstrated when he questioned any time his second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) kissed other men as a form of greeting or remarked that someone was simply good-looking.</p>\n<p>While LaMotta’s character on paper would be enough to show this change, it was De Niro’s dedication to the role that made the finished performance more meaningful. Westmore remarked, “[De Niro] trained so thoroughly that trainers were saying, ‘He could actually go into the ring [and] he probably would win.” While it is commonly accepted for actors to fully dedicate themselves to a certain role such as weight loss, Westmore reminisced on various times when De Niro would want the most minute parts of his character to be as accurate as possible.</p>\n<p>In one aspect of filming the movie, De Niro wanted his hair to look like LaMotta’s instead of wearing a wig. Westmore explained spending hours trying to rearrange De Niro’s hair to look as accurate as possible. For one scene, Brusutti noted a discontinuity in the flow of the scene which involved confetti. Both Scorsese and De Niro wanted to keep the confetti on LaMotta’s face, and the scene ended up taking 10 days to shoot because Westmore had to put confetti on De Niro’s face every shoot.</p>\n<p>While De Niro’s performance helped note the certain points of LaMotta’s life that led him to a violent path, the sound in the film was used well to make audience members hear the impact of his destructiveness. One can hear all the punches hit, as the sound is what can give audience members the reaction the movie wants them to have. In one scene involving LaMotta’s brother slamming someone’s head with a car door, one does not see the person affected by this action. However, with the sound, one can clearly picture the possible image in his or her head.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMotta’s life through the 23 years used to account his rise and fall. Regarding its use of violence, one can see the effect the punches in the ring have on a boxer. Westmore explained how he used tubes on De Niro’s face for the bloody punches. Even though the film is shot in black and white, the showcasing of blood is still effective for the plot of the movie, as there is little color contrast as suggested by Westmore at the discussion, and brings about a more poetic style to the scenes.</p>\n<p>However, the makeup is also used for the most subtle details in the film. Westmore uses it for smaller moments, such as the makeup done to LaMotta to show his roughness and Vickie to show her purity. He also uses his skills in makeup to create front cast-ons to make De Niro appear older than he is. Westmore explained that the real LaMotta’s skull was thicker than most men’s.</p>\n<p>At the time the film was released, Westmore had tried to bring makeup to the forefront. Westmore was given a special Oscar for his efforts in this film. A year after this film was released, the Oscars created the “Best Makeup and Hairstyling” category. In addition to the screening and Q&amp;A, some of the makeup work and props used for the film were on display, such as notes for “Sugar Ray” Robinson, makeup and three prosthetic noses.</p>\n<p>Westmore even explained to the audience that Raging Bull was more of a documentary, as there were people involved in the real events who helped inform the cast and crew of what actually happened. Indeed, it’s no wonder that UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center wanted to screen this film, additionally inviting Westmore, who provided audience members insight into the process of filmmaking through his personal experiences.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/","id":5827,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5826,5825,5824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two Door Cinema Club Brings Spring to Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jack Garratt, Grouplove and Two Door Cinema Club used their enthusiastic presences to entertain an amphitheater of dancing wine moms, and college kids who wanted to re-live their Tumblr indie years.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During the past week, the Santa Barbara Bowl has become a pre-game destination before propelling to Coachella. Two of these Coachella acts who paved their way to the SB Bowl were summery, synth-heavy alt-pop acts Grouplove and Two Door Cinema Club. Jack Garratt, Grouplove and Two Door Cinema Club used their enthusiastic presences to entertain an amphitheater of dancing wine moms, and college kids who wanted to re-live their Tumblr indie years. The lineup of performers unleashed their stellar sets without the inconvenience of the Indio dust in your eyes at the SB Bowl last Friday, April 14.</p>\n<p>The first act of the night, Jack Garratt, swooned the audience with looping effects — his method of capturing a multi-instrumentalist dynamic without having a band to join him. Garratt’s wholesome, artistic quality was displayed through his performance of “Worry,” which illuminated his ability to control the blending of electronic soul and pop production aspects to hit and sing the lyrics with heartfelt falsettos, in which his deeply-rooted sentiments could be felt throughout the crowd of 4000 concert-goers. A tender performance of “Surprise Yourself,” led to people closing their eyes out of pure euphoria and basking in the singer’s vocals that parallel those of a church choir.</p>\n<p>Charging up the stage with their monumental energy, Warm Up alumni Grouplove performed their radiant hits, allowing the audience to stand up from the foot-tapping, chair-laden positions they assumed during Garratt’s opening performance. Grouplove’s first song, “Borderlines and Aliens,” is a single from the 2013 album Spreading Rumors and allowed the swaying crowd that was warding off its momentum to dance a jolt of necessary energy. “Borderlines” was the punch the crowd desperately needed to grow used to the energy required to sing along to Grouplove’s adrenaline-filled songs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

A collective applause was heard and pretzels were put down for a couple of seconds once people reacted to hearing the first chords of Grouplove’s well-known hit, “Tongue Tied.” The triumphant look of happiness was visible on everyone’s faces, and the contagious spread of smiles was clear. For that moment, the audience was able to forget their worries about getting out of the Bowl’s treacherous parking lot and merely place their focus on a band that exudes joy.</p>\n<p>Hannah Hooper, one of Grouplove’s lead vocalists, shouted into the crowd, “Heavy shit happens, we’re all going through that shit. Life is beautiful, it can be a fantasy. This is what Grouplove is all about.

To wrap up their performance, Grouplove chose to close their set with a song that single-handedly represents the band’s vibrant aesthetic, “Colours.” The anthem, which called for the back-and-forth swaying of arms, ended the band’s set list of happy tunes.</p>\n<p>The brief 30-minute intermission between Grouplove and Two Door Cinema Club’s performances allowed for the crowd to reunite by collectively singing to 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” and dancing sporadically to R. Kelly’s “Ignition.”</p>\n<p>As we were both laughing at the displays of camaraderie within this show and anticipating the arrival of Two Door Cinema<img data-attachment-id=\"77171\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/tdcc-by-jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TDCC by Jenny Luo 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-77171\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> Club, a Montecito wine mom sat next to me. She then let me in on the reason why she was attending this particular concert: “Man, I feel old here, but I’ve loved [Two Door Cinema Club] ever since my son showed me their song ‘Sleep Alone.’” Then, a stream of blinding lights that should have come with a warning label began to mercilessly shine into the eyes of the audience, indicating the time we were waiting for was near.</p>\n<p>Two Door Cinema Club opened their set with the percussion-based song, “Cigarettes in the Theatre.” The claps heard in the instrumentation of the second song were undeniably recognizable; they marked the band’s performance of “Undercover Martyn,” one of their beloved pop masterpieces, which has achieved 56 million streams on Spotify. Despite the song’s theme of social isolation, the intensified energy was felt within the crowd. A sense of community could quite literally be felt throughout the arena in the waves that rippled from the back of the crowd to its tip.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77128\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77128\" data-attachment-id=\"77128\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/tdcc-by-jenny-luo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TDCC by Jenny Luo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77128 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TDCC-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77128\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A glimpse into the vibrant aesthetic behind the band was displayed through the projected fluorescent light spectrums on the seven pillars behind them. These pillars were not just a mere background to the band, but they also provided an art background that pleasantly accompanied their music. The audience was bathed in lights across the color spectrum from purple to neon blue, which symbolized the theme of the band’s latest album, Gameshow. The track “Bad Decisions,” best known for playing within a scene of the 2016 film “The Edge of Seventeen,” illuminated the interplay of guitar and synth melodies.</p>\n<p>Two Door Cinema Club finalized the night with an encore of their biggest hit in their catalog, “What You Know,” and gave an a capella rendition of the fan favorite.</p>\n<p>In an era where many are often afraid of not capturing every moment on Snapchat, there were rarely any phones in sight during the Two Door Cinema Club show. The crowd was completely invested in living in the moment rather than prioritizing the preservation of such moments. Crowd-pleasing performances were the center Friday night at the Santa Barbara Bowl, giving the acts and audience alike an appetizer before the feast of Coachella.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/two-door-cinema-club-brings-spring-to-santa-barbara/","id":6701,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6700,6699,6698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Travis Scott’s Birds Eye View Soars Over SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9961-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9961-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Scott, as a performer, was up to his usual standard, as he screamed every lyric with ease and moved quickly around the stage with high energy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The general energy for rap sensation Travis Scott has been anything but subtle recently. His last album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, was a huge success, and, more importantly, his recent tour announcement has had the hip hop world buzzing furiously. The 805 has been particularly excited with his seemingly out-of-the-way first stop of the tour at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Along with the rest of the shows on the tour, the Santa Barbara date sold out quickly — the floor seats sold out in a few minutes — and the performance put on by Scott was exactly as hyped as was anticipated.</p>\n<p>When I arrived around 7:30 p.m., the Bowl was already filled with students and hip hop fans, many sporting old Saint Pablo Tour and Travis Scott merch and an expected amount of overpriced streetwear, like Bape and Supreme. I immediately hopped in the long, winding merch line and, after about 20 minutes, I bought a few things. I later found out that, much like the Saint Pablo Tour, each city will have its own unique merchandise on sale for the audience. I then made my way to my seat to wait anxiously while some other rap hits played in the background.</p>\n<p>Travis’s DJ, Chase B, came out to amp up the crowd around 8 p.m. with some pre-concert bangers. His first selection, Young Thug’s heavy “Danny Glover,” hit the hardest and had the general admission floor moving aggressively. Among the other songs that Chase dropped were Lil Uzi Vert’s captivating ballad of “XO Tour Life” and, what is now clearly an essential at any high-energy event, Future’s earth-shattering “Mask Off.” After a good 30 minutes or so of Travis preparation, it was finally time for the dark horse of hip hop to make an appearance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

After security quickly ran over to escort him out, Scott shooed them away and then angrily commanded them to “get the fuck off my stage.” The lucky fan then jumped into the crowd right at the drop of “Upper Echelon” in what I can imagine was the craziest personal experience of the night. This gimmick was quickly overdone, however, as too many fans after tried to get on stage and abuse the experience by overstaying their welcome, coming on at the wrong times or trying to take pictures with the performer, which was highly discouraged by Travis.</p>\n<p>Among the other hits played were the slow Travis staple, “90210,” Rodeo standout, “On My Dis Side” and lean-cup anthem “Sweet Sweet.” Every track that was played dropped hard and was met with screaming, jumping and aggressive water-bottle chucking from the man of the hour. The crowd always responded appropriately with some alarmingly large mosh pits and vibey dancing from those higher up in the seated areas. Scott, as a performer, was up to his usual standard, as he screamed every lyric with ease and moved quickly around the stage with high energy.</p>\n<p>Around the middle of the show, Travis mysteriously took what looked to be a giant stuffed plush insect from behind the DJ stand and walked it back to the mysterious giant cage that served as a backdrop for the stage. He held it up to the cage for a giant mechanical bird claw to reach out and grab, and a huge mechanical bird similar to the one on his website was soon revealed behind the cage flapping its wings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77147\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77147\" data-attachment-id=\"77147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/img_9937/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9937\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The heaviest and most popular bangers were saved for last, as “3500,” “beibs in the trap,” mega-hit “Antidote” and Kendrick-featured “Goosebumps” were among his final performances. He also included his wildly popular collaboration with Young Thug and Quavo, “Pick Up the Phone,” which involved him running up into the middle of the seated crowd. However, the peak of his show was right before these last songs, when the giant bird emerged from behind the cage and came to center stage, flapping its wings and lighting its eyes up. Travis then climbed on top of the winged beast and led the crowd in what were easily the two rowdiest songs of the night.</p>\n<p>As far as the performance goes, no one in attendance could complain. Travis put on a crazy show, and the crowd was ready for the ride. Although the set was a little bit too short for the respective buildup, the show was still as incredible and ridiculous as I hoped. This tour will likely go down as one of the recent greats of the hip hop world, along with Kanye’s Saint Pablo and Drake’s Summer Sixteen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/","id":6702,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6701,6700,6699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Phantogram Performs Haunting Indie-Pop at Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Phantogram brought an impressive set to the Arlington, incorporating a plethora of sounds from their various influences and inspirations.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Dream pop duo Phantogram showered spacey reverberations over Santa Barbara’s Arlington Theater Tuesday night. In the wake of their Coachella performance, Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel brought an assortment of tracks to the venue, mostly those featured on their latest LP, Three. This is the band’s third studio album from a discography full of successes scattered over the past several years. The group’s sound is airy, atmospheric and eclectic. It is in a barn in upstate New York, near their home of Greenwich, where the duo writes and records their sounds. Within this music one can observe the influence of artists such as David Bowie, Sonic Youth and J Dilla. Phantogram’s collaborative history is impressive: working with figures like Outkast’s Big Boi and The Flaming Lips, in addition to being sampled by Kanye West and A$AP Rocky.</p>\n<p>A new creative direction came to fruition for the group with the release of Three, a project that helped refine sounds of melodic electronica and pop-rock that were explored on previous projects like Eyelid Movies and Voices. Opening for Phantogram was local Santa Barbara garage rock band Clean Spill. The quartet ripped through surf-flavored, animated indie cuts as a mob of what appeared to be the members’ friends cheered ecstatically. As Clean Spill concluded their set, the Phantogram team began to strip down the stage, postulating a more minimal appearance and coating the stage and its backdrop in white cloth. The drum set and synth were elevated, giving the stage more depth and pulling the front closer to the crowd. Concertgoers steadily filed into the auditorium, clutching their drinks as they found their spots in the red velvet seats of the Arlington. There was no time to waste as the entirety of the crowd planted their feet and jolted upward to greet Phantogram’s vibrant entrance.</p>\n<p>The duo kicked off their set with an energetic rendition of “You’re Mine,” during which Barthel and Carter each oscillated between a duality of voice and instrument. The crowd reciprocated the track with vivacious singing and dancing, many attendees never missing a lyric. One of the most notable aspects of Phantogram’s performance was their live visual production. An amalgamation of psychedelic lights and projections saturated every inch of the venue, allowing the audience to delve deeper into the band’s richest sonic elements.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Barthel and Carter were warm in their interaction with the audience.

At one point, a father carried his son to the front of the venue and shared the endearing moment with the duo, lovingly swaying to the music.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77146\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2009833561\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77137\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77146\" data-attachment-id=\"77146\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/phantogram-performs-haunting-indie-pop-at-arlington/phantogram-04-by-william-emmons-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Phantogram.04 by William Emmons\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77146\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phantogram.04-by-William-Emmons-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77146\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Another highlight of the show was the track “Don’t Move.” The song’s whimsical vocal samples heightened the emotional glow of the room and posited warm sentiments to all in attendance. Additionally, Barthel’s vocal skill bled through on the cut, exhibiting a dynamic range of tones and cadences. Perhaps the most encapsulating moment of the performance was “When I’m Small.” A dusty drum loop pulsed as Barthel exhibited angelic vocals and Carter ripped sharp leads on guitar. As the duo’s set neared an end, they encouraged attendees to dance to the song “Calling All,” the closer to Three. The empowering refrain of this track was accompanied with a colorful projection of lyrics onstage, evoking high-soaring energy across the aura of the theater.</p>\n<p>For an encore performance, Carter centered himself at the front of the stage with nothing but a microphone. Nostalgic home videos covered the stage’s backdrop, and the band slowly built up a touchingly beautiful sound that came to be “Barking Dog,” a song that seems to touch on pain, depression and suicide. Afterward, the band performed crowd-pleasing hits like “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore” to wind the show down.</p>\n<p>Phantogram brought an impressive set to the Arlington, incorporating a plethora of sounds from their various influences and inspirations. Their performance was colorful, impassioned and energetic. Carter and Barthel’s own influence is sure to expand as they navigate even more worlds of sound in their future music.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

The distinct, contrasting colors and clean faces from director John Hughes’s work or Netflix’s recent teen drama “13 Reasons Why” create romanticized ideas about a campus atmosphere that, by most people, is not actually experienced in reality. On Thursday, April 13, UCSB’s Pollock Theater presented a Script to Screen for director Kelly Fremon Craig’s 2016 film “The Edge of Seventeen,” which portrays high school slightly more honestly.</p>\n<p>This film follows Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) as she tries to navigate her junior year of high school. Various conflicts or situations involving her brother (Blake Jenner), her best friend (Haley Lu Richardson), a few classmates (Hayden Szeto and Alexander Calvert and one of her teachers (Woody Harrelson) arise and help her break out of her introverted, envious personality to become a more open-minded person.</p>\n<p>With her character’s personal problems well established, Steinfeld is able to convey the struggles experienced by average high school students, showing passionate emotions on screen. Craig attended a Q&amp;A discussion that occurred after the screening, and a part of the filmmaking process she extensively talked about was casting and working with the actors, especially Steinfeld. Craig explained that little touches, such as a look or an aside, really distinguished Steinfeld from many other actresses of her age. This was so special to Craig when considering how stressful the casting process was for her up until Steinfeld came to audition.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I spent a year seeing it and thinking … I don’t think we can make the movie because we just can’t find her,” Craig explained to Pollock Theater director Matt Ryan during the discussion.</p>\n<p>With regards to the supporting actors in the film, Craig seemed to have an easy time working with them, whether this was their first film or one of many projects. She discussed how some of the better moments in the film, from a remark concerning a Ferris wheel to a pencil sharpening, came about because of the actors’ improvisation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77156\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"458276784\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77154\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77156\" data-attachment-id=\"77156\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/edge-of-seventeen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"edge of seventeen\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77156\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The New York Times</p></div>\n<p>Explaining the way she worked with the actors, she told Ryan, “The greatest thing is when you haven’t said anything and then they do something that [makes] you go, ‘Holy shit! That’s so much better,’ so I never want to step on that moment. I ended up not doing a lot of rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>This work mentality displays the good results that come about when actors and directors collaborate well with each other when making the film.</p>\n<p>Craig illustrated the complexity of these characters when Ryan asked her about any advice she would give to aspiring screenwriters. She explained that thinking about how the film would be if a side character was the main character can provide you with a perspective on what they want. “A lot of times, when you’re writing those peripheral characters, it’s easy to just think about whatever you’re trying to accomplish with the main character [with] these people helping you with it,” she explained. She talked about how imagining them as the hero is important to make them more complicated.</p>\n<p>It is important that the characters be this intricate and complicated because the actor’s delivery and expressions are crucial to having the audience truly feel the message of the movie. Given the setting, the message of the film is relatable to anyone who has ever been through high school. The idea that students believe they know everything about people and think they are alone is a problem that can mentally affect them. There are students who may feel as if they do not belong to a certain graduating year or group of friends because of assumptions they build up about their peers.</p>\n<p>Craig explained how this theme tied back to Nadine’s character arc, saying, “Particularly at that age, you can really feel like that’s the truth, and then you start to realize that everybody in the world is carrying some sort of pain. Everybody’s been through something tough regardless of how they present [themselves].”</p>\n<p>While the film does have a central message it wants Nadine to realize, Craig also uses moments in Nadine’s arc to address other problems or illustrate tropes associated with the current generation’s high school environment.</p>\n<p>Certain turning points in various relationships Nadine has with other supporting characters are also executed while showing a certain contemporary idea. For example, the film deals with the modern issue of sexual assault in high schools. When shooting a scene involving this topic, Craig had a conversation with the two actors involved before filming it because she wanted to be as honest about the situation as possible. She wanted to show the scene in such a frank way because she believed “if you’re tiptoeing or you’re awkward it just makes the whole thing awkward.” Indeed, to address a problem this tragic, one would not want to shy away from depicting the moment.</p>\n<p>Craig clearly showed both passion and dedication to this project, going so far as to spend six months in a high school to truly capture the spirit of the modern teenage environment. “The Edge of Seventeen” brought a fresh new look into a genre of films that have been known to have many clichés attached to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/","id":5826,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5825,5824,5823],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Evan Tan: In Living Color","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Visual Art","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.27.12-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.27.12-AM.png?resize=803%2C605&ssl=1","description":"Rather than hiding in the darkness, Tan has a penchant for illuminating the world with saturated color.

The dreamy content of the images are all credited to the 17-year-old Tan, who travels with his cameras to document the scenes he immerses himself in. In an era when many of the emerging talent are late 90s and 2000s babies, Evan Tan is moving toward the forefront of the spectrum, creating a world that chooses to illuminate flaws rather than mask them. Evan Tan spoke to Artsweek about his goal to display people of all shades, capturing the humanity in his subjects and how music shapes the way he engages with his camera.</p>\n<p>Tan’s first venture into the world of photography started with filmmaking.</p>\n<p>“I started off my artistic career in filmmaking,” he said. “I left high school and the country to work on a student-led documentary in Nepal as a cinematographer.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

In response to this thought, Tan said, “I believe everyone has interesting lives; I just capture moments of mine. Everything you see is my real honest life. I don’t think about planning much, I just live my life and whatever happens happens.”</p>\n<p>When we find ourselves in a pivotal moment of our lives, we often lack the comfort and talent to capture these grand times.  Tan is known to carry around four bags with him at all times, stating, “I usually have my camera within a few feet from me at all times, but I like to give her a break sometimes. I treat my camera like I’m in a relationship with it. Sometimes it won’t work and then we’ll both fight and not talk for a while, and then I’ll pick it up and we’ll get back to working together.”</p>\n<p>Embedding oneself into the world of capturing artists when they are off the stage on which they perform is a rarity, yet Tan has etched his place in the world of capturing iconic photos of his artist friends. The magic within his photos lies in his naturalistic approach, in that he aims to show facets of his subjects that other photographers would conceal.</p>\n<p>“I love blemishes. I love imperfections and things that make anyone different,” states Tan, “I want my art to be honest, and I believe that people are the most beautiful in their natural state.”</p>\n<p>“I look at my photography as if I live inside my own universe where I’m the only one with the ability to see. Colors, people, places and shapes are constantly being filtered through my mind, and I use those to create images.” Tan creates an atmosphere with his subjects that allows individuals to display their carefree elements.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76889\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1576600177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76886\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76889\" data-attachment-id=\"76889\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/evan-tan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=1276%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1276,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"evan tan 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=888%2C668&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76889 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2-250x188.jpg?resize=250%2C188\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?w=1276&amp;ssl=1 1276w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Evan Tan</p></div>\n<p>For example, Tan recently photographed his friend, singer-songwriter Steve Lacy of The Internet, on the set of his “Ryd/Dark Red” music video. On the topic of the spontaneity of capturing the unfiltered moments with Steve on film, Tan said, “I texted him and then he dropped a pin and I just showed up and hung out for, like, half an hour. I just shoot my friends, and a lot of them happen to be artists. I record people in moments in my life, and I allow everything to naturally fall into place; I don’t like planning much.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the most iconic photograph he has ever taken, Tan considered his work and said, “The most iconic moment I have ever shot would be this photo I have of Jaden Smith. He had his Super 8 with him and we hiked this mountain in Calabasas, and I took a photo of him shooting me. The sky is a perfect color and the full moon is visible just over his head; it’s a perfect photo.”</p>\n<p>The romantic essence of shooting on 35mm film provides valuable glimpses into scenarios one would want to escape to and relive.</p>\n<p>“I think shooting on film is the most romantic thing. It’s a relationship that exists between the photographer and the subject that none else in the world can have,” he said, adding, “When you’re shooting on film, every exposure costs something, so every moment is intense and is intertwined with each other.”</p>\n<p>Rather than hiding in the darkness, Tan has a penchant for illuminating the world with saturated color.</p>\n<p>“I love working with naturally found bright colors. I find this wide selection of colors in people and my everyday surroundings. I shot one roll of black-and-white film a while back, but I realized after developing that I would stick with color forever,” the photographer said.</p>\n<p>Music defines our individuality and existence, and the vessel of music in Tan’s life influences the physicality of his content. On the coexistence of music and his photography, he affirmed, “I listen to music every day almost at all times. Most of my friends are involved with music, too, so I’m surrounded by it constantly. I listen to different types of music when I want to feel different emotions and take photos with those feelings in mind.”</p>\n<p>Tan’s nonconformity allows him to relish in individuality. When asked about the differences between him and other photographers, Tan replied, “I think the difference between me and other photographers is that I do this one 100 percent because I enjoy doing this. I don’t make any money, I don’t have a job, I don’t plan things out; photography has become something I can use to express myself in infinite different ways.” He then said, in a moment of clarity, “A lot of people make art to make money or to be like someone else, but eventually, creatively, they will run dry.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76888\" style=\"width: 213px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"521014248\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76886\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76888\" data-attachment-id=\"76888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/evan-tan-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=750%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,925\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"evan tan 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=750%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1-203x250.jpg?resize=203%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?resize=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Evan Tan</p></div>\n<p>As for Tan’s goals in the future, he said, “Thom Yorke is a dream of mine to shoot, but I really want to shoot Frank Ocean.” Many photographers’ mass goal is to gravitate attention to their photos to usurp more opportunities, but he when someone views Tan’s images, “I want [viewers] to fall in love with me.”His age should not discredit his self-made accomplishments; he holds remarkable wisdom about the art of photography. His varied subjects are given a medium to be visible so that their beauty shines through the lens. Tan captures not only the heartbeat of Los Angeles but also the heartbeat of people whose faces remain invisible in magazines.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76886\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76886\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/","id":6527,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6526,6525,6524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"RL Grime Soundtracks A Sunny Deltopia Weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04.09.2017.FranciscoBarrera.WarmUp20.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04.09.2017.FranciscoBarrera.WarmUp20.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last Saturday’s hosting of heavy trap DJ RL Grime was a clear attempt to keep kids off the streets of I.V. during Deltopia; the students responded with immense praise.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB students should study hard, carry themselves well and, for the love of God, please lose the party reputation. The community knows this, the staff knows this, we know this. Last Saturday’s hosting of heavy trap DJ RL Grime was a clear attempt to keep kids off the streets of I.V. during Deltopia; the students responded with immense praise. As the high energy, sold-out crowd and consequently empty Isla Vista can attest, the plan was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Born with the less exciting name of Henry Steinway, RL Grime is an electronic music producer based out of Los Angeles. He blew up online in the early 2010s with his debut EP, Grapes, and his later hit remix of “Mercy” by Kanye West. Since then, he has risen to electronic superstardom amongst the likes of Flume and Major Lazer with his 2014 Void EP and, more specifically, his bass-heavy hits “Core” and “Tell Me.” He more recently was on the world-famous Coachella bill in 2016 as well as the electronic festival, Snowglobe, in Tahoe.</p>\n<p>RL Grime has recently joined the likes of legendary artists such as Snoop Dogg, Diplo and Anderson .Paak to perform at UCSB. It is also worth mentioning that opening act Destructo was also a solid addition to the show and brought a more narrow EDM-favoring crowd in early for some pre-Grime womps.<br>\nSecond-year Ryan Andrews explained, “EDM is a huge part of the culture here. We all love rap and rock as well, but it is really nice to get to come to see some legit festival quality DJs for such a cheap price.”<br>\nBut even for someone outside of the electronic culture, RL Grime provided a high-energy set that was difficult to dismiss for lovers of any genre.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>RL Grime, along with his elaborate assortment of heavy electronic drops, is an extremely talented mixer that wields a unique ability to incorporate other genres into his set. The skill that tends to unite communities is his constant integration of popular hip-hop into his electronic beats, which was made most prevalent with his smash hit remix of “Love Sosa” by Chief Keef. The general approach is to take the already infectious hook of a popular hip-hop song, throw it over a heavier and steady beat and use it as a segue to another electronic drop or melody. Grime has mastered this technique. The genres, which normally seem like polar opposites, were mixed seamlessly in his performance which kept the set flowing well and constantly captivating.</p>\n<p>Among the other songs sampled were throwback “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” by Kanye West, The Weeknd’s broken love ballad of “The Hills” and the new instant classic from Future, the beautiful “Mask Off.” These tunes kept the set dancy and vibrant as well, which can help with the common complaint of an electronic set being too monotonous or artificial. Destructo used the same technique but to a less frequent degree, most memorably with the addition of XXXTentacion’s controversial “Look at Me” amidst his pounding electronic bass.</p>\n<p>As a prominent artist in the UCSB community, RL Grime’s beats caused the audience to respond with vibes that were, for lack of a better term, electrifying, all night long. The student crowd had the same energy as any other typical RL Grime show: plenty of sweaty bodies jumping, moshing, screaming and borderline violently losing their minds to all of the gnarly beats that were dropped. Regarding the performance, Leah Bronstein responded simply yet elegantly: “It was grimey,” she stated, “grimey with a side of filth.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76894\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1628105958\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76893\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76894\" data-attachment-id=\"76894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/rl-grime-by-franciscobarrera-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"RL Grime by FranciscoBarrera 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76894\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Francisco Barrera / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As a music enthusiast and writer, I often feel that it is my given duty to dislike everything that the Electronic Dance Music phenomenon stands for. I’m inclined to believe that it is artificial, without any real message or intelligence and painfully repetitious. The idea of a concert where jumping is the only acceptable form of dancing and drugs are encouraged for enjoyment seems ridiculous to me, and I often find it easy to slouch back into my corner of artistic snobbery with all of the other non-believers. However, there is a lot to be admired here; RL Grime is amazing. The internet EDM hero brought together a ton of different kids with merely a laptop and creativity. He truly is an extremely talented mixer.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, I had way too much fun at this concert. The lights were dazzling, I was moving around like an idiot, I was hooked. The bass hit hard, people were going nuts and it was exactly what you would expect. Mesmerizing seems to be the only word to describe my experience as I was constantly finding myself lost in the sheer euphoria that was presented to me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/","id":6699,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6698,6697,6696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Homeshake Brings Silky Sounds to Storke","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Homeshake does not boast a sound that is daytime-ready, but nonetheless, the soulful melodies were pleasantly warm.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Monday, the steps descending to the bottom of Storke Tower rapidly filled with denim-covered bottoms and sneaker-clad feet. Passersby stared into the space in front of the tower, wondering why the crowd had gathered — especially since it was prime time for lunch or afternoon classes. The eager group, some of whom had sacrificed both food and learning, was awaiting an afternoon set from Homeshake, the synth-pop project of singer and multi-instrumentalist Peter Sagar.</p>\n<p>Homeshake, currently on tour behind Fresh Air, made a quick stop here in Santa Barbara, presented as part of the noon concert series. This show continues a tradition that is 30 years strong; Program Board’s noon Storke shows started in the early ’80s. The campus population’s music tastes have, of course, changed since then, so the ASPB team tries to account for our wide variety of tastes. Justin Taing, Program Board’s special events assistant, said that his goal is to “get a good mix of local and traveling bands, a combination of my own tastes and people I think would be a good fit.” It is also important for himself and ASPB as a whole to keep in mind the flexibility that the open space of Storke provides in terms of audience accessibility and movement. As anticipation for Homeshake grew, the crowd was visibly pleased, content with Program Board’s appeal to their indie sensibilities.</p>\n<p>Homeshake began in 2013 with the release of The Homeshake Tape. Another cassette followed, and the project was eventually signed to indie label Sinderlyn, which released Homeshake’s debut album In The Shower. Before departing to focus on Homeshake, his misleading moniker for work that is mostly solo, Sagar was a guitarist for Mac DeMarco’s backing band. Echoes of DeMarco’s brand of slacker rock can occasionally be heard in Homeshake’s easygoing sound. In fact, Homeshake and DeMarco are part of a festival-favorite group of Canadian acts, including folk-pop singer Andy Shauf and dream rock band Alvvays.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While setting up the various pedals and effects boxes necessary for his woozy, warm sound, Sagar did not participate in much banter with the audience. He quietly worked on getting everything positioned just right, his thick yellow sweatshirt and khaki-colored pants almost inappropriate for the early April heat. Five minutes past noon, he signaled up to the makeshift soundbooth perched at the top step above Storke, and launched into the instrumental “Hello Welcome,” the opening track from Fresh Air. His bite-sized songs are a good fit for the hour-long slots for Storke shows, creating a set jam packed with tasty sounds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76892\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2105788950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76891\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76892\" data-attachment-id=\"76892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/homeshake-brings-silky-sounds-to-storke/homeshake/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"homeshake\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Min Xie / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Next on Homeshake’s short setlist was “Call Me Up,” a single that has become one of their most popular tracks. This song belongs on the suggestive playlists of college kids, particularly if they want to impress a girl or guy that’s into cool music. Over catchy, staccato synth notes that replicate the melody of the song, Sagar sings, “Any time you want to just call me up, and I’ll answer you.” His falsetto, manipulated heavily by his ensemble of electronics, melted seamlessly into the day. However, a few songs into the set, he commented that it was “weird playing in the sunlight.” Homeshake does not boast a sound that is daytime-ready, but nonetheless, the soulful melodies were pleasantly warm.</p>\n<p>At the first notes of “Khmlwugh,” a few cheers came from the front of the audience. The track is one of Homeshake’s sexiest and most instantly recognizable. Homeshake’s entire catalog flirts heavily with the sensual, but this song brings it to the forefront with a steady drum beat, unhurried keyboards and Sagar’s voice in its lower register. “Kissing, hugging, making love, waking up, getting high” is what the letters of the song’s unpronounceable title stand for. Homeshake has a charming way of marrying jazz fluidity and R&amp;B chill with soulful grooves. The songs’ warbling instrumentals paired with Sagar’s soft vocals serve as a foil to one another, but these elements are able to create contrast without tension.</p>\n<p>“Making a Fool of You,” from Homeshake’s debut In The Shower, was another familiar track, centered around a jam session bass line. By the middle of the set, a sizable group of people had formed in front of the speakers of the outdoor, makeshift stage, most of them having ditched their Vans to dance barefoot on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Although Sagar and his band moved through the set with little banter, presumably due to obvious time constraints, he did take time to thank everyone who was watching. Peering through his oversized, round, black sunglasses, he commented, “Pretty nice campus, congratulations. I hope you all have an easy time getting out of debt.” His dry sense of humor seems stifled in writing, but his joke was tinged with sincerity.</p>\n<p>Homeshake closed the show with the sunny, midtempo “Home at Last.” As I looked around at the moving bodies, tapping feet and nodding heads, I felt at home: a few weeks into a Santa Barbara spring with the sun shining like it never left in the first place.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” sets a shining standard of mediocrity for action films and further serves as proof that live-action manga adaptations (well, more like anime adaptations, in this case) are generally not good ideas. Of course, giving writing duties to one of the minds behind “Transformers” hardly helps. The final product is a substandard action film that drowns the humanistic themes of its source material under a deluge of headache-inducing CGI cityscapes and a painfully bland corporate conspiracy story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, the first person to have their brain inserted into a purely cybernetic body. As a result, she can hack into the cyberbrains of other people and has superhuman abilities. Basically, she’s playing Black Widow again, but now her skin-tight bodysuit is flesh-toned. After her transformation, the corporate mind behind the Major’s creation, Cutter, comes up with the brilliant idea of taking this investment he holds so dear to his heart and putting her in a counter-terrorism unit. Smart business move there, bud. Put your experimental business asset in a profession in which getting a bullet in the ass is right in the job description. Then again, what can one expect when the film’s idea of a pre-asskicking one-liner is “The truth is … I wasn’t built to dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Major spends the first third of her own screen-time questioning her humanity, a theme central to the original manga source material that depicts a world in which cybernetic augmentation is as common as wearing a watch. The film makes this abundantly clear to us by showing a variety of humans who have undergone some sort of modification or other: chips in the brain to play music, cybernetic eyes, stuff like that.

Every 10 minutes or so, you’re treated to the sight of gigantic, colorful holographic advertisements pulled straight out of “Blade Runner” and waving at you. Once, it’s cool. Twice, it’s artistic. Eight times and the scenery is not only overpowering whatever character is in the shot, but the movie is also treating you like a complete moron. Yes, I know it’s a sci-fi movie, thank you very much. Now get to the next scene before I decide to go sneak in to see “Logan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps my analysis is a little too harsh. The film is at least visually inventive and arresting, that much can be said. Holograms aren’t used in any groundbreaking story manner, but in small touches, like having them disintegrate like sand upon the end of a conversation, which lends at least a little personality to their measly existence.  And the Major’s deep dive, her hacking into another cyber-brain, provides for a darkly hallucinatory experience (albeit one that is, weirdly enough, evocative of both “Code Lyoko” and Kingdom Hearts)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all its attempts to divert your attention that there is little under the surface of this shell, the third act kicks in hard. As the pieces fall into place, things actually start getting at least a little interesting when the questions about the Major’s identity are answered. The thing is, as someone who was at least a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">familiar with the source material, I was able to see the twist coming from a mile off.  Maybe others won’t and will be blown away by it. The interesting question though, without giving too much away, is can a movie be truly accused of whitewashing when the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">character </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herself has been literally whitewashed?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the film does not seem to care about the implications, nor does the protagonist dwell upon her revelation. “Ghost in the Shell” is still a dumb action movie, ground into a pulp by the Hollywood wringer. It may look somewhat the same as Masamune Shirow’s work, but its soul has been rent and mangled, rendered unrecognizable. The best I can say about the movie is that it takes the indecipherable technobabble of its source material and trades it in for a couple of entertaining and occasionally seizure-inducing combat scenes.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fellow Artsweek writer Ryan Hykes rates this movie an 8/10.  And that’s why he writes album reviews.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/","id":5833,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5832,5831,5830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: More Life by Drake","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/df91da4c0c20709e276c25f1bb6ff87f.640x640x1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/df91da4c0c20709e276c25f1bb6ff87f.640x640x1.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1","description":"From rap to R&B to dancehall, he does it all on More Life, and he does it well.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh man. Oh man, oh man. Not again. Drake came back with his heavily anticipated </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “playlist,” which means Twitter and Spotify may need to increase bandwidth to accommodate the massive influx of traffic for the foreseeable future. The lengthy follow-up to the 6 God’s fourth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, features some heavy-hitters such as Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Travis Scott and more.

So to answer your question, Frank, in the context of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-era Drizzy, the king is everything to the god. Twenty-two tracks is Drake’s longest project to date. It could take months to consume all of that content. And it will. It’s all part of the plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake is a calculated artist. We must not forget that when the rest of the rap game sleeps, the 6 God schemes. And plots. All of this on the low, of course. He is a poster child for post-modernism; in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘s 80-minute lifespan, he crosses over to pop, switches back to rap, reveals insecurities, displays confidence and even borrows cultural accents. By calling the project a “playlist,” he grants himself immunity and freedom from the pressures of typical album expectations.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tsunami of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reviews will have already clogged your newsfeed by the time this is published. Don’t pay attention to most of them. Too many internet-dwellers simply turn a first impression into an arbitrary letter grade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reviewing the work of an artist as big as Drake, there is a major “micro vs. macro” distinction that must be addressed. A micro-level review pits an artist’s new release against his/her own discography, while a macro-level review compares a new project’s quality to that of recent releases from other contemporary artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, today’s Drake-related micro-level reviews would suggest that he can’t win. Just take a look at the Fifth Estate’s reaction to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite its unprecedented streaming success, the album caused many to long for an earlier incarnation of the artist. Old projects like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Care</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing Was the Same</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> set the bar high and left the door open for new releases to be overly scrutinized. Yes, some nostalgia-laden Drake reviews touch on valid points, but as with any bias reporting, viewer discretion is advised, at least to some degree.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is within the macro-level arena that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> evaluations can easily garner positive acclaim. Drake has become a master recording artist as both a singer and a rapper; he delivers contagious melodies and captivating flows. His unmatched versatility as a vocalist allows him to successfully execute multiple styles. From rap to R&amp;B to dancehall, he does it all on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and he does it well. There is a track for everyone, which is a major feat in and of itself. Name another rapper who can achieve such wide-ranging appeal … Now cue the crickets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the irresistibility of Drake’s content is largely due to the holistic quality of his compositions. Executive producer and long-time collaborator 40 delivers a signature OVO sound on a handful of the project’s tracks. Boi-1da, T-Minus and Nineteen85 are a few more usual suspects on the production side of the operation.

The website promoting the project states, “For some of these students, it is the beginning of an epic four-year journey, while for the others it is the end and the ultimate culmination of their college experiences. For all, however, it is a time of celebration and reflection.”</p>\n<p>For those of you who are unsure what a “visual album” consists of, it is essentially a series of music videos that come together to create a single story. The characters don’t have any dialogue; the story is told entirely through the songs used. And the music used for this short film is by a famous UCSB graduate whom we all know and love.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Danielle Erwin, a fourth-year film and media studies major and the producer of the project, said, “The music really drives the plot of the story with the lyrics and vibe of the song.

He’s kind of a legend in the community,” said Erwin. “We all just kind of fell in love with the project.”<br>\nAbout 15 minutes in length and told through five of Johnson’s songs, the project was initially created due to the negative media attention I.V. has received over the past several years. Co-director and writer of the visual album Connor Haines, a fifth-year in the film and media studies department, came up with the idea while Googling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If you ever Google-search Isla Vista, it’s not the greatest thing in the world,” Haines stated. “I was sitting in class one day, and that’s what I was doing. I felt like there needed to be more positive ideas of I.V. and UCSB. I was trying to think of ways to do that, and the idea of a visual album came to my head.”</p>\n<p>Explaining the album and comparing it to Beyoncé’s Lemonade or Frank Ocean’s Endless, Haines elaborated that he came up with a pitch for Jack Johnson to be able to use his music in a soundtrack about students’ lives on the last day of Spring Quarter. Erwin stated, “As seniors creating a love letter to UCSB and I.V., it was perfect to use Jack Johnson.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the team, Joe Palladino, the film and media studies advisor, was able to get in contact with Johnson’s wife, Kim, who then passed the message along to her husband.</p>\n<p>“[Palladino] sent the pitch I designed to Kim, and she emailed back and said that Jack and her were both on board for the project, and it was as simple as that. They got back to us the same day; it was amazing,” said Haines.</p>\n<p>Now that the group has the rights to Johnson’s music (using “Better Together,” “Rodeo Clowns,” “Staple It Together,” “Talk of the Town” and “Symbol in my Driveway”), they are starting the filming process.<br>\nHaines enthused, “For prospective students and parents, they don’t really get to see the experiences all the students have. The goal is to show what it really means to be a Gaucho.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76668\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"578485964\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76665\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76668\" data-attachment-id=\"76668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/ucsb-filmmakers-join-forces-with-jack-johnson/jack-johnson-film-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jack johnson film 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76668\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Mika Pham</p></div>\n<p>The visual album has already raised $1,875, and the group is continuing to fundraise for the project.<br>\nThe students working on the short film want it to carry the warmth and joy that makes Jack Johnson’s songs so special.

Their fundraising website expresses, “For us, this is a labor of love, and we will finish it no matter what.”</p>\n<p>Haines passionately concluded, “I.V. has gone through a lot in the last couple years.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is finally that time of the year again, folks. Spring Break has sadly come to an end, so we see ourselves fenced in for the first weekend back; however, in an effort to outweigh a multitude of rules and regulations comes the treat of a “welcome back” concert, with this year’s guests being RL Grime and Destructo. The third installment of this Gauchos-only event will commence Saturday in the Thunderdome at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Destructo has dutifully engineered his own approach to the EDM genre, with his music tending to interface with darker, more melodic sounds. This includes crossing over into genres EDM music typically contrasts with (similar to that of hip hop), creating a blend fans of either genre can approve of. His apparent hip hop influence becomes clear in features/videos with well-known hip hop artists like Warren G, YG and Ty Dolla $ign. Rather than just being a contributing factor to his songs, each individual artist he enlists serves as a critical ingredient to the vision he has mastered. It goes without saying that the West Coast EP would indeed not have been as equally compelling without the aid of highly established West Coast figures in the music industry.</p>\n<p>For those of us who are not too keen on the EDM genre, Destructo’s set is sure to be hip-hop-infused, making it a bit more palatable. Known for his generous utilization of colorful visuals and gas effects, you can guarantee this set will be one of “show” rather than “tell.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Los Angeles native Henry Steinway (also known as RL Grime), made his debut with the release of his first EP, Grapes, in 2012. Like Destructo, RL Grime has dappled in the combination of the hip hop and EDM genres through not only his numerous remixes of well-known hits, such as Chris Brown’s “Look at Me Now” and Rihanna’s “Pour it Up,” but in the production of music for hip hop artists Tory Lanez and Big Sean. He has caught the attention of publications like The Fader,and charted on both Billboard and iTunes.</p>\n<p>Although they certainly did not invent the traverse between EDM and hip hop music, each artist has undoubtedly added their own perspective on it. As a listener, there are certain details about production that go unnoticed/unappreciated in a piece, so this show may very well be an opportunity to make note of those details because they will assuredly be brought by both RL Grime and Destructo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/","id":6542,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6541,6540,6539],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two Door Cinema Club Arriving Next Friday","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The band’s legendary idols, Prince and Bowie, undoubtedly inspired the band to pay homage to the past generations of music that solidified their grandeur with enticing dancefloor anthems.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Irish guitar music and disco-pop are two soundscapes that juxtapose one another, yet Two Door Cinema Club melded their Irish roots with an electrified sound that enamored the indie realm. With festival season quickly emerging, Two Door Cinema Club will be taking the stage at the Santa Barbara Bowl with Grouplove on Friday, April 14.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The riveting synths and squealing guitars born from the trio’s latest project, Gameshow, takes listeners on a journey into a ‘70s disco time capsule. The album follows an infatuated journey of ‘70s music culture, hence the penchant for the enhanced synthesizers. The band’s legendary idols, Prince and Bowie, undoubtedly inspired the band to pay homage to the past generations of music that solidified their grandeur with enticing dancefloor anthems. Their past album, Tourist History, which was all too familiarized with the optimal time of being an edgy Tumblr teen, illuminated catchy pop sounds. This 2010 album made TDCC’s hit “Undercover Martyn” an inescapable track that was instantly sewn into our membranes. While “Beacon” and “Tourist History” immersed themselves into composing pop earworms, Gameshow pulls the same traction with a revisit to the golden era of hypnotic funk. Gameshow encompasses lyrics fueled by guarded emotions within the spectrum of compelling instrumental elements. The departure from their recognizable hook-heavy sound brought forth a confusion in many of TDCC’s listeners, who were interested in the comfort of the clash of rock and pop found on the debut album. Despite TDCC experimenting with far more surging synth in their latest project, the band has displayed their creative ambition to constantly seek out new ways to keep their music eclectically invigorating rather than conforming to making mediocre, radio-friendly songs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76657\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"100320227\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76655\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76657\" data-attachment-id=\"76657\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/two-door-cinema-club-costume-party/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?fit=2048%2C1149&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1149\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"two-door-cinema-club-costume-party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76657\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club-250x140.jpg?resize=250%2C140\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/two-door-cinema-club.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76657\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Two Door Cinema Club’s tourmates, Grouplove, are also masters of weaving their massive hits into the inner workings of our consciousness. Both bands have accomplished the ability to create catchy hooks with waves of sunshine. Two Door Cinema Club balances their contrasting forms of atmospheric and pop sounds; meanwhile, Grouplove is well-known for their hyperactive dream-pop that meanders its way into movie scenes to heighten a main character’s adventurous epiphany. Grouplove are no strangers to Santa Barbara, as they recently performed last year at UCSB’s Warm Up concert, which was synchronized with iconic hits and bold performances. Grouplove’s 2016 album titled Big Mess, proves to be the paradox to their popularized past discography, as the band has morphed into implementing more ‘90s rock instrumentation. The energetic atmosphere that Grouplove put out into their performances have the crowd radiating with anticipation to further hear the band’s musical catalog. In order to capture the audience’s attention, the members of Grouplove sporadically jump along and joyously clap to their own cheery melodies. When looking for a high calorie burn, just put yourself in the middle of Grouplove’s carefree dance pit.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A room-filling level of applause and drunken singing is expected to swell the SB Bowl with an imminent energy that will wake up the surrounding neighborhood. Two Door Cinema Club’s performances have been known to be rather psychedelic and provoke memories of the gateway indie band era when many young listeners were barely getting enveloped into the universe of alternative music. With visual backdrops to match their effervescent sound, Two Door Cinema Club and Grouplove are known to quickly enthrall an audience of thousands and have them swaying along in unison. If you are having an alt-music mid-life crisis and want to relive the era of gateway indie bands, join Grouplove and Two Door Cinema Club at the SB Bowl before they hit Coachella.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76655\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76655\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/two-door-cinema-club-arriving-next-friday/","id":6541,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6540,6539,6538],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":21,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
