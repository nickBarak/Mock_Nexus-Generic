Now, don’t get me wrong, there have been plenty of interesting, noteworthy shows that have happened there during that time, but something always happens to go wrong as I’m planning to make my way there. This time around, though, going to the Bowl was a must. Two acts from my high school iTunes days were making a stop at the Bowl on a joint headlining tour: The Flaming Lips and Mac Demarco.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While standing in line to receive my ticket, I already heard the opening lines to Mac’s now-classic “Salad Days.” His signature warbly guitar tones floated down to the bottom of the Bowl, and I grew more and more anxious to get to the top. As I walked up the steep slope, he was already churning through “Cooking Up Something Good,” a chilled-out set list staple that tells the story of a family who cooks methamphetamines in their home (yes, really). Blue and purple lights reminiscent of the ’80s reflected from the rotating disco ball that hung from the rafters of the stage, and shined onto every face in the audience — a display of the simple and slightly corny delight that is a Mac Demarco show. I had already seen him live twice before that night, but never in a true concert setting, only on large music festival stages. Hundreds of blonde and brown heads bobbed along to his music, making for a much more comfortable experience for the singer. With a beer in one hand, microphone in the other and a smile plastered across his face, he truly looked like he was having a good time.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The gap-toothed guitarist, matching with at least half of the audience, wore his standard uniform of a baseball cap, too-large trousers and an old t-shirt. Halfway through the set, he and his band began to churn through “Freaking Out the Neighborhood,” a slightly anxious, but very danceable tune about a slacker son. In many ways, this song embodies the Mac Demarco ethos: music with a lackadaisical attitude and hiding something simply brilliant. He skillfully and meticulously crafts the guitar riffs in all of his songs, and his smooth voice is able to soar high above them despite his notorious onstage cigarette habit. Although his antics are predictable — such as jumping from sound equipment and kissing bandmates — it is unfair to characterize him as untalented. His work ethic is impeccable, and his talent is obvious.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite his talent, I noticed some of the older audience members seemed less engaged with Demarco’s performance than the rest of the crowd. At first glance, a show billed with him and The Flaming Lips as headliners doesn’t make much sense. However, when you consider the sheer <i>weirdness</i> of both, it’s clear why they’d be a perfect fit. Toward the end of his set, Demarco mentioned that this was one of the last shows that he’d be playing with the Lips, and opening act The Garden. He thanked them both graciously and closed out his set with “Still Together,” a long-time, end-of-show tradition.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The intermission between acts was relatively short and was used to set up The Flaming Lips’ extravagant stage effects. From my vantage point, I could see large, colorful balloons waiting to be dropped down onto the audience, which explained the sign in the front of the venue encouraging patrons with latex allergies to make staff aware. Soon after the setup was complete, the Lips came onto the stage with a burst of color. Within five minutes of making their entrance, smoke, confetti and a flash of multicolored lights had already been put into gear. Wayne Coyne, the group’s frontman and leader, greeted the crowd with a shout, outfitted in a slim crimson colored suit, completing an appropriate entrance for a band oft-described as eccentric.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As the band presented a balloon that read “Fuck Yeah Santa Barbara” in big silver letters, they knew that the crowd was anticipating hearing their favorite songs. The Lips then launched into the fan favorite “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 1.” The titular Yoshimi serves as a sort of mascot for the band in her fight against the pink robots serving as a symbol for whatever the listeners may desire. The Flaming Lips have been active since the early ’80s, which means that its members are all nearing their sixties. Despite their graying hair and increasing age, however, they still approach shows with the same bright energy that they became famous for.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79103\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"789484251\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79101\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79103\" data-attachment-id=\"79103\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/the-flaming-lips-and-mac-demarco-ignite-sb-bowl/fl6v87fuug8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FL6V87FUUG8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79103\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FL6V87FUUG8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79103\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Throughout the course of the show, Coyne paid homage to the unconventional artists that have influenced himself and his band of misfits the most. He traveled across the crowd in a plastic, transparent bubble, a nod to the funk group Parliament Funkadelic, and performed a sonically faithful cover of “Space Oddity,” a tribute to the late, great David Bowie. The band closed their set with “Do You Realize??,” a sweet ballad which has been dubbed by Coyne as the best song they’ve ever written.</p>\n<p>The Flaming Lips and Mac Demarco put on a weird, wonderful show — one that lit up the Santa Barbara Bowl with bright lights, beautiful colors and smiles alike.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

It is difficult to see icons as human beings, and when they die, it sends palpable shockwaves throughout communities of fans and admirers. When ’80s rocker Tom Petty passed away last week, the first person I thought of was my father — his high school days were soundtracked by big radio hits by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, such as “Refugee” and “Don’t Do Me Like That.” Those songs mark a certain form of nostalgia for him, and of course, Petty’s death brought about a certain form of sadness. Tom Petty was one of the best selling artists of all time and was an iconic force in the second generation of classic rock and roll. My father’s reaction to Petty’s death made me think about the icons we have lost recently and how they have affected me personally. His reaction also made me come to this conclusion: It is okay to mourn for an artist whom you have never personally known because you have attached many of your own life moments to their art.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the beginning of Winter Quarter of my freshman year, the news broke that David Bowie had died of cancer. I remember a friend running down the hall and knocking on my door to tell me. I was in the shower, however, and my roommate relayed the news to me after I was finished. Bowie, similar to many of the enigmatic artists of his time, seemed to be someone who would always be around. He was able to float on the periphery of the music world, only descending when he was ready to create something new. But despite his ethereal aura, he was mortal like the rest of us and lost his battle with an awful sickness.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another thing that I’ve learned through the loss of other musical personalities is that the term “icon” is quite subjective. For example, to my father, Tom Petty was an icon, and he was to me, too, by extension. However, to someone who did not grow up with his music, his death does not resonate in the same way. Maybe there’s a sad thought, or a passing condolence, but that is pretty much where it ends. For my roommate, Bowie was just another old, famous singer who died of sickness, but to me, an idol was now gone forever.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The first is obvious: Compile a playlist of your favorite songs by the artist and share it with your friends who also like their music. You can take this even further by diving into their catalogue for B-sides, rarities and covers that you never listened to before. When Canadian singer-songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen, of “Hallelujah” fame, died, I searched for live performances and interviews during which he shared his wonderful, slightly irreverent wisdom. He once said, “Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.” When I read that, I realized that artists are more aware of their mortality than we are as fans. It is human nature to place those you admire on a pedestal, even if that leads you to forget that they, too, are human. Perhaps the most comforting thing of all is this thought: An artist never truly dies, as long as there are people who are enabling their art to live on. And as long as we, the fans and admirers, are here, that will always happen.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Eilish, just two days into the North American leg of her first-ever (and sold-out) world tour, graced the crowd with her self-described “gloom pop.” Opening for her was 23-year-old Brooklyn based Nigerian musician Thutmose. The genre-transcending artist hyped up the crowd with hard-hitting hip hop tracks like “Ok Ok” and showed his softer side with “Summer’s Gone” before free styling over the track of Kendrick Lamar’s ubiquitous summer banger, “Humble.” Eilish, who danced her way onstage to the theme song from “The Office,” appeased the restless crowd with her organic, ethereal sounds, as well as a few bass-heavy renditions of songs from her first EP </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dont smile at me. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eilish, though only 15, has already made waves in the music world. Her breakthrough single, “Ocean Eyes,” written by her brother Finneas O’Connell, generated over 40 million plays on Spotify and has been remixed by noteworthy artists blackbear and Astronomyy. Additionally, her song “Bored” was featured on the hit Netflix show “13 Reasons Why.” She has been christened “Pop’s Next It Girl” by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vogue</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and proclaimed “Most Impressive 15-Year-Old” by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billboard</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, what is perhaps most impressive about Eilish is that she is authentically herself (which is a major feat for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">young teen, let alone one baring her soul onstage every night.) Backed by cool synths and sparse acoustics, her distinct falsetto does most of the heavy lifting, often employing faint echoes to back up her breezy vocals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dressed in an oversized JOYRICH pullover, baggy checkered pants and thick gold chains, someone unfamiliar with Eilish’s music would be surprised by the juxtaposition of her skater boy style with her dream-like tunes. Backed only by her brother Finneas, the multitalented siblings kicked off their set with an upbeat rendition of “COPYCAT.”  They then launched into a more subtle and haunting version of “idontwannabeyouanymore.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite some technical difficulties, Eilish remained remarkably cool, playfully asking, “Is there a joke or something I can tell?” while waiting for the production crew to finish their adjustments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, Eilish has drawn comparisons to the queen of sad pop herself, Lana Del Rey, as well as fellow teen breakout artist Lorde. With her performance of “watch,” it is clear to see where these likenesses come into play. Eilish switched up her typical high notes with a lower register familiar to Del Rey and danced around stage with Lorde-esque body jerks. However, what sets Eilish apart from her contemporaries is her lack of theatrics, relying solely on her voice to capture and hold the audience’s attention – and capture their attention she did. This was the first of her songs that had the entire crowd swaying and singing along.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79035\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"283117248\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79034\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79035\" data-attachment-id=\"79035\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/billie-eilish-kicks-off-i-v-first-fridays-with-mellow-sounds/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?fit=960%2C638&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,638\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79035\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22308834_10155905415204558_4814068769053519358_n.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79035\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of AS Program Board</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the most memorable performances of the night was Eilish’s ukulele cover of Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” which second years Cameron Costello and Taylar Hender agreed was “soft and lowkey.” Eilish transitioned straight from her unexpected Drake cover into “party favor,” linking the two with the dial tone intro to the song. In this notably sassy performance, Eilish bops to an uncharacteristically strong beat, reminding the audience through her lyrics that she will not be treated like someone else’s property. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing about themes far beyond her years, listeners may wonder how Eilish can connect with complex issues such as love, heartbreak and other situations that may not personally affect her yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billboard,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the young songstress praised the importance of playing a character: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have to be in love with someone to write a song about being in love with someone. You don’t have to hate somebody to write a song about hating somebody. You don’t have to kill people to write a song about killing people. I’m not going to kill people, so I’m just going to become another character.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving her song “my boy,” for the end of her set, Eilish revamped the usually melancholy track by giving it a saucy makeover, which can only be described as pure fun. She hyped up the crowd with a funky sibling dance break and impressive vocal riffs. Closing out the performance were Eilish’s two most recognizable songs, “Ocean Eyes” and “Bellyache”. Her presentation of “Ocean Eyes” stayed true to the original, possessing a dreamy, underwater quality that still had the audience scream-singing along. “Bellyache” switched from its usual acoustic sound to a sick bass underlain in the chorus that closed out the show on a high note. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concertgoers as a whole were extremely impressed with Eilish’s set, many of them never having heard of her before that night. A common theme expressed was astonishment of her age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tess Gording, a first year, exclaimed, “Her music is totally relatable. She’s not even 16 and she’s this talented!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Third years Amanda Milianta and Nick Vaughan, both longtime fans of Eilish, were impressed by her performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Her demeanor and her stage presence were incredible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The takeaway: Billie Eilish made a lasting impression on residents of Isla Vista, and on their music tastes as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As second-year Quintin Romano said, “I’m definitely going to add some of her songs to my playlist.” </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

The crowd was predominantly late 20s and up, and I felt like a lost child at a concert compared to everyone else. I had a slightly rough time walking up the notorious Santa Barbara Bowl slope, and the visibly intoxicated crowd was also complaining about the hike up, making it a communal struggle.</p>\n<p>I arrived at my seat sweaty and sore, greeted by the familiar white-haired ushers and Bowl workers, who are always so kind. I had missed the opener, Perfume Genius, but a father and son sitting behind me were more than happy to share their thoughts.

I could tell by the simple but equally elaborate stage setup that the visuals were going to be amazing. My impatience grew, so I went to withdraw cash to purchase a churro after seeing other people munching on theirs.</p>\n<p>The xx began their set, of course, with “Intro,” from their debut LP. Nostalgia rushed over me as I witnessed them perform the song that had initially brought them to my attention after hearing it on the movie “Project X.” The talented guitarist and vocalist, Romy Madley Croft, began the intro riff to “Crystalised,” and the crowd immediately responded with cheers of joy. Similar to their music style, all three members were clad in dark, simple and aesthetic sweaters, leather jackets and jeans.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Producer and DJ Jamie xx made his talent on the stage clear when they began to play “Say Something Loving’’ from their junior album. He jumped effortlessly from one side of his elevated platform to the other, playing the drums or setting up a beat for the song. Bouncing back and forth to the beats, Romy and third bandmate Oliver Sim showcased the more dance- like upbeat sound and personality of the new album; although it remains equally as minimalist as previous albums.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78970\" style=\"width: 1343px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78970\" data-attachment-id=\"78970\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78970\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When I was approached to cover The xx show, I had the idea it would be an enjoyable show, but what I experienced was far more than that. The xx truly grabbed and held onto the energy and enthusiasm of the crowd the whole time. The visuals transformed from monochrome to colorful displays, seemingly matching the tone of the songs playing and creating a cinematic experience throughout the Bowl. The guitar riffs, groovy bass and dream-like beats created an unforgettable atmosphere; the emotion and happiness of the crowd was at a level I had never witnessed before.</p>\n<p>The xx continued to entrance the crowd with songs off all three albums and their minimal stylistic visuals that provided an optical spectacle. Six mirror prisms rotated and lit up accordingly with the style of the song. At one point, Sim stepped off the stage, seemingly ending the show, only to reveal Jamie xx playing one of his solo songs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78969\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876541609\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78969\" data-attachment-id=\"78969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78969\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Between the encore of “On Hold” and “Angels,” the group took a minute to announce that a dollar of each ticket sale was going to Pacific Pride.

It had me thinking about the stories I will tell of seeing bands like The xx as an adolescent.

One of these discoveries was Father John Misty — then fresh off of the release of his sophomore album, <em>I Love You, Honeybear</em>. I wish that I remembered how I found his music or which application suggested it to me. I would thank that person — or thank that thing — for giving me music that always reminds me of the last days of summer: slightly melancholy, tinged with end of season ennui, evoking a feeling that doesn’t quite have a name. In one of the first concerts of the fall cycle, the enigmatic singer-songwriter will be making his Santa Barbara debut on Oct. 11 at the Arlington Theatre.</p>\n<p>Father John Misty, also known as Josh Tillman, began his tenure in the indie world as drummer for folk revivalists Fleet Foxes. His time in the band was relatively short — but not very sweet. Tillman’s face in recordings of the band’s shows often times looks annoyed and even exasperated; it is quite clear that he grew bored with the band’s sound. He and band leader Robin Pecknold did not end on the best of terms; when asked about his ex-bandmate’s music, Pecknold has been known to not say much about it. Once Tillman left Fleet Foxes, he released a couple of tepid, quietly received records under the name J. Tillman. Then, something changed. During a trip on mushrooms, he saw a truer version of himself, and immediately decided to follow it. He adopted the moniker Father John Misty, moved to Los Angeles and immediately began writing songs for his 2012 debut, <em>Fear Fun</em>.</p>\n<p>After the release of <em>Fear Fun</em>, Father John Misty became an overnight indie icon. His sharp wit and unique turns of phrase resonated with critics and listeners alike — and everyone wanted more. Songs such as “Nancy from Now On” still sound fresh now, especially considering that he is as deft a musician as he is a songwriter. His warm vocals and smooth, rolling percussion arrangements are absolutely mesmerizing — even sultry at times. There’s a video on YouTube featuring him performing this track, shot live in the studio of KEXP, and it is probably one of my most watched performances of all time. In said video, Father John Misty, whom has been quite vocal about his experimentation with psychedelics, proudly wears a shirt that says, “FREEDOM NOW LEGALIZE LSD.” He has one hand on his hip, and the other one is holding a percussion shaker. When he opens his mouth to sing, every note is deliberate, and every lyric is clear. He is an artist, and he knows exactly what he is doing. Watching him perform is the kind of experience that makes a music lover realize what it is they adore about seeing a show.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the release of his latest album, <em>Pure Comedy</em>, Father John Misty took on a new role in the indie world. He has never been one to censor himself, but a shift in his focus is clear: He is looking outward more than he ever has before. The title track is a scathing commentary on the mores of modern life, from overconsumption to political discontent. The setlist of his fall tour is packed with lush singles from the beginning of his career and the dense ballads that mark this most recent phase in his career.

His latest project, <em>Flower Boy, </em>is a more mature offering that might signal a new style for the rapper and producer. On his new record, Tyler knows when he’s needed, and when to step back and let his production and guest singers take the spotlight. In the end, he strikes a perfect balance. While guest appearances by Kali Uchis, Rex Orange County and Frank Ocean stand out, they don’t overshadow the rapper/producer, as his vision and influence is still strongly felt throughout every track. From the silky smooth vocal performances on “See You Again,” to the hard-hitting rap-focused tracks like “I Ain’t Got Time!,” to songs that manage to integrate both seamlessly like “911 / Mr. Lonely,” this album has everything you want from a popular rap album in 2017.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OB12BslMI3Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Abysmal Thoughts</em></strong><strong>, The Drums</strong></p>\n<p>The lo-fi indie pop outfit returns with their fourth studio album, <em>Abysmal</em> <em>Thoughts</em>. After The Drums co-founder Jacob Graham left the group in 2014, frontman Jonathan Pierce found himself working alone under The Drums moniker. The result is a deeply personal album that explores Pierce’s insecurities and doubts, a record that lives up to the standards The Drums have set with their three previous albums. Singles “Blood Under My Belt” and “Heart Basel,” as well as the song “Rich Kids” stand out as some of the catchiest tracks of the summer. Overall, this album’s synth-centric, surfer rock-pop sound made it one of the standout summer soundtracks and is definitely worth a listen if you missed it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJ7QPuvv91JuvcguSdXZCvJz5UnF5Va4j&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em></strong><strong>, Open Mike Eagle</strong></p>\n<p>Released just a few weeks ago on Sept. 25, <em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em> is the biggest outlier among our list. Don’t expect Open Mike Eagle’s trademark humor to come through very strong on this one. There is no appearance from frequent collaborator and stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress or a song about hosting a fake late night show. Instead, the art-rapper explores subjects like gentrification, race and the normalization of the insanity of the modern day through personal experiences regarding his childhood home, the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. The end product is an introspective tour through Eagle’s memories and unique view on the world over relatively low-key but engaging beats. While it is understated, the songs are still catchy like the sweet nostalgia of Eagle’s remembered childhood on “95 Radios” and “(How Could Anybody) Feel At Home,” in which Mike’s flow impresses over a captivating DJ Nobody instrumental with haunting flute-like synths and quick percussion. If you’re a fan of Open Mike Eagle or like your rap music more personal than showy, this is the album for you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FCRoJaaN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Saturation </em></strong><strong>and <em>Saturation II</em>, BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p>The spiritual successors to Odd Future take the last two spots on our list, which we admit is sort of cheating, but the summer of 2017 was the summer of BROCKHAMPTON. Led by Kevin Abstract, the collective of over a dozen members, which began as a group of friends who met on a Kanye West fan forum, now lives up to their self-given moniker of “the Internet’s first boy band.” It’s not common for a group to release two albums of equally stellar quality back to back, but that’s the case with <em>Saturation</em> and <em>Saturation II. </em>Boasting six rappers that appear on nearly every song, each rapper of BROCKHAMPTON brings their own unique styling to each track, from Dom McLennon’s technical flow to Merlyn Wood’s manic, energetic personality, to Matt Champion’s undeniable swagger. It’s impossible not to root for these guys after watching their amateurish, handheld music videos and seeing how much fun they’re having. I haven’t even mentioned the excellent contributions from JOBA, Ameer Vann and Abstract or the extensive list of in-house producers and managers that make up the rest of the group. With the upcoming release of the group’s third album of the year, <em>Saturation III</em>, this group is just getting started. If you like bangers, Artsweek suggests “Heat,” “Gummy,” “Gold,” “Star” and “Junky” … and maybe “Swamp,” too. But actually, just listen to all of it.

It is an influential, forward-moving scene and a genre that has seeped into countless others. Many Top 40 hits of the past decade wouldn’t have existed without the influence of electronic music. And yes, the Isla Vista music scene as we know it today wouldn’t exist without it, either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is difficult to trace the genesis of an entire music scene in any community, especially when you consider something as vague as the  “electronic” label. There isn’t any particular strain of electronica that is unique to Isla Vista — walking down the street on a Friday night, you’ll encounter dubstep, house and all of the other niche sounds in between. These sounds are integral to our infamous party scene, and they provide the soundtrack for many weekend experiences, from the smallest house parties to the most ridiculous fraternity ragers. Despite this, however, most of the live music that one can experience in I.V. is confined to the realm of guitar music. There is not much by the way of live deejay sets, which is actually surprising considering the diverse community of musicians residing in Isla Vista. But at one time, electronica was dominating the live I.V. music scene. In fact, one of our most famous alumni is Steve Aoki, world-famous musician, deejay and record producer, and the roots of Aoki’s chart-topping career can be traced back to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1996, the then-college student started throwing shows in his two story apartment located on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, later known affectionately as the Pickle Patch. This infamous, residential music venue and part-time living room was home to a plethora of live shows featuring artists like Jimmy Eat World and At the Drive In.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Aoki was merely 19, he was throwing roughly 20 shows a month out of his living room, recording tapes of every single one.

During that period of time, the genre wasn’t a mainstay in music, and it was barely putting down roots in underground scenes. The long-haired music mastermind was a punk aficionado back in those days, organizing shows at the popular housing co-op Biko. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biko, located on the 66 Block of Sueno, is known for its role in campus activism and strengthening diversity in the I.V. network of housing co-ops. Aoki was a student of color at UCSB when the concept of diversity was way more of a question and concern than it is now. However, a student of color organizing hardcore rock shows would be something slightly out of the ordinary even in the present. Although it is not clear whether his focus on electronic music endeavors heightened before or after UCSB, his influence on the Isla Vista rock scene is undeniable, and the world-famous DJ still maintains a punk rock performance ethic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you attend a Steve Aoki show, you are there expecting at least one thing: cake. His performances have become infamous because of his habit of throwing full, frosted sheet cakes into the audience. This carefree, slightly reckless approach to performing is something that can still be found in the ethos of Isla Vista backyard show culture. There is still a clear emphasis on letting go, getting pushed to the front of the crowd and getting a little messy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, Aoki returned to Isla Vista for a show in the Hub, organized by A.S. Program Board. It was free of charge and sold out very quickly as word moved across campus that one of our own would be returning to grace the stage. He said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “My expectations are all over the place, I didn’t realize that it was going to sell out. It’s cool to hear that, of course.” Indeed it was, no matter how nonchalantly the then-almost superstar tried to play it off. It is important to note that this was a year when electronic music in the mainstream was taking off in a major way, signaling a turn of the decade trend. Electronic music influences began to creep their way ever so subtly into pop, alternative and hip-hop, and it barely created a fuss. Now electronic music is not merely a trend, but a phenomenon across the country, including in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the live music scene privileges guitar music over basically everything else, there is a strong love for electronica that flows through the veins of Isla Vista. Almost any significant party or event is bound to feature tracks with a bass drop, which is welcomed, loved, and expected. Aoki is one of many Isla Vista musicians who has gone on to do things beyond the single square mile radius of our beloved town, but he is one of the few that had an unmistakable mark on its culture.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Currently, the rapper/business mogul is established as one of hip hop’s most prominent and influential figures, even being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame last month. In the wake of his induction, Jay-Z announced the release date of his 13th studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which dropped on June 30. The release of this particular record is an interesting creative pivot for Jay-Z. Peering into the methodological, meticulous disposition of the record highlights the direction in which contemporary music presentation could be headed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay-Z illustrates the application of a business mind in music industry. He secured the No. 2 spot on the latest </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annual “Forbes Five” list of the richest figures in hip hop with an estimated net worth of $810 million. Last year, Sprint invested $200 million in his music streaming service, Tidal, which put the company’s worth at six times what he initially paid for it. Across the breadth of his career, the artist has demonstrated a fiscally successful approach to nearly everything he touches. This success, in conjunction with his musical catalog, is largely the reason why the artist is so influential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the lens of the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one can observe a distinct change of style in the rapper’s product packaging. The album’s rollout wasn’t long or elaborate, contrary to many of his contemporaries’ releases (Kanye West, Drake, etc.), and its role on Tidal is quite peculiar. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tidal, Jay-Z released a collection of “short films” with the album, some of which are videos for particular tracks, while others are footnotes for those music videos which essentially contextualize their content. These films are somewhat abstract; interrupting the music in the video of “4:44” are obscure viral videos and clips that appear to be from Worldstar Hip Hop. An interpretive dance can be seen at the end of the video, perhaps depicting his and Beyonce’s relationship. In the footnotes of “The Story of OJ” and “4:44,” prominent media figures like Will Smith and Kendrick Lamar express their thoughts on race and their attitudes towards women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation and packaging of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is relatively new to the rap scene. Jay-Z takes an unorthodox approach, making it an absolute pain in the ass for you to listen to his music. In order to even stream the album, you must either a) subscribe to Tidal, as his discography has been removed from all other platforms, or b) navigate a labyrinth of online tutorials that lead to free, temporary access to the streaming service. To clarify: this pain isn’t necessarily a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of these short films and additional elements of the album (e.g., Jay-Z’s daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, laying a verse on physical copies of the album), Jay-Z provides an interactive, intimate perspective into his own life. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far more personal than the bulk of his past work, opening up about his infidelity and thoughts on racial inequality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Kanye West, a semi-estranged affiliate of Jay-Z’s and a business enigma in himself. The release of his last record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Life of Pablo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was one of the strangest musical occurrences of 2016. The album title erratically shifted multiple times. Analogously, the content of the album itself wasn’t static either, something completely antithetical to the nature of commercial music. That is, West released multiple updated versions of the album, framing it as a “living, evolving art project.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can additionally look to artists like Frank Ocean, who also exhibited one of the oddest album rollouts of the year. After enduring a tumultuous relationship with Def Jam Recordings and releasing the visual album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to satisfy contractual agreements with the label, Ocean released his album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a four year manifestation of the artist’s creative endeavors. Moreover, the record didn’t just come to fruition in an exclusively sonic form. Like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which paired an album with minimalistic visual production, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was accompanied with an $80 visual compilation of mixed media: a magazine entitled “Boys Don’t Cry,” the name of his current personal music label. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artists like West and Ocean have illustrated something that Jay-Z is doing right now, something that has become increasingly popular among artists, particularly rap artists today. That is, these creators are moving beyond status quo and crafting interactive, elaborate works of art that deviate from conventional boundaries of music. Artists are becoming more creative with the way in which they promote and present their music. This isn’t something that was nonexistent prior to the work of contemporary rap artists, but rap is one of the most rapidly expanding genres of music. Its popularity has sprawled beyond the confines of its initial conception. Today’s hip-hop leaders are presented with the opportunity to redefine what we see as an album experience, shaping it in a more creative, interactive direction.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

One year later, his giant bat-thing minions are romping around, eating babies, killing peasants and just generally having a grand ol’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Trevor Belmont (Armitage), the whip-wielding vampire hunter with amusingly triangular beard hair and a laughably neat scar over his left eye that often looks purple in the right lighting. Besides being a disappointingly standard reluctant hero, Belmont also serves as the primary exposition machine, almost constantly spouting information about his family in order to explain his character motivations. Because screw nuance and mystery, let’s just tell everyone outright who the hell this guy is and why he’s doing stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not even an interesting enough story here to utilize Belmont to any interesting degree. In fact, it’s just as standard and cookie-cutter as he is: a hero who doesn’t care about anyone ends up in town. He meets people. He gives a shit. He defends the town. End. Yay! Although perhaps the show can be given credit to adhering more to Western clichés than fantasy ones.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78589\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1267486673\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78588\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78589\" data-attachment-id=\"78589\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=1308%2C578&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1308,578\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=888%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78589 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1-1024x453.png?resize=888%2C393\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C453&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could have potentially remedied this uninspired tale was if any of the secondary characters were able to compensate for Belmont’s dull characterization. Alas, no. Belmont does not interact with very many people and when he does, it’s often just to provide more exposition. His exchange with a villainous bishop (Matt Frewer, who seems to be taking a lot of influence from Tony Jay’s performance in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”) wrangles little tension, the paramount moment of said conversation amounting the bishop to basically just telling Belmont, “Go away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the best part of the show is its ending, and no, not because it’s over. Belmont and the mage Sypha (Alejandra Reynoso) come across a fan-favorite character and fight him in the season’s final boss battle (after only four episodes, unfortunately). The fight between Belmont and said character is enjoyably frenetic, demonstrating their superhuman abilities to their full degrees and revealing the nature of their characters. It’s a much more satisfying conclusion than a prior battle that the entire season was building up to, which comes and goes with an “eh.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Story aside, what may have been the second-biggest draw for some people was the show being animated. Oftentimes, animation can be the superior medium to deliver a fantasy story, as it forgoes having to build extravagant sets and blow a fortune on CGI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here though, the animation is about on par with your average modern anime. People and creatures are all drawn, whereas the backgrounds are all obviously computer generated. But with the characters being consistently on-model and some killer lighting (evoking fellow vampire series “Hellsing Ultimate” at points), it gets the job done, even if every so often, there are a couple small mishaps involving mechanical lips and wonky arms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering it’s tantalizingly short length, “Castlevania” is better off being binged as a film, maybe on a boring summer day, because this is not Netflix’s big new hit by any means. It’s fun at times, but it does not exceed in any particular area to be considered anything other than a light snack. The series itself is also, I think, too old for our age group to cull any personal investment in seeing the famous game series be adapted to television.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung likes the movie “Super Marios Bros.,” so take his opinion with a grain of salt. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78588\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78588\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/","id":5785,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5784,5783,5782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Wonder Woman’ Carries the DC Universe Forward","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges towa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Wonder Woman” has finally arrived with the weight of DC’s future resting upon her shoulders. But has director Patty Jenkins been able to finally break the chain of critical flops, from that of “Batman v Superman” to that of “Suicide Squad?” Have our beloved childhood comic-book heroes finally been released from the poisonous grip of Zack Snyder? Well, it’s a bit difficult to say. For the most part the answer is yes; “Wonder Woman” is far from being a letdown. The film, which is at times incredible and at other times questionable, is more of a successful bunt than it is a home-run, with the folks at DC taking a very cautious and careful step forward toward critical redemption. The result is a well-executed yet formulaic film that abides by the many tired conventions of the comic book form, leaving little room for innovation and frustrating anyone looking for a fresh new take on the comic book genre. Still, for anyone looking for a fun, fast-paced action-adventure blockbuster, then this is exactly what you’ve been looking for. But for those of us who wish for something more from their comic-book films, you’ll be left wanting just a little bit more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1645836084\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78366\"><img data-attachment-id=\"78367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=936%2C334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"936,334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=888%2C317&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=888%2C317\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=768%2C274&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The good news is that there are plenty of aspects to enjoy about the film. Each and every location and act, save the final CGI airfield mess, is incredibly entertaining, at least on a surface level. From the beautiful Amazonian home of Themyscira, which showcases some of the film’s more outlandish and entertaining sequences (when will you ever again get to watch Amazon warriors face off against villainous Germans?) to the solemn war-torn fields of the Eastern Front, the film has its fair share of exotic locales and engrossing scenarios.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The issue here is the film’s jittery pace, as it never wants to stand still and take a breather. Halfway through the movie you’ll feel like you’ve tasted 20 different flavors of drastically different films, but you’re never allowed to stay and watch any one of them long enough to be satisfied. Between action sequences that mirror the adventures of Indiana Jones and the London alleyways that echo political spy thrillers, the film can never seem to decide on which movie it wants to be. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because each small snippet of genre, from fantasy to war, is relatively well-done. But having less than five minutes of screen time designated to the trenches of World War I can leave some with an unquenched thirst. Regardless, between its various moments of exhilaration, the film does a more than satisfactory job of keeping your attention focused, even if it all just feels like it’s skimming the surface of something that could have been even more worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The best scenes of the film are those that take the time to slow down, and these scenes are mostly shared between Gal Gadot (Diana aka Wonder Woman) and Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) as they confront the moral complexities of war. The contrasting of Trevor’s first-hand understanding of the horrors of war with Diana’s naïve black-and-white morality brings out the much deeper themes that the film desperately needs. Pine’s monologues on the nature of war are especially moving. One of the best sequences I’ve ever seen in a comic-book film has the two leads dancing in a war-torn village as snow begins to fall. Diana asks Trevor what people do when there isn’t any war to fight. He responds that they eat breakfast, read the paper, get married and do other mundane things typical of a peaceful time. When she asks him what it’s like to do such things, he wearily responds, “I have no idea.” The war runs deep in these scenes and shapes our leads into better characters. It’s a shame that the film barely addresses these issues, as these dramatic and heart-breaking moments bring out the best in Gadot’s performance and showcases the best the film has to offer. Moments like these are lovingly crafted by Jenkins.</p>\n<p>With a rather large and diverse cast, “Wonder Woman” establishes many great characters, although they’re accompanied by a few unfortunate duds. The standout here is clearly Pine’s character of Steve Trevor. Pine is funny, charming, courageous and downright inspirational (and as my girlfriend pointed out, downright cute). I wouldn’t be surprised if Pine used this performance as his audition tape for the next Indiana Jones. The subtleness in his acting, alongside his ability to make even the most ridiculous of scenes seem plausible, allows Pine to ultimately steal the spotlight. While his role in the film is structurally set up to support the overall progression of Gadot’s character and narrative, the film is arguably just as much Trevor’s story as it is Wonder Woman’s, which may be a problem for some.</p>\n<p>Gadot’s Wonder Woman is the hardest character to evaluate. While she performs feats of incredible strength and frequently takes control of her own decisions, charging into battle to save the lives of those in need, the character is equally as often presented as a naïve and almost “ditsy” character. While this “fish-out-of-water” personality fits within the narrative and is quite charming to watch, it makes it hard to distinguish Gadot’s acting ability from the youthful naivety of her character. Paired with her accent, some lines come out as just sounding off.</p>\n<p>But for the most part, Gadot can hold more than her own. She’s brave, sweet and can even pull out a surprising dramatic flair in some of her more emotional scenes. Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges toward the trenches of war has lost a part of their childhood <em>wonder</em>. It goes without saying that Gadot is a new inspirational action hero, not just for a female audience but for the general public as well.</p>\n<p>The supporting cast varies in talent. Robin Wright, who plays Wonder Woman’s mentor, Antiope, is absolutely amazing. Her stern kindness and sly grin, flashing in the face of battle, make the short time spent with her character immensely enjoyable. David Thewlis is also as calming and talented as ever, even though his character sputters out in the last act. Eugene Brave Rock as the Chief, however, is shockingly terrible. There haven’t been too many performances that I have audibly laughed at before, and I can only suggest that aspiring actors use his performance as a case study for how not to act in a film. The villains, Danny</p>\n<p>Huston’s Ludendorff and Elena Anaya’s Dr. Maru, are disappointingly misused in the film. Ludendorff, while convincingly acted, is just another addition to the throwaway comic-book movie villain fodder, and together with Dr. Maru, the two act more like the laughable villains of a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. It’s a shame, too, because Anaya’s Dr. Maru is absolutely chilling in her few brief appearances and could have made a memorable female supervillain if she hadn’t been ultimately cast aside for an unnecessary CGI slugfest.</p>\n<p>“Wonder Woman” is far from a bad film. There are barely any major issues outside of a forced third act and an annoying absence of development and quiet time for our characters. But an absence of glaring issues does not mean that the film is great, or even very good. The film at its best is a fun popcorn flick. Beyond its period setting, “Wonder Woman” isn’t very different from your run-of-the-mill comic book fare. The grouping up of our heroes to face off against an undeveloped super-baddie is just so overdone at this point that the outcome is exhausting. There’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before.</p>\n<p>In a sense, “Wonder Woman” has saved the DCEU for Warner Brothers, <em>with</em> its glowing praise and an enormous opening. But at what cost? The company’s answer to the scathing reviews and steep revenue drop-offs of its former DC films is in the form of a relatively safe and formulaic picture. While the film may surpass the quality of its predecessors and even overcome a few of the Marvel features, it nevertheless cripples itself to the expectations set by the typical comic book venture, forcing “Wonder Woman” to shy away from its more engrossing and deeper themes. Nearly a decade after Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” critics and audiences seem to have greatly lowered their expectations for what a comic book film could be. Even though “Wonder Woman” is far from being a bad film, passing up plenty of its comic contemporaries, we shouldn’t have to lower our standards for our childhood superheroes due to the genre’s often mediocre result. While “Wonder Woman” isn’t mediocre, it still isn’t great and holds on as tight as it possibly can to the prospect of being good. Still, the film is a step in the right direction, albeit a very cautious one.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, “Wonder Woman” is still incredibly enjoyable to watch and is probably the best movie out right now. You can’t help but smile when her incredibly energetic theme song fills the theater.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most cynical of us will always wonder to ourselves what could have been.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78366\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78366\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/","id":5786,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5785,5784,5783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"WebsterX and Milwaukee’s Hip Hop Renaissance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=937%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Injury Reserve and WebsterX share a dynamic of creating spaces to craft seamlessly gravitative rap songs that are entirely divergent from their contemporaries.

Incorporating introspective subject matter into refined and precise production exemplifies the masterful work on the album as well as the artist’s previous project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The enticing tempos that sway from the melodic “Underground” to the hard-hitting “Heaven’s Gates” constantly keep the listener enthralled, rather than merely falling victim to the problem that many of his contemporaries face of utilizing the same generic FL studios bass-heavy beat. WebsterX’s thought-provoking lyricism derives from a genuinely honest perspective, so it resonates vividly with his listeners. He is a symbol of originality in the rap world, as his diverse take on production and poignant content converge to form utter uniqueness.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is titled as such for two reasons, one being the visual reason. I like how the word looks and sounds. My friend Kenny captioned a photo ‘Daymares’ and posted it. I saw the word and immediately gravitated towards it and knew right then and there it’d be the title of my debut project,” he explained. “The second reason being the meaning behind it. Daymares are nightmares that are happening during the day, and the album touches on the first and only real big dark period I went through in my life, in years 2014-2015, in that 2013-2017 period of my career thus far. I couldn’t function much during the day because I was plagued by my first experience with depression, anxiety, self-doubt and simple growing pains, worrying about dropping out of school to pursue music and having to tell my parents that, because music was going crazy for me locally. Worrying about the large local reception of my debut mixtape </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and how to follow up, all that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2014 single “Doomsday” has garnered north of one million streams on Spotify and induced the buzz that established WebsterX as a significant presence in the minds of many music fans and critics. The artist’s delivery on the track is innovative and captivating. Ominously enchanting cadences float above the track’s instrumentation and blend with the artist’s light falsetto, confirming the track as an enthralling hit, despite its dark lyricism. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebsterX explained, “‘Doomsday’ was written during that dark period of mine, originally intended to be the first single for the first version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I made and eventually scrapped; it blew up pretty much from the blogs. The video that I made with my videographers Damien Blue and Cody LaPlant also set the song ablaze; they do all my videos and absolutely go crazy. The song sits over a million now on Spotify and is the reason for kickstarting my career into national attention.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creative process for WebsterX emanates from writing in a peaceful state of mind while concurrently reflecting on any hardship he previously encountered. WebsterX said, “ I can only write from a happy, driven and calm perspective. So during the depressed and anxious-ridden points, I never wrote. Once I overcame that period I reflected and wrote about it all from a clearer perspective, which made </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the last question I mentioned I scrapped a first version of the project; that would be because I tried writing it from a dark mindset, and to me it was just too dark and slow. The version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is out today is more of a life album because lyrically it’s not all about that dark period in time.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78439\" style=\"width: 587px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054044219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78439\" data-attachment-id=\"78439\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-43/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=792%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78439\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-577x1024.jpg?resize=577%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?w=792&amp;ssl=1 792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of writing in this clear mindset, rather than one submerged in calamity, ultimately made a project that depicts a narrative of a young man experiencing the trials and tribulations of adult life, specifically addressing the tangible effects of sadness on one’s mental state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of WebsterX’s parents are Ethiopian immigrants, making him a first-generation American, but he is not the first in his family to pursue a career in music. About how his roots in Ethiopian culture impacted his creativity, he said, “Ethiopia is a one-of-a-kind place in Africa and around the world. It’s looked at as a mecca to some Rastafarians, the cradle and start of humanity to the science world and a place full of beautiful people, music and culture to me. My parents are both Ethiopian; my father was a professional club soccer player and famous musician in the country and my mother’s side of the family is a coffee business of royalty. My father without knowing it instilled kindness, wiseness, love and creativity into me. My mother brought toughness, empathy for people and directness to me. With that I feel I balance both very well, and my older sister put me onto all the cool stuff I know today at a very early age.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi reflected on melancholic realities with progressive instrumentation and cathartic flow that pushed musical boundaries, thus making him one of the top influential rappers for younger generations. The Milwaukee rapper WebsterX cited Kid Cudi as one of his major influences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi emerged at a time when people who were born between 1990-1997 were experiencing middle school and high school,” he said. “For a rapper to come out with this lonely stoner, cosmic tone to his music and a melodic delivery along with good-feel raps, he simply had the relatable factor on his side.” He continued, “Being associated with Kanye was also crucial because Kanye was running our generation’s iPods at the time and pretty much still does. Cudi’s music was also very chorus-driven; [which was] a big and addictive reason why I think they resonated with a lot of people, including me. From his style to the music, he felt like one of us even though he was 24 at the time that this was all happening for him.” Similarly, WebsterX has crafted his own unconventional style, yet he remains an impactful voice that is simultaneously emphatic and relatable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, WebsterX joined his friends from Injury Reserve to perform a couple of live shows around the SoCal area. “IR are the super homies,” he said. “Those dudes [and] their team are incredibly talented and everyone who is fortunate enough to realize that, realizes it. They didn’t teach me anything necessarily, but what was happening was more of a realization of who they are as people and why their music sounds the way it does. Both camps got closer and still retain that relationship to this day. To me, they’re one of the most refreshing, straightforward, exciting groups out today. Both of our shows in Cali were major, especially the LA show, sheesh.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injury Reserve and WebsterX share a dynamic of creating spaces to craft seamlessly gravitative rap songs that are entirely divergent from their contemporaries. They are the embodiments of unapologetically challenging what rap </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sound like, as they offer sonically experimental tracks with progressive lyrics that open up thoughtful conversation about themes that are relatively taboo in the rap realm, such as depression and insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A rapper and his hometown go hand-in-hand like a symbiotic pair; take Chance the Rapper and Chicago, Jay Z and New York, Kendrick Lamar and Compton for example. WebsterX hails from the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city that is stereotypically known more for its cheese than for being a forerunner in producing rap artists. WebsterX explained his deeply rooted origins in the city of Milwaukee and the distinct passion he holds for the location, citing a plethora of exemplary and incredible artists to come out of the Milwaukee community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Milwaukee is a full-blown city, fifth largest in the midwest,” he said. “Briefly, Milwaukee can be described by its four locations: North, West, East and Southside. Northside is predominantly black. Southside is predominately Latino. Eastside is the coming-of-age college town, yuppy central and affordable hip neighborhood. Riverwest is where all the music is popping mostly out of the city across all genres and downtown Milwaukee is on the Eastside mostly. The Westside is sort of jokingly no man’s land, a mixture of north and west. If you were coming from out of town, mostly everyone would recommend the Eastside of Milwaukee to you for artistic spaces, live music, sporting events, pretty much everything entertainment wise. The Eastside brews and takes in the majority of the indie pop/rock, folk, metal, hip hop, rap, etc. acts in the city. We have our fair share of bigger acts coming out of Milwaukee as a whole such as IshDARR (Northside), myself (Eastside), Vinyl Theatre, who is on tour with Twenty One Pilots right now (Eastside), Field Report, a slight extension of Bon Iver (Eastside) [and] Grace Weber (Eastside) who was on Chance’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coloring Book, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as well as the very talented acts and personal favorites of mine who are really on the come up: Zed Kenzo, Taj Raiden, Platinum Boys, Soul Low, Milo, Foreign Goods, Boodah DARR, Kane and my collective New Age Narcissism consisting of Siren, Lex Allen, Lorde Freddee and Q the Sun. If you ask me about Milwaukee I’m gonna need a few paragraphs; I know too much.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78440\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1389042588\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78440\" data-attachment-id=\"78440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-1-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=937%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"937,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78440\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1-682x1024.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=937&amp;ssl=1 937w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked WebsterX about the difficulties that accompany a music career founded in such a city as Milwaukee. “The only thing that’s difficult is there are no real resources here,” he said. “You really gotta do it yourself or with friends. There’s lack of management, no booking agents, not many all-age venues and more. However, due to the recent successes of a lot of emerging acts, Milwaukee as a whole, musically, is being looked at more from the outside, and radio stations, venues [and] publications are aiding the local scene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rapper’s insight highlights something that is distinct in a multitude of artists from the area: an independent, DIY approach to creative expression. This element of creativity is something that has further expedited Milwaukee down the path of musical recognition and imbued the city with a distinct character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his own work, WebsterX harbors a refined and intriguing taste in art. Highlighting some of his current choices in music and film, the artist stated, “Musically I’m into </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Frank Ocean, Injury Reserve’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Floss </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, Playboi Carti’s tape, Syd’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sampha’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAMN. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Kendrick Lamar, but then again that changes each day. I always tell people to pay attention to my Soundcloud ‘likes,’ too, to see what I’m listening to. My taste in film really boils down to indie films, horror, coming-of-age films, documentaries and the occasional chick flick. My favorite films are the ones that are shot well, look ahead of their time visually or think ahead of their time.

This week, Rita Silverman discusses the importance of Sherman Alexie’s <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> in today’s events while Addy Stupin takes on the surreal dystopia of Haruki Murakami’s <em>1Q84</em>. Submissions are solicited and edited by Phi Do.</p>\n<h2><strong>Rita Silverman on Sherman Alexie’s <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i></strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have entered an era of protests. We hold up signs in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and walk alongside the Women’s March to advocate for equal rights. Under our new president, I wonder if these protests can realistically yield anything. As an alternative, we turn to music, art and, specifically, literature to give us answers, hope and a little bit of comedic relief. Sherman Alexie has accomplished just that in his novel, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which gives a voice to the largely forgotten original people of America: Native Americans. It follows Junior, a 14-year-old Native American boy who lives in an Indian reservation where a cultural genocide is happening. He goes through life thinking the only people who </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deserve</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a good life and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a good life are white people. It then occurs to Junior that he must venture outside of the reservation by attending an all-white high school to prove that white people are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the only people who deserve a good life. Aside from racial injustices, the novel also focuses on a young boy trying to figure out his life with girls, bullies, friends and family — things we can all relate to. Moreover, the narration is a first-person voice from a pre-pubescent perspective, making it outrageously hilarious, unimaginably raw and honest. It was absolutely necessary to relieve all the anger and stress from current events. Alexie’s simple and witty writing allows us, as the audience, to realize that there is a racial injustice against Native Americans right in front of our eyes and we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do something about it, starting with by addressing and acknowledging the injustice.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Addy Stupin on Haruki Murakami’s <i>1Q84</i></strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, written by renowned Japanese author Haruki Murakami and translated into English by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel is, in a word, bizarre. It reads like a fever dream. Taking place in Japan in 1984 and switching between three points of view, a complex story is woven. The narrators of the novel include a dodgy but skilled private investigator, a cram school teacher who is also an aspiring writer and a fitness instructor with an unusual side job, all of whom share a past. At the heart of everything are the young teacher, Tengo, and the instructor, Aomame. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The novel itself follows the repercussions of an unusual book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air Chrysalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the brainchild of a beautiful young schoolgirl and ghostwritten by the aforementioned cram school teacher. The presence of two moons in the sky, a feature of the world imaged in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air Chrysalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hints at a bizarre alternative universe, which is coined “1Q84.” In this slightly-off universe, of which only a certain few are seemingly aware, a powerful cult works to eliminate those who have become aware of this new reality, namely Tengo and Aomame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although an abstract connection, a parallel from George Orwell’s famed dystopia, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can be drawn. 1Q84 exists as a separate entity outside of 1984 — a different version of that same year. Often, when society faces difficult times, writers react by fictionalizing darker worlds. Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an example of this technique. His creation of a society dictated by the all-encompassing “Big Brother,” was a response to the rising nationalism and competing ideologies leading to World War II. Murakami borrows directly from Orwell in terms of his title, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and also through the alternate interpretation of his novel and the greater message to be found if one reads in between the lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While undeniably well written, the intricate and sometimes confusing narrative makes one wonder if the story is so surreal and well done that it is beyond comprehension or a bit clumsily composed at times. This book is a true page-turner and, although open-ended occurrences may be off-putting, the exceedingly well crafted work and interesting characters are undeniable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, sales of Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have spiked with the current American political state cited as the reason. Through the fantastical novel’s connections with Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, parallels can also be drawn to present day America, the flawed leadership and turmoil comparable, to some, to a sort of alternative universe. A character in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a controversial cult leader with an avid following and unhealthy amount of control, perhaps finds similarities, albeit abstract, in Big Brother’s control and replication of not entirely truthful facts.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is part mystery, part romance, part commentary and entirely a successful dystopia.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-02/its-lit-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-02/its-lit-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-02/its-lit-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-02/its-lit-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-02/its-lit-2/","id":6957,"author":{"id":657,"name":"Rita Silverman"},"related":[6956,6955,6954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: After Laughter by Paramore","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/52352910.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/52352910.jpeg?resize=520%2C520&ssl=1","description":"After Laughter paints Paramore as a magnetic band that creates charismatic pop anthems while still preserving and maturing their emo-inclined expression.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paramore we associated with high-fashion Hot Topic T-shirts and the critically acclaimed movie, “Twilight,” has since reinvented their sound into a mature, whizzing pop punch on their fifth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Laughter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

After a couple listens to the track, one can look past the brightly lit euphoria and unwind the dark subject matter of Williams’s metaphorical representations of depression, comparing it to “a hole in the ground.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second track, “Rose-Colored Boy,” is undeniably the most pop-influenced track, but Williams brings about a somber and intimate narrative, comparing her emotional emptiness to that seemingly optimistic attitude of a guy who typifies her as a “lost cause.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The catchiness of the album only exceeds expectations after the two first songs, ending in nostalgia as the final two tracks of the album, “No Friend” and “Tell Me How,” act as odes to the sound of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand New Eyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Paramore era. Within the heart of the album lies a three-minute acoustic- and synth-heavy track titled “Fake Happy,” which exceptionally documents the insincerity of human emotions.

Hell no.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday, May 25, Pollock Theater’s Trans Media series program screened “Tangerine,” the movie most widely known for being shot on an iPhone 5S. It’s Christmas Eve, and Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) has just been released from prison only to find out that her boyfriend, Chester (James Ransone), left her for another girl. To find out the truth about this rumor, Sin-Dee and her friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) journey through the diverse areas of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The film feels very authentic with the way in which it captures Los Angeles. The use of the iPhone 5S helps show the setting in a more down-to-earth manner. Everything appears as if it were captured in the moment, instead of being modified to look more perfect in post-production. The unrestricted nature of using a smartphone instead of a large camera benefitted the production of this film, as there were shots that would not be done in a traditional filmmaking set because sound or lighting equipment would interfere with the reflection or flow of a shot.</p>\n<p>The acting is another factor of the film that made it such a realistic experience. Most of the people involved in the film were not big names, but the possibility that they actually live in Los Angeles made their performances feel more genuine than if it were to be done by any Hollywood actor. Most of the supporting cast are the various people Sin-Dee and Alexandra meet during their odyssey across Los Angeles. They all play some part in reflecting the general themes of friendship and connectedness in the film. The performances don’t even feel like actors reading lines; they feel like normal people causally living their lives which are captured by director Sean Baker’s crew.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While Rodriguez was excellent in her role as Sin-Dee, Taylor stole every scene she was in as Alexandra, which is what made me highly anticipate the Q&amp;A session that was held after the screening between Taylor and Patrice Petro, director of Carsey-Wolf Center and Film and Media Studies Department professor.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained how she got the role through Baker, who approached her while she was talking with a friend outside the Los Angeles LGBT Center because he wanted to draw real-life experiences for the film. Taylor was the only one helping him, and he liked her personality, believing that she fit the character of Alexandra best. In actuality, Taylor, a trans woman, was very insecure during the time she was in production for “Tangerine” because she had just transitioned.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78260\" style=\"width: 1285px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"590552921\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78259\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78260\" data-attachment-id=\"78260\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/tangerine/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=1275%2C742&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1275,742\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tangerine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=888%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78260\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=888%2C517\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?w=1275&amp;ssl=1 1275w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=1024%2C596&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Film Society of Lincoln Center</p></div>\n<p>She explained to Petro that she wanted to take her personal life completely away from her when becoming Alexandra. The character was confident, so Taylor used the experience she had in “Tangerine” to make herself as confident as the character she was portraying.</p>\n<p>This confidence that Taylor gained remained with her even after the release of the movie. Ever since, Taylor has become a vocal activist for the LGBT community. The purpose of UCSB’s Trans Media program is to “showcase contemporary media work in television, narrative filmmaking, and critical documentary in an effort to explore the relationship between sexual orientation and gender identity outside of a rigid binary view of the world,” according to the Carsey-Wolf Center website.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained to Petro that she felt like an advocate for trans women. Taylor illustrated this notion by recounting her personal life. She was rejected by jobs because her I.D. stated that she was still a man even though she considered herself  transgender. She explained how random strangers she met were much more accepting than her own family members. She wanted to live a normal life, and even though “Tangerine” gave her that opportunity, she still thought of those who didn’t have the same chance as she did. She explained how some people could get rejected so many times that they could resort to drugs; it was all a domino effect. She didn’t want to be selfish about her success and wanted to help others instead. With the money involved in her job, she noticed how she was moving up the ranks, and she looked to the people still on the streets. She noted how it was difficult to get out of this kind of situation, so she wanted to open up to that community more.</p>\n<p>However, even as an actress, she still faced being stereotyped by Hollywood. When Taylor was first doing auditions, her manager offered roles of a victim. These roles were associated with Taylor either playing a prostitute or someone who was killed in the film. As she went to more colleges and found more LGBT students, she realized that an entire community of people were viewed in one restricted way. Fortunately, Taylor began to work under a new manager, who got her into roles for the short films “Diane from the Moon” and “Happy Birthday, Marsha!”</p>\n<p>So, should “Tangerine” be only recognized for shooting on an iPhone 5S? Hell no. While the film itself was completely different from other films I have seen, it was the context surrounding this movie explained through Taylor’s Q&amp;A session that made the film feel much more unique and important.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/","id":5782,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5781,5780,5779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Dead Men’ Could Have Told A Better Tale Than This","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Dead Men Tell No Tales” thinks you are very, very stupid.

It has been painful seeing the decline of this once-proud (and actually fun) series, but at this point, it’s getting ridiculous.</p>\n<p>The film takes place 20-ish years after “At World’s End.” Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), son of Will Turner, is looking for the Trident of Poseidon in order to free Will from captainhood of the Flying Dutchman. The Trident, conveniently enough, has the power to break any curse. So Henry goes looking for Jack Sparrow in the hopes of recruiting his help and runs into the scientifically inclined Carina, whom he swears he is not in love with. Gee, I wonder whether or not they’ll end up together.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The greatest of this movie’s many sins is the fact that it’s first act is absolutely drowned in hackneyed exposition. The movie lets the principle of “show, don’t tell” walk the plank and proceeds to have every single one of its characters tell you outright who they are, what they want and what their skills are. “I’ve been studying all known curses for years,” Henry Turner tells his captain before committing mutiny 10 seconds later. No sooner is he thrown in the brig than a cellmate picks up a conveniently placed poster of Jack Sparrow and tells Henry that Sparrow has been buried in an unmarked grave. Thanks for the useless info that has zero bearing on the story, random stranger.</p>\n<p>This continual spoon-feeding of information never lets up for the rest of the movie. For instance, the not-at-all-intimidating, impossible to understand and interesting-as-dirt villain Captain Salazar narrates an extended flashback scene about how he was outwitted by Jack Sparrow. As it concludes with showing us when Salazar was cursed and imprisoned in the Devil’s Triangle, there is nary an explanation as to how or why, other than, “Oh, it’s called the Devil’s Triangle. So it’s cursed.”</p>\n<p>“Dead Men Tell No Tales” thinks you are very, very stupid. It believes you are not capable of deducing why characters might want to accomplish their goals. And when they are accomplishing those goals, the characters will go out and say, “We are accomplishing our goals!” just in case you didn’t already get it, you moron.</p>\n<p>Which, by the way, is exactly what Jack has been reduced to. All the cunning and guile he once had is replaced with a bumbling, drunken, abject idiocy and selfishness that makes him more annoying than likable. Jack has no goal in the movie, nothing to reach for. He is just getting dragged along for the ride, much as we are. The only time I felt any connection with him was when I shared his confusion when he woke up to discover that he was being married off to a horrendously disgusting woman that the movie wants you to know is horrendously disgusting so much because it doesn’t believe that you’ll figure out that Jack finds her horrendously disgusting. Where the hell did this scene come from and how exactly is it significant? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Barbossa receives the same treatment. A once-threatening villain has been thoroughly declawed, all for the sake of the movie delivering even more exposition to tell us that he had a past romance, which does not mesh well with the way he has acted in the past films. Salazar is unable to fill in the void that has been left behind, as he sounds too goofy and looks too artificial to have any menace. He falls far short when compared to the Barbossa of yore and the tragic Davy Jones. We are left with a villain who comes across as even more cartoony than the abundant CGI scenery.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78258\" style=\"width: 1279px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1826120927\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78257\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78258\" data-attachment-id=\"78258\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/dead-men-could-have-told-a-better-tale-than-this/pirates-of-the-caribbean/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=1269%2C887&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1269,887\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"pirates of the caribbean\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?fit=888%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78258\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=888%2C621\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?w=1269&amp;ssl=1 1269w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=768%2C537&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg?resize=1024%2C716&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78258\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Syko News</p></div>\n<p>While we are on the subject of mismanaged characters, Orlando Bloom is completely wasted as Will Turner. All he is there for is to serve as a bookend for the movie and a goal for Henry to strive for. Considering the excited whispers I heard during the Thursday night premiere, I have no qualms about calling him fan-service either (although he comes nowhere close to being so than another actress who will go unnamed for spoiler’s sake).</p>\n<p>Kaya Scodelario as Carina is as close as the movie gets to having a fun, likeable lead. Her silly romance with Henry aside, she is confident and resourceful, easily able to hold her own against the rest of the crude pirates she comes across. So it’s a shame she’s used as a plot device to further Barbossa’s character, because she was doing so fine on her own until then.</p>\n<p>All these characters and plot threads eventually coalesce in a climax that ultimately just comes across as far too convenient for its own good. It doesn’t even matter anyway because the film already peaked with its first silly but fun chase scene back in act one. But you probably won’t even realize this, because at this point the movie has crammed so many special effects, bright lights and poorly lit, seizure-inducing action scenes that your already-dulled brain will be fried to a crisp.</p>\n<p>Who wrote this thing?
