Morgan and Shih pull the strings behind the indie duo known as SALES. Over the past few years, the two have garnered critical buzz with their warm, intoxicating sounds, laying a foundation for the future of pop music on the internet music scene. And on Dec. 7, SALES will be playing a show at SOhO Restaurant and Music Club in downtown Santa Barbara at 8:30 pm.</p>\n<p>“We were never trying to make a lo-fi bedroom sound, but we had lo-fi gear. We worked with what we had. And we continue to reinvest in our studio space. We hope that listeners can hear us leveling up our sound as time goes on,” the duo commented.</p>\n<p>After they met almost 10 years ago in high school Latin class, Morgan and Shih started hanging out and making music together. After high school, however, the two went their separate ways. Shih pursued a solo electronic career under the name JSHIH and Moran moved to Tallahassee, Tenn., where she started a few punk bands (USA-HOLES and DE NADA, to name a couple). When Morgan moved back to Orlando the duo reunited and the project SALES came to fruition.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Shih has a background in hip hop and electronic music and Morgan has roots in classic rock. “Our sound is what happened when we both switched modes: Lauren was inspired to learn Ableton from Jordan and Jordan was inspired to learn guitar from Lauren,” the duo explained. The sonic blend described above elucidates a distinct element of their sound.</p>\n<p>SALES creates an amalgamation of indie, dream pop, hip hop and rock to produce something that is otherworldly to the ear. Their hip hop-influenced production backs electric guitar to create a sound that comes off as simultaneously synthetic and organic. Cuts like “Thurs 6-25” and “Ivy” showcase this unmistakable style. Upon my first listen, the tracks’ simple drum patterns and elegant guitar melodies evoked a melancholic sentimentality I didn’t know existed.</p>\n<p>Since cultivating their striking sound, SALES has toured across the country at a variety of venues, performing initially as a pair. Morgan and Shih noted that their music isn’t designed to be played in a live setting. Rather, they aim to reinterpret their bedroom recordings into an encapsulating live experience. And, to this day, their studio still lies within the confines of four bedroom walls.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79888\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"241215188\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79887\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79888\" data-attachment-id=\"79888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/meet-sales-the-minimalist-pop-duo-that-crafts-bedroom-beats/sales-graphic-final/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SALES Graphic Final\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79888\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SALES-Graphic-Final.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Florida act is set to play in Santa Barbara next Thursday as a stop on their latest headlining West Coast tour with support from Seattle indie-pop band Chaos Chaos. <em>William Emmons / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last year, SALES added a drummer to their roster, replacing the drum machine that Shih previously manned during tour dates. In conjunction with a consequent uptick in energy on stage, the incorporation of a drummer fashions opportunity for more live improvisation, the two explained. Live drumming postulates a uniquely badass aura to their live sets. Drumming on tracks like “Getting It On” displays the degree to which a drummer can potentiate a live sound. The drummer (formerly Joy Cyr, now Malcolm Martin) seamlessly shifts from an acoustic kit to an electronic kit during the song as Shih and Morgan saturate the venue with smooth guitars and angelic vocals.</p>\n<p>With their first releases, SALES put forth a stellar EP and full-length album. Their EP features hit singles such as “Vow” and “Chinese New Year,” generating buzz across the internet. The SALES LP, however, revealed a notably consistent collection of sounds that set the duo apart from their previous catalog and established SALES as an up-and-coming force in music. Since then, the duo has dropped the first single from their upcoming project. “Talk A Lot” is a welcoming coalescence of familiar sounds as well as a maturation of their preceding work. The song builds into a cacophony of swirling vocals and guitar leads, allowing Morgan to demonstrate the breadth of her vocal range.</p>\n<p>One thing that is particularly striking about SALES is their well-curated, thoughtful art direction. In aforementioned work, all album, single and EP cover art, with the exception of “Talk A Lot,” was done by the same artist, Alana Questell. It’s hard to pinpoint why Questell’s artwork so perfectly marries with the duo’s music, but it does so in an irrefutable fashion.</p>\n<p>Analogous to the nature of SALES’ music, Questell’s art is vibrant yet minimal. This trend holds true for the bulk of the group’s catalog; everything from their merch to their music videos exhibits a high level of quality. There’s nothing excessive or superfluous about it — everything that is present in their work serves some sort of purpose.</p>\n<p>Experiencing a manifestation of this aesthetic live is breathtaking. Morgan and Shih reconstruct their studio sound in an unambiguously satisfying style, laying elements of drums and guitar to provide the footing on which the two can flourish into sonic bliss.</p>\n<p>In terms of collaborative work, the two indicated that there are some joint projects on the way. “We have opened up a little more to collaboration and actually worked with a rapper a few weeks ago,” they said. “It was incredibly inspiring and energizing to work in a studio setting with an artist we respect.” In the future, the two hope to have a more established space outside of their bedrooms that could be used as a space for other artists to work collaboratively with the band on future SALES projects.</p>\n<p>SALES takes on the world with a DIY, made-from-scratch mentality. The independent duo is holistically immersed in their craft. “Doing everything ourselves wasn’t supposed to work. People will tell you that you need to join a label to have value and/or a career, but we have proven otherwise,” they said.</p>\n<p>Although money may not be flush for the two, they were both able to finally quit their jobs and focus on SALES full-time. They truly believe in the music they make and surround themselves with those who provide support for their musical endeavors. They bow to no label heads, no industry release cycle — only the organic flow of creativity that sprouts from their passionate work ethic. They release music when they want to, because they want to.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

The sold-out music festival, hosted by comedian Felipe Esparza, attracted a beautifully colorful young and old crowd due to its generationally transcending all-star lineup. The festival featured legendary norteño band Los Tigres del Norte, passionate Latina songstress Kali Uchis, deep and powerful English singer King Krule, indie psychedelic soul rockers Chicano Batman and 30 other diverse performers. The musical acts, along with the assortment of Mexican cuisine, created a festival culture that resonated among the evolving Latinx culture of Southern California.</p>\n</div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To avoid traffic issues, shuttles were arranged to pick up festival goers at the Long Beach Convention Center parking lot and shuttle them to Long Beach Port. Even upon arriving early, there was already a line of eager taco enthusiasts at the gates hoping to cash in on the free taco samples that lasted until four.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Four stages throughout the festival grounds offered a wide range of musical performances. Entering the festival, attendees were greeted by the modest Modelo Stage, which provided a platform for smaller artists, such as the Beach Bums and Jessie Reyes, to perform. It also hosted older performers, like Banda Skalavera and Wanda Jackson, who would be familiar to oldies music lovers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The main stage, Tropicalia, overlooked San Pedro Bay and the Long Beach waterfront, creating a very picturesque atmosphere. Large L.E.D. screens allowed audiences to enjoy views of the band and visuals while standing in the front or sitting on Mexican blankets in the back.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The time approached when our Corona-soaked stomachs began to crave the salty and savory flavors of tacos. A graffiti-covered concrete tunnel bridged the main stage area to the food vendors and the other two stages. Over 20 local vendors boasted a multitude of taco types, from classic birria and vegan to even bánh mì renditions. In addition to tacos, there were other choices such as pozole verde and carnitas taquitos that did not disappoint. The long lines limited the advertised freedom of all-you-can-eat, but people still waited ridiculous amounts of time because, in the end, the tacos were well worth it. The hypnotically smooth sound of Yellow Days could be heard and seen on the Dia De Los Puercos Stage from the taco line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia featured performances that reminded the Latinx audience of family barbeques and birthdays in the park. Celso Pino and Sonora Dinamata, musical staples in the cumbia world, entertained the younger crowd with nostalgia while attracting older audiences to revel in their presence. Cuco, 18-year-old singer from L.A., captured the hearts of the young and old crowd with his modern take on Spanish love songs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia also highlighted many indie bands, including Slow Hollows, Inner Wave and Bane’s World, who recently performed at the KCSB Courtyard, on the intimate Mota Stage. Performing at their first festival, Inner Wave experimented with funky synth sounds and guitar licks, completely jamming out before playing their hits. Long Beach native Bane’s World concluded the night at Mota Stage with their signature dreamy and sentimental sound. The small but loyal crowd was left hungry for more after the set was cut short.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As the sunset illuminated the Tropicalia stage and San Pedro Bay in an orange hue, the headliners began their sets. Café Tacvba, a renowned rock band from Mexico City, played a delightfully eclectic set that was paired with multiple outlandish outfit changes. The Spanish-speaking crowd emotionally sang along as they performed the romantic lyrics of “Como Te Extraño Mi Amor.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">King Krule was next. The sky was now dark and the crowd had anxiously formed around the stage waiting for the English rock sensation. With the release of his new album, <i>The OOZ</i>, followers were excited to hear songs off the album as well as classics like “Baby Blue” and “Easy Easy.” The stage went dark; King Krule stepped on stage with navy lights highlighting his silhouette. Emotionally rich, electrifying and riveting to the core is how we would describe the set, as the audience could feel the passion in his voice.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kali Uchis followed the energy of King Krule, delivering a truly sensational performance and touching the culture of the audience with her Latina prowess. Notably, she asked the crowd to raise their hands if they spoke Spanish, and 90 percent of the crowd proceeded to raise their hands. In Spanish and English she enchanted the crowd with her harmonic, jazz-like voice before humbly thanking and praising the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The next band truly embodied the essence of Tropicalia Fest, blending in rich Chicanx-culture storytelling with their psychedelic soul and funk heavy rock. Chicano Batman, native to L.A., was an emotional high point for many in the crowd. The politically empowering lyrics about the Mexican-American experience paired with their incredibly psychedelic visuals truly made an unforgettable experience.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For its first year, Tropicalia was a success. From its packed lineup to completely sold-out tickets, Tropicalia created a festival that celebrated the Latin American/Chicanx culture that allowed for this artistry to thrive. Whether you belonged to this cultural identity or not, the people were welcoming in the celebration of the organic culture they had created. Although the amazing performances made the day possible, Tropicalia was truly much more than that. Considering the impressiveness of its first year, one can only guess what will come next for this young festival.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/","id":6682,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6681,6680,6679],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Biko House: Punks, Progressives and Politics","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2017-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Time and time again, the Biko House has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial events in the United States. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In September of 2005, the <i>Nexus</i> released an article titled “The Rise of the Biko Empire,” praising the recent influx of, as it described, a “wave of artsy combustion from soft white underbellies” in their garage venue. Most of the article describes the orchestrated chaos brought on by unique and flamboyant bands in 2005.</div>\n</div>\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ending of the article caught my attention, as it asked readers the question, “What’s in store for the future of the Biko House?” Even though I believe the question refers to Biko’s musical scene, I don’t think the writer or any student in 2005 for that matter could have predicted how our world would be today.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I do not want to dive into the details of the United States’ current socio-political climate, but if you don’t know already, it’s bad. It has probably always been bad and my younger self just didn’t take notice. It might have been because politicians were more into dog-whistle politics than directly saying absurd, problematic things out loud. But whatever the reason, Biko’s empire has risen to the occasion and become more than just a musical empire. Keep in mind that my use of the word “empire” isn’t insinuating a single authoritarian rule but, rather, an expansive, all-encompassing multi-faceted entity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79633\" style=\"width: 2071px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"686434280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79633\" data-attachment-id=\"79633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/unnamed-1-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=2061%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2061,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=2061&amp;ssl=1 2061w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko was established to be a safe space for POC in a predominantly white institution, but it has evolved to become an empire of social change, music and solidarity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Time and time again, Biko has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial happenings, like those from 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After the racially charged incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri, Biko’s Garage was open to UCSB faculty and staff, students and local residents to discuss and stand in solidarity with the Mizzou protests. After the recent unfoldings of the presidential election, BIKO has served as an oasis of peace. Activism can be tiring, not just physically but mentally; sometimes that’s not something one wishes to bring back home. Many of Biko’s residents participated and continue participating in progressive work outside of the house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko Garage, Isla Vista’s rectangular punk haven, is a cement room with capacity for maybe three and a half cars, or, on Friday night, 30 or so college kids with adrenaline to burn. Sound bled from the squat building as I approached it last weekend, my heart already in sync with the bass drum’s boom. “Wait!” called my friends, whom I’d started to outpace, but my legs wouldn’t listen. Biko zoomed up in front of us: two adjoined garages, one of which was closed but pulsing with noise; the other serving as a merch tent/lounge where some kids were hanging out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Drawing up to a table on which sat some flyers, a jar stuffed with dirty dollar bills and a pair of hairy forearms, I fished a $20 bill from my pocket and slapped it down, with maybe a bit too much gusto, as the owner of the forearms raised his eyebrows and gave me change. I stuffed the remaining $5 bills into the jar, and together we walked to the door, which was shaking. I gripped the greasy doorknob, turned it and leaned in. The four of us walked into the sun. We surfaced for air, joining the crush of people that had migrated outside, waiting for Genocide Jack. The crowd was, as a whole, black-shirted, lip-pierced and grinning—couple of camo swatches, a spark of Day-Glo hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During a particularly raucous song of the band’s set, lead singer Brian Bellrose crossed the invisible line between stage and stands, whirling around and bouncing off his fans. The zone surrounded me, a pink punk mist. Nothing else mattered. The only distinction between Bellrose and the people who’d paid $5 to see him was the mic, and even that he gave away, giving literal voice to anyone with something to scream. Most of it was indecipherable, but the message was clear, loud and nonverbal: energy so vicious that it’s often misconstrued as anger. This conclusion is evidenced by punk performers’ offstage impressions — I’ve never met one who was anything but gracious, progressive and kind. That night was no exception.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a rousing performance of the Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right,” accompanied by much floor-thrashing, crowd-singing and a heartfelt thank-you from the band, the show was over, and we tumbled back into the night, dazed and a little confused.</p>\n<p>Music, art and activism are what is brewed up in Biko. To continue to stand by its message, Biko additionally tries to prioritize women of color and POC musical performers, but it still opens its doors to everyone. We have seen the future of Biko that was conceptualized back in 2005, and it’s beautiful. Effervescent, colorful, strong and full of spirit; whether it’s the music pumping out of the garage or a presentation on vegetarian inclusiveness, Biko has become a platform for those without platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79632\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79632\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/","id":6486,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6485,6484,6483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tchami Takes on Delirium 2017 with Surging Tracks","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Cheers from the audience roared vivaciously as Tchami began bumping his initial beats shortly before 11 p.m. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This Saturday, Oct. 28, Tchami performed at Delirium for an energetic crowd of UCSB students awaiting quick stabs and a ripping bass. Martin Bresso, more distinctively known as Tchami, is a French DJ and has worked in collaboration with many notable musicians, including AlunaGeorge, DJ Snake and Jack Ü.</p>\n<p>A music career birthed only four years ago has sprouted into a genre of its own, commonly known as future house music. House music aficionado and philosophy major Jessica O’Brien has an apprehensive outlook on future house:</p>\n<p>“Although some future house songs, especially Tchami’s ‘Shot Caller’ are enjoyable to dance to, the genre doesn’t seem to do much for a deep-house frequenter,” she commented. “The bubblegummy lyrics and quick transition from build-up to drop defeats what’s most interesting about a house song. In my opinion, future house, while being fun, simply feeds the listener shallow lyrics and exciting drops as opposed to creating an entirely consuming house experience.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Future house is an electronic dance music (EDM) genre that incorporates a fusion of EDM and deep house music. In an interview with “THUMP,” Tchami stated that “house music in general is full of mature-minded artists who understand the culture,” and he counts on them to take the genre to the next level with him.</p>\n<p>Delirium originated three years ago as a university-hosted event to evade unruly Halloweekend crowds, around the pickup of Tchami’s music career. Some freshmen were taken aback by the severity of enforcements this Halloweekend. First-year communication major Neela Nassiri was incredibly “disappointed that nothing would be going on Halloween weekend” but was “satisfied because [she had] something to do.” She reports that her friend saw Tchami at Hard Summer 2017 and came back with “raving” reviews, which raised her excitement level for the artist. Though Nassiri has never been to an EDM concert before, she is excited to see her favorite Tchami song, “After Life,” live and be in an environment full of UCSB students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79571\" style=\"width: 1044px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1398504913\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79570\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79571\" data-attachment-id=\"79571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/tchami-takes-on-delirium-2017-with-surging-tracks/unnamed-1-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=1034%2C813&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1034,813\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C698&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79571\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C698\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1034&amp;ssl=1 1034w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C604&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C805&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79571\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At 8:45 p.m., the Thunderdome had renovated itself into a laser light show, brimming with color and the sweet sounding trap music of recent UCSB alumnus Underbelly’s set. By 9:20, a big crowd had already formed as students danced rambunctiously to the pre-recorded music. The moshing had already set its course long before Tchami appeared.</p>\n<p>Not too long after 9:30, Morpei, donning a blinding white T-shirt, arrived on stage and immediately amplified the bass. Along with a crowd of students and friends, I formed beat-matching mosh pit after mosh pit, expanding at the build-up and growing at every drop. After a few successfully energetic songs, the DJ ended his set, leaving the crowd sweaty but nonetheless eager for Tchami.</p>\n<p>Cheers from the audience roared vivaciously as Tchami began bumping his initial beats shortly before 11 p.m. A pulsating blue light rhythmically flashed behind the DJ, navigating its way through the depths of the crowd. At this point, everyone was reveling in the sensational sound and the moshing was well underway. I suffered from a few jabs to the jaw as well as soft punches to the head in the rowdy mosh, but it was nothing I couldn’t shake right off to continue dancing.</p>\n<p>Long-time Tchami fan and biology major Ivan Gonzalez most thoroughly enjoyed the song “Afterlife”; he said that was “one of the first songs [he’d] heard” from Tchami and that hearing that song again reminded him of the same performance at Hard Summer, two years back.</p>\n<p>The crowd reacted positively at the turn of each song, indicating familiarity and appreciation for the artist. Even concert-goers at the far end of the stage were rejoicing in the music and dancing just as hard, if not harder, than those in the front. The energy soared consistently throughout the event. Tchami ended his performance with his most popular song, “Adieu,” which incited immense bliss from the crowd.</p>\n<p>To some, Tchami may seem like a run-of-the-mill EDM DJ, but to second-year film studies major Sydney Henrikson, Tchami holds deep sentimental value. She was “so stoked” to see Tchami live, since she has been listening to his music for over a year. In fact, as unbelievable of a combination as it sounds, she danced to Tchami on her first date with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Tchami’s sentiment does not end there. Candace McKeag, a second-year statistics major, said that Tchami is by far her favorite EDM artist. She has been listening to Tchami since 2013, when his first EP came out, and even met her boyfriend at a Tchami concert. “Turn Down for What,” a song that Tchami co-wrote with DJ Snake, ranks among one of Candace’s favorites. Candace hopes her boyfriend will propose to her at an upcoming Tchami event.</p>\n<p>At the event, I also spoke with second-year geology major Thomas Crimmel, who said that he was “most excited to dance with everyone around [him].” Crimmel had a sagacious insight on the entirety of the event: “An entire university and a single artist under a single roof is really something special.” If Thomas could sum up his excitement for Tchami in one phrase, he would simply scream “Tchami!” As I looked at the crowd at Delirium, I noticed that what Thomas said reigned true — smiles from a majority of the students beamed graciously in appreciation of EDM music.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

Sure, everyone has heard songs like “Monster Mash” and “Spooky Scary Skeletons,” and anyone who hasn’t listened to “Thriller” at least once in their lifetime has most likely been living under a rock for the past 30 years. This is a list featuring seven spooky songs you may not have heard before — or, if you have, maybe you never thought to listen to them on Halloween: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Walking On Air” by Kerli</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With its soft trilling notes and eerie imagery, this song has an undeniably creepy air to it. While the chorus is surprisingly catchy and upbeat, the song still manages to maintain an overall ghostly tone throughout, making it perfect for a Halloween playlist. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXMeZwO2qZ0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Creepy Doll” by Jonathan Coulton</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Jonathan Coulton is perhaps better known for writing songs featured in video games (such as “Still Alive” from Portal), but he has written stand-alone songs as well. Most of his songs (if not all of them) seem a little offbeat, but “Creepy Doll” takes the cake when it comes to spooky tunes. His lyrics, set against a chilling melody, tell an unsettling horror story as if you’re the one living it, making it a great choice if you want to curl up in bed with your headphones on a gloomy autumn night. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiEarqIBsdg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Stop, I’m Already Dead” by Deadboy and the Elephantmen</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There’s not much more to this song than a competent electric guitar and the lyrics “I am already dead” and yet, that’s all it really needs. This is a melody that manages to be morbid but fun at the same time. You can enjoy the song year-round, but with its death-centric title and chorus, it feels especially appropriate for Halloween </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E73IQx21DEo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Bloody Mary” by Lady Gaga: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an alias like Mother Monster, it should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga came up with some spooky songs of her own. The way she screams between verses and the way her voice becomes distorted during certain lines gives “Bloody Mary” a disturbing resonance. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFwmKL5OL-Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“King” by The Romanovs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “King” is a siren’s song, telling the tale of a woman who lures men to their death. The melody is accompanied by a haunting harmony, and the song’s steady lilt overall proves beautiful yet macabre, a good fit for a grim holiday. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P911lpDWjp8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Seven Devils” by Florence + the</b> <b>Machine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With lines like “I was dead when I woke up this morning” and “I’ll be dead before the day is done,” this song is undoubtedly chilling. Its slow, dramatic melody adds to the grim mood, as the lyrics paint a picture of someone being hunted down relentlessly. This song may not be the best at parties, but it’s an appropriately dark tune to listen to if you’re putting the finishing touches on your costume or carving a big smile into a pumpkin. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QdpCJIyyi4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Dead Fast Rap” by Boyinaband</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This fast-paced rap is short, sweet and to the point, as it finds as many ways as possible to use the word “dead” in under two minutes. The song uses clever plays-on-words while consistently clinging to a Halloween-appropriate theme of murder and death. The lyrics, seemingly from the perspective of a serial killer, are paired with an eerie beat that ties the whole thing together and makes it ideal for fall festivities. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ0dmeCKExg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a shadow of a doubt, there is a wide variety of spooky, scary Halloween-themed songs out there for you to enjoy.

This is the 23-year-old’s second album under the King Krule moniker, the first being <em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em>, which made waves in 2013 with its eclectic and precociously distinct sound and gained the attention and adoration of such famed artists as Beyoncé and Frank Ocean. But it seems Marshall wants to do some exploring while he’s still young; find himself; rebel a little. What sprung from his unsettled soul was an exercise in bipolar lunacy.</p>\n<p>Throughout the new project, the singer/songwriter/musician/producer whirls from lo-fi to hi-fi, across a spectrum of tempos and from sedated to agitated states in a manner that would be dizzying if it weren’t so seamless. There’s a balance to Marshall’s madness. He expands on the smooth moodiness of <em>6 Feet</em>, but his punk influences enjoy much more air time here. His vocal adaptations to these rougher, more addled sounds are even more compelling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As some of the best things in life, Marshall’s voice is somewhat of an acquired taste. Its abundant richness can be overwhelming to the unaccustomed listener, but the low register and thick South London accent in which he sings provide a rawness much needed in an age when overproduction often sucks the life out of the human voice. King Krule’s music, on the other hand, comes from underneath you, and on this album takes you underwater. This is violently true on the album’s punkier cuts. The restless, distorted guitar riffs on songs like “Dum Surfer” and “Emergency Blimp” do well to complement Marshall’s deep and untethering vocals as they come to an aggravated boil. An echoing, bass-heavy symphony of waves crashes overhead. These songs have you bobbing your whole body and rattling inside it.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Marshall can’t deliver a fantastic slow jam. On the wistfully declarative title track and the down-tempo, syncopated grooves of “Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),” he fishes a jazzy melancholy from the depths of his soul. Tracks like these are the most personal on the album — and beautifully so. Between the latter’s soft weep of guitar chords comes the sobering and pensive reflection, “Why’d you leave me because of my depression? / You used to complete me, but I guess I learned a lesson.” Marshall exhibits a talent for loading and springing coils of emotion in the span of a couple lyrics. On countless occasions, he offers the uncanny prose of the troubled, disaffected mind. The barking refrain of “Slush Puppy,” “Nothin’ is workin’ with me,” bears the artist’s mounting frustration as it floats into the ether, dissipates and surrounds you. To resist absorbing it is thoroughly difficult. Marshall’s thoughts entice you into embracing them as your own, no matter how malignant they announce themselves to be. They wash over you, but they also wash beneath you, through you and within you.</p>\n<p><em>The OOZ</em> is a different atmosphere. Marshall plays the navigator of its deep, dark depths. In this collage of genres and influences, boundaries dissolve. King Krule creates a musical space totally new and unknown, where the recesses of the subconscious manifest as part of the landscape. <em>The OOZ</em> inhabits those late-night hours when the demons of the mind and city slink about. The freedom is theirs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2HRzIyyXvU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tia Rotolo: British singer Archy Marshall — better known as King Krule — returns to music, but not humanity, with the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, Oct. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its induction up until its final note, Marshall’s latest LP is in motion as a distorted expenditure through time and space, abandoning glorifications of permanence. With brutally honest imagery, King Krule wrestles with human emotions, despite making every effort to resent humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album begins slowly with “Biscuit Town.” Airy guitar riffs and static resemble a train moving over tracks. It’s familiar, but there’s something off about it. The track opens, “I seem to sink lower.” His deep, looming vocals immediately capture the listener in a firm grip juxtaposed with the delicate notes of the guitar. The song drops to a beat with every final note in the line lingering for slightly too long, evoking a discomfort that intrigues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s one thing King Krule has mastered, it’s creating something so eerie, so vile yet so addictive. His sound represents a sketchy alleyway at midnight: Even though we know better, we want to see what lies beyond. Howling chilling sounds, he challenges his audience to stay with him against all notions of common sense.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He presents his listener with one question: Where do we go when we don’t fit in anywhere? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His answer lies in a vast unknown, deep oceans and outer space. Both are odes to his previous albums and can be haunting to the average person, but he finds solace in them nonetheless. He’s lost and alone. His only places of belonging are where no one does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A town alarm warns listeners of the commencement of the song, “Sublunary.” In an auto-tuned alien-like voice, King Krule talks of being “made for sublunary,” a reference to an earlier King Krule record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Feet Beneath the Moon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, there are no physics, no humanity, and no emotions; This is where he belongs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sad as the album’s premise is, it doesn’t ask for sympathy. For each melodramatic line, Marshall presents a grotesque image of vomit or mutation, as done in “Lonely Blue.” He is not romantic; he is disgusting and vulgar, but also potent and unapologetic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like a lullaby, “Czech One” emulates a dream state. The song masters the feeling of wanting to fall asleep but being wide awake. Struggling with insomnia, the artist wrestles with the thought of the woman he can’t forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She still sits in my dreams,” he sings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He can’t escape her. Driven to insanity, Marshall and his listeners are invited to mourn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly every line is short and abrupt. This element of disjointment imitates a stream of consciousness, jumping from one thought to the next. What stitches each line together are the instrumentals, mediating the words to comprehension while sustaining the chaos of Marshall’s psyche.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Bermondsey Bosom (Right),” his father talks to the listener delicately over oriental sounds. He references Marshall’s previous albums, speaking as someone who knows him, but may not fully understand him. He’s unable to accept people and finds difficulty in distinguishing “paradise” and “parasites.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Half Man Half Shark,” the singer’s lack of humanity transitions into animalia. He distinguishes himself from others as empty and losing meaning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See world, you’ll never know/At least when you look to the stars they still glow/Well, not for me though</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” he sings, confirming that he’s the only one who can truly understand his own state of mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subtly drifting to a new dimension, the artist takes his listener to “The Cadet Leaps.”  With piano and static, he creates his own atmosphere. He’s lost but surrounded, gazing on humanity from a higher standpoint, watching the parasites and paradise get twisted in their own misconceptions. The listener discovers that the mysterious woman understood his condition and could transcend above humanity with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title track begins with a woman speaking, “Its motion, it’s urgent, its trigger.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King Krule in the background asks, “Is there anybody out there?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song is oozing with something unrefined. Pleas from Marshall include, “Could we align?” He’s desperate for human connection, but with someone who can understand. Melancholy and intricate, he is giving into companionship, slowly drifting back to a human place. “It’s cold by the fire,” he repeats again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album evens out with its closing track, “La Lune,” which uses elements of bass and guitar most resembling his earlier works. In addition to rain drizzling in the background and lighters being lit, he analyzes the human process of becoming the people we fall in love with, saying, “It won’t be long … / Till you’re inside my heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song, as with much of the album, Marshall takes his listener to a familiar place of consciousness, but it’s a place that most people don’t wish to return to if they don’t have to. This is a place of darkness, where light isn’t known by its presence but solely by one’s belief in it. As a physical place, this state of mind can be related to the ocean and space, tying the themes of the album together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of leaving the disturbing mental state, King Krule soaks in its discomfort. In creating his home here, he can no longer be a human being, but instead becomes some adjunct of the universe. Yet, he still wrestles with human needs, as he wishes to be “Elevated with you.” The guitar riffs and static even out and eventually the listener is left alone in silence as the album ends simply and modestly. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is depressive, sometimes manic, but always unforgiving. King Krule does not wish to evoke sympathy or some romanticized images of the depression which ails him. He’s basking in the originality and repugnance of his suffering. He’s full of guilt and regret, but he’s recognized the value of these emotions. Attempting to find his position in time and space, he wrestles with what we know and what we’ve yet to truly understand about the human condition. There are no false idealizations of a physical home, but merely a presentation of a mental state worth diving into.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79201\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79201\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/","id":6679,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6678,6677,6676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Loving Vincent’ Captures Van Gogh in Motion","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":" Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Loving Vincent,” by directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, functions oddly as a work of art. It is by no means a bad film; in fact, by many measures, it is a masterpiece. Inspired by the life and work of Vincent van Gogh, “Loving Vincent” is the first fully painted feature film. Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours. Their work and talent is manifested in the film, which is never anything less than visually stunning. That is the ‘how’ of the movie, and it is beyond reproach. As a work of visual art, “Loving Vincent” deserves to be seen by everyone with even a passing interest in Vincent van Gogh.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, “Loving Vincent” is not a painting. It is a movie, and as a movie, it is rarely more than, well, fine. The movie is never atrociously bad. “Loving Vincent” follows Armand, the son of Vincent van Gogh’s postman, as he attempts to deliver Van Gogh’s last letter, a year after van Gogh’s death.  In the process of finding the rightful owner of the letter, Armand learns more about the man and is drawn into the mystery of van Gogh’s apparent suicide. What follows is a meandering and low-stakes murder mystery that feels utterly inconsequential — even in the basic description of the movie’s plot, it begins to feel like a little bit of a stretch. The protagonist has too little to do with the subject. The story is not enticing, and it has little narrative drive. Great effort is made to incorporate the subjects of van Gogh’s actual paintings into the narrative. The thought of that is nice, but it only slows the plot even further. In this movie, every frame is a memorial of the great artist, and every time it is to the expense of the elements of a film that typically differentiate film from the other visual mediums.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"190192479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79341\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79342\" data-attachment-id=\"79342\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/vg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vg…\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79342\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The movie is about a murder mystery a year removed from all of the action, which is already centuries removed from us. It begs the question: “Why am I watching this? This is not interesting.” Van Gogh is only present in the occasional black and white flashback, so for a movie dedicated as a monument to the painter, we see frustratingly little of him. We mostly hear about him, through the mouths of all the characters he knew and painted. Thus the movie finds itself making the critical mistake of showing nearly nothing and telling almost everything. The mistake is especially confounding when the basic premise of the movie is its visual potency. It is a gorgeous film, but it is mostly a film of talking heads. What I would give for a more kinetic film in this style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The performances in the film are fine. They’re an odd mix of live action and animation, as actors performed the scenes on soundstages for the animators to paint over. The actors fill their painted world with little charms, but can do little to elevate their material to any sense of urgency or importance. It’s hard for the actors to get over the fact that all of their lines are biographical exposition.</p>\n<p>I’m left with an odd feeling after watching the film. There are many things that stuck out to me as mistakes. There are many things about it that I will gleefully criticize because, in many ways, it is a bad movie.</p>\n<p>But I loved it.</p>\n<p>In spite of all of its flaws as a film, it was an entrancing experience. The amount of love that went into it over a period of years is palpable. The love can be felt in the soft, ever-so-slightly changing brush strokes and in the credits as I watched the names of hundreds of artists fly by. The movie is, warts and all, an impressive testament to the lasting powers of art and the impression it has made on so many people through so many years. From van Gogh to the directors, the directors to their team of tireless painters and the painters to us.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, there is a scene where two drunks get into a fight. It’s a relatively complicated shot, with the camera weaving between the two figures. Here is when the illusion of the film is at its strongest, where the two art forms meet. As it stands, “Loving Vincent” is only a masterpiece of painting and a mediocre film. The movie shies away from motion most of the time, leaving it static like a painting. If it committed to its hybrid nature more often and strived to be a movie worth engaging with as well as art worth watching, it would be truly sublime.</p>\n<p>As it is, it is only beautiful.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/","id":5806,"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen"},"related":[5805,5804,5803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tchami to Play Delirium 2017","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21768350_1408033682650423_5966092855119465649_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21768350_1408033682650423_5966092855119465649_n.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"Regarded as a trailblazer of his genre, future house — a subgenre of electronic dance music that possesses a combination of deep house and EDM tendencies — Tchami hit the mainstream in 2013 after ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Parisian DJ Tchami has been announced as the sole headliner in the fourth installment of Delirium, A.S. Program Board’s Gaucho-only Halloween concert. Set to take place on Saturday Oct. 28 at 8:30 p.m. in the Thunderdome, Tchami joins the ranks of previous headliners Young the Giant, Snoop Dogg and YG. Tchami is the first of the future house genre to hold the coveted position of headliner, though after an overwhelmingly positive response following RL Grime’s appearance at the post-Deltopia concert, the Warm Up, it is no wonder why A.S. Program Board has ventured more into deejay sets.</p>\n<p>Delirium was initially introduced as a measure to reduce crime rates associated with Halloween celebrations in Isla Vista. The past few years have been met with a strong police presence, 6 p.m. noise ordinances and ads discouraging out-of-towners from coming to Isla Vista. However, students are not certain that the concert actually deters the deviance associated with I.V. Halloweens. “It depends on who’s playing. The year that Grouplove played, the attendance was pretty low, but the year Snoop Dogg played there were bodies packed in [the Thunderdome],” Marisa Ratchford, a fourth year film and media studies major, said. First year pre-biology major Andrew Keller supports her assertion, “It’s definitely about star power. No one’s going to do stuff in the Halloween time frame, but if you have a big name, people will go.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79323\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"459010528\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79322\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79323\" data-attachment-id=\"79323\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/tchami-to-play-delirium-2017/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?fit=960%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Tchami&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79323\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22552722_1429238660529925_979470078382862582_n.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79323\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Tchami</p></div>\n<p>Regarded as a trailblazer of his genre, future house — a subgenre of electronic dance music that possesses a combination of deep house and EDM tendencies — Tchami hit the mainstream in 2013 after his remix of Janet Jackson’s “Go Deep” gained major popularity. He earned more recognition after some of his remixes began playing in nightclubs across Europe, as well as his producer’s credit on DJ Snake and Lil Jon’s “Turn Down For What.” The multitalented artist, real name Martin Bresso, is also a producer as well as a priest. His stage presence ties into his godly past, as he is known for performing in a clerical collar, which he insists has a very serious meaning. He told <em>Vice</em> in early 2015, “I don’t want to be misunderstood on this one…Like many people, I am a spiritual person, so the outfit I am wearing is reflecting my spirituality. There is no joke or mockery in this. Music is about sharing something deep with each other. I hope that what I’m wearing is leading people to listen to the music in a different way. I just want my music to make people feel good and hopeful for their own future.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While Tchami may not be as well-known as previous headliners, he is certainly on the rise. He has toured with Skrillex, DJ Snake and Diplo and has remixed and collaborated with AlunaGeorge, Martin Garrix and Jack Ü, among others.</p>\n<p>Tchami first assumed his poster-boy status for his genre after his first EP <em>Promesses</em> was released online by Fool’s Gold Records in late 2013. The titular song on the album, which was rereleased as a single, peaked at No. 7 on the Official Singles Chart. His inaugural single with Spinnin’ Records, “Untrue,” was released in April 2014. In 2015 the DJ-priest added producer to his repertoire when he launched his own Paris-based record label, Confessions, which now boasts a respectable 27 artists.</p>\n<p>Under his new record label, Tchami released the<em> After Life EP</em> in 2015 before taking an eight month hiatus from music. During that time, his remix of AlunaGeorge’s song “You Know You Like It” was featured in the movie “We Are Your Friends,” which stars Zac Efron as a struggling EDM DJ. Following his brief respite, Tchami returned with a free online release of “SIAW” (“Step Into A World”) and released his one single of 2016, “Prophecy,” in his first collaboration with fellow Confessions member Malaa.</p>\n<p>In February of this year, he released one of his most popular singles to date, “Adieu,” in what acted as the prelude to his newest album, <em>Revelation</em>. He spent part of 2016 and early 2017 on DJ Snake and Mercer’s “Pardon My French Tour,” as well as his own “The Prophecy Tour.”</p>\n<p>While this is not Tchami’s first visit to Santa Barbara, this is his first time at UCSB.

The California rockers performed West Coast-infused tracks that entangled both eccentric narratives and blissful instrumentation.</p>\n<p>Sharp Shock, a band with members from across the world, kicked off the night with a performance of the gritty guitar-led track, “Infatuation.” The band kept the momentum going throughout the first couple of songs off the setlist, but the crowd began to get physically anxious to see SWMRS grace the stage.</p>\n<p>The adrenaline of a garage rock show is comparable to drinking 10 Vietnamese iced coffees in one sitting. Bay-area band SWMRS rose to prominence after releasing their album <em>Drive North</em>, which featured heavy doses of hip-hop and punk instrumental influences. The rumbling chorus of “Palm Trees” ignited the opening of SWMRS’s set. The moshing antics at punk shows often lead to dissenting touching, which lead singer Cole Becker is adamantly against. Becker warned the audience, “If somebody is touching you in an inappropriate way, punch that dude in the face, and if you don’t wanna punch them, we’ll gladly do it for you.” During small breaks between songs, Becker would use the time to make political commentary. “Fascism is on the rise in America. We need to unite during times like these and put an end to the injustices. And if you don’t remember anything from this show, at least remember that black lives matter.” This statement induced the crowd to give a round of applause for the band’s ability to use their own voices to spread a theme of inclusivity within their shows. SWMRS finds a way to vocalize the themes of diversity and openness both within the frame of a three-minute song and in the way they inform their fans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Once the “Miley is a punk rock queen” hook rang out, the crowd began losing their pastel pink vans among the sea of teens loosening their pent-up aggression. During the drowsy love ballad “Lose It,” Max Becker stepped on top of the speakers to allow the crowd to sing along into his microphones. The hypnotic trance of Joey Armstrong’s drums on the performance of “Figuring It Out” even had a father of two children briskly meander his way into a mosh pit made up of 17-year-olds rocking overalls. The final song of the night was “Drive North,” which details the trivialities of Los Angeles. Becker laughed heartily and sang out the names of bands that have become synonymous with the Los Angeles DIY scene: “I hate FIDLAR, I hate Together Pangea.” Becker stopped the performance midway to give hand gestures indicative of heightening the mosh pit intensity. The band has evolved from the previous time they came to Santa Barbara, where they performed to a small crowd at the Funzone. Previously, the crowd only knew two songs the band put out on the “Miley/Uncool” EP. Flash forward to 2017, the band had Velvet Jones packed with teenagers knowing the lyrics to every song of <em>Drive North.</em></p>\n<p>After the brief delay for The Interrupters’ set, the vast majority of the crowd was doused in sweat from moshing. This was third-year UCSB biology major Edith Martinez’s third time seeing SWMRS perform. She recalled her admiration for the band’s lively performances: “This SWMRS show was by far the best show I have ever attended. The energy of not only the band but the crowd was intoxicating. I enjoyed singing along with my friends. This was truly a night I will never forget.”</p>\n<p>The Interrupters stepped onto the stage clad in suits and performed “A Friend Like Me,” from their self-titled 2014 album. Despite the crowd reducing in size after SWMRS wrapped up their performance, The Interrupters captivated the attention of the crowd by performing the head-banging track “She Got Arrested.” Throughout the performance of “Take Back the Power,” lead vocalist Aimee Allen’s raspy voice remained reminiscent of an early 2000s Gwen Stefani. The Interrupters embraced the unfamiliar as they fused elements of horn instruments with the backbone of the punk scene, the electric guitar.</p>\n<p>The radiant atmosphere of a punk show is centered on celebrating individuality and uniting over a mutual admiration for moshing. Punk shows offer you moments to be completely free from worrying about your midterm coming up next week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/swmrs-deliver-exhilarating-sounds-at-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/swmrs-deliver-exhilarating-sounds-at-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/swmrs-deliver-exhilarating-sounds-at-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/swmrs-deliver-exhilarating-sounds-at-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/swmrs-deliver-exhilarating-sounds-at-velvet-jones/","id":6677,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6676,6675,6674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Cry Cry Cry by Wolf Parade","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wolfparade-crycrycry-3000.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wolfparade-crycrycry-3000.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Wolf Parade isn’t afraid to take risks on their comeback album.

And in the indie rock luminaries’ first full-length album in seven years, vocalists Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner are belting their hearts out onto the table in true Wolf Parade fashion. <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> has all the energy of a sugar-filled toddler tucked into bed with a blanket of dejection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In “Valley Boy,” the album’s first single, the band provides a valley filled to the brim with sonic sweets. It deepens and spills over, the drums, guitars and vocals trading center stage and playing off of each other like actors in a meticulous drama. The subject of the drama appears to be a David Bowie-esque figure, a beloved singer lost to the realm of the dead whose last phase in life holds some mystery. (And who’s to say it’s not Bowie himself? The icon is a noted influence of the band, after all.) The lyrics are accusatory; they sound as if they are spoken by a distraught fan or old friend of the famous songster. Krug asks the deceased singer questions he can’t answer: “Are you still a lover boy? / Are you still on the cover or / Did you become a valley boy out there?” He obsesses over how this singer could have possibly lost his lovely and sincere disposition, and he dreads this betrayal. This hostility is a thin veil for grief. Emotions contend and pull Krug in every direction, but his confusion sounds so good.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRslooNX4Js?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Similarly equivocal is <em>Cry Cry Cry</em>’s second single, “You’re Dreaming.” Boeckner grabs the mic to bemoan the daydream of the information age in a blissfully sardonic number. Although the dream is a bad one taking place in a fantasy world inseparable from violence and destruction, there’s so much excitement in its sound. The song introduces itself with the cheeky staccato of a keyboard. Guitars electrically weave in and out of the melody, helping to drive the beat forward in the verses and constructing flaring bridges between them. Lyrics and sonics ascend into the deceptively jubilant howl of an individual trapped in a bad dream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wolf Parade isn’t afraid to take risks on their comeback album. The linear “Incantation” is them at their most assertive and unafraid. The band unleashes a horn section after the song’s first dive into cacophony, a tornado of twinkling keys and buzzing guitars. The guitars win out with bursting notes but quickly pull back to let the piano begin a forceful trot that just as quickly reconvenes with its instrumental co-conspirators, who by the end of it are wailing and stomping their feet. Where “Incantation” is a deliberate march into chaos, “Flies on the Sun” is a woozy march through the oppressive sands of time. By its fourth and final minute, you’re teetering on the brink of collapse. By the end, you’re one of many “flies on the sun, lying there.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All of these songs, however, are bite-sized treats compared to the king-sized “Baby Blue” and “Weaponized.” These six-minute tracks make up the core of the album, and they are a one-two that reckons with the best of them. The great control and eccentricity Wolf Parade displays in these power ballads is the band at its most impressive. “Baby Blue” is an epic display of the band’s capability. It sounds like a battle royale taking place in a locomotive that’s careening around corners and through mountains. “Weaponized” is a bit more measured. A skillful combination of anxious energy and bleeding soul backs Boeckner’s singing about a battle with yourself that feels like a battle against the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Modern-day isolation is certainly a recurring theme, but Wolf Parade is not saying they have any solutions for it. While Krug tangles himself in the pain of isolation on “Am I an Alien Here,” Boeckner begs for it on “Artificial Life.” He pleads for some peace and quiet in a soundscape like the world of a broken arcade game that he’s been sucked into. What the band finally arrives at, though, is a question. The closing track, “King of Piss and Paper,” is a meditation on the political and social state of the world. Wolf Parade asks if it’s okay to sing about love and ourselves at this time in a geopolitical environment led by a fear and hate-mongering papier-mâché man. This “king” threatens people’s ways of life and, in a way, love itself. So is it wrong to ignore him to attend to ourselves and each other, even if for a second? Isn’t it wrong that it feels that way?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This fear, this hatred, these illusions and their concomitant feelings of overstimulation and alienation stand front and center in the album. What Wolf Parade did with <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> was give voice to those emotions of the modern age that swirl in the chaos. They gave us a thoughtfully grand exhibition of the sickness of the times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79199\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79199\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/","id":6676,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6675,6674,6673],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Marshall’ Tackles Racism with Simplicity and Warmth","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its most basic plot summary, “Marshall” concerns two lawyers working a difficult case. NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall and insurance lawyer Sam Friedman are the defense in the case of Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur accused of the rape and attempted murder of his boss’s wife — who is white — in the 1940s segregationist America. The judge compounds the difficulty of their situation by ruling that Marshall cannot speak during the trial, justifying this by stating he’s an out-of-state lawyer.</p>\n<p>Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client is innocent, while arguing in a court with a white judge, jury and prosecution. The odds are astronomically stacked against them, making this very much an underdog story. This is magnified especially since Marshall is fighting on behalf of civil rights, all while risking the reputation of the NAACP by taking on the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79206\" style=\"width: 2157px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1444187541\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79205\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79206\" data-attachment-id=\"79206\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/unnamed-1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=2147%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2147,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C532&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79206\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C533\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=2147&amp;ssl=1 2147w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C614&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79206\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Broadway Filmore Alive</p></div>\n<p>Even though Marshall and Friedman come from two different social backgrounds and types of legal practices, they have more in common than they think.

Friedman makes it clear that he is neither experienced enough nor happy to be the leading defensive attorney, and Marshall is very much frustrated at having to continually pester Friedman into defending Spell. As the film goes on and their friendship grows, the two wring some warm comedy out of one another, Marshall setting up one particularly rib-tickling joke about Friedman’s courtroom prowess.</p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman of “Black Panther” and Josh Gad play the two lawyers. According to director Reginald Hudlin, who spoke to Durling at the screening, Boseman was reluctant to take on another historical role after “42” and “Get on Up.” But after reading the script, he was on board to play the Supreme Court justice. He portrays Marshall with a weaponized, steely confidence that makes him immune to the prejudice he encounters. He’s unwilling to give up and bow down despite the daunting odds that he is confronted with. Nevertheless, he is still made vulnerable by tragedies that arise within his own family.</p>\n<p>Gad subtly makes it clear in his first scene, a small courtroom case, that Friedman feels unfulfilled and maybe even a little ashamed about being an insurance lawyer. When he has the opportunity to do some good, he is immediately concerned for his reputation and his family. As he and Marshall dig deeper into the case, Friedman becomes more involved both in Spell’s case and the greater issue of civil rights. Like Marshall, his own family must deal with personal tragedy, his own tied to the conquests of the Nazis.</p>\n<p>At times, though, the film to steers into melodrama. One hokey scene has Marshall stand on the steps of the courthouse and make a big speech about the Constitution to assembled reporters as dramatic music plays. It’s a little much, but the film brings the tone back around through Spell. Sterling K. Brown does a sublime job at playing a terrified man whose innocence is very much in question. His skin color is serving to continue to make his life a living hell. He makes this clear in court with an impassioned speech on what could happen to him as a black man, moving even the ambiguously racist judge (played by James Cromwell).</p>\n<p>The film is based on a true story, with heavy creative input from Friedman’s daughter (who portrays, ironically enough, a racist). As with many films like this one, it’s difficult to discern what is 100 percent true, but that does not take away from the film at all. At the film screening in the Riviera Theatre, Hudlin said he wanted to make a film that would make people come out and tell their friends, “Aw, that movie was so good!” and not “That movie’s really important, you gotta see it.”</p>\n<p>“Marshall” is entertaining, socially relevant and delivers doses of humor to balance out the gravity of the subject matter.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/","id":5801,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5800,5799,5798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Blade Runner 2049’ Creates a New Future from the Same Story","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Blade Runner 2049” is not a pretty picture of the future. Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements. Apartment building hallways are cramped with the homeless and sick. Flying, heavily armed cars race across the sky as oppressive, electronic tones courtesy of Hans Zimmer blast in your ears. It tells you immediately that the world you see in front of you is oppressive, unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this neo-noir destitution, artificially created humans called “replicants” continue to be produced for slave labor. Specialized LAPD detectives called “blade runners” hunt down the older models, many of whom just want to be left alone.</p>\n<p>Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is one such “blade runner.” It quickly becomes clear that K is not a particularly remarkable person; he’s very robotic, stone-faced and unemotional. Although he occasionally questions the ethics of his job, he still carries it out, believing he has no choice in the matter. Even if the film doesn’t dig too deep into initial motivations, K still serves as the catalyst by which the film asks questions regarding the nature of the human and the artificial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For instance, take K’s holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas). Although copied and pasted from a mass-produced template and encoded onto a thumb drive for the sake of portability, Joi manages to demonstrate a degree of self-awareness. In a stroke of brevity and intelligence, the film never quite makes it clear if her growing independence evolved by itself or was programmed into her. Even though she has at least a small degree of freedom of movement, Joi yearns to overcome her existence as a mere product, seeking emotional fulfillment. I’m not familiar with Ana de Armas or her work, but I think she certainly has the chops to tackle more dramatic roles in the future if she so wishes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79204\" style=\"width: 1915px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1547592895\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79203\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79204\" data-attachment-id=\"79204\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/unnamed-46/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=1905%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1905,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=888%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79204\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=888%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1905&amp;ssl=1 1905w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Movie Database</p></div>\n<p>This desire to be human, or to transcend it, is the thread holding the entire post-Ridley Scott tapestry together. What looks like a very bland story on paper — a cop uncovers a conspiracy with huge ramifications for society — delves into K’s past and forces him to ask himself questions about himself and what it all means for him and for the replicants. The movie continues the story from the original “Blade Runner” in a fascinating way that subversively pulls on tried-and-true sci-fi tropes.</p>\n<p>In the process of K’s investigation, we are introduced to Jared Leto in a role that allows him to spout the most forgettable philosophy babble I’ve heard since “Transcendence.” He’s the face behind the faceless entity that is corporate greed, and as antagonists go, he’s not up to snuff. He emotes very little and there is hardly any backstory present to flesh him out. His henchwoman Luv comes across as more complex, if perhaps a little contradictory. Perhaps, if you listen closely as Leto goes on about the nature of replicants in his silky tones, you might find yourself being lulled into a nap.</p>\n<p>On the flip side of Mr. ASMR, “2049” brings back original “Blade Runner” protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). While Deckard doesn’t show up until toward the end of the second act, he ties into K’s story in a fascinating, even subversive way that pulls from the events and consequences of the original film. Anyone looking to catch a bone regarding the long-persisting theory regarding whether or not Deckard’s a replicant isn’t going to find anything to gnaw on. It’s no longer his story to question the nature of humanity but instead the implications of it being able to evolve.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, the movie is not just a philosophical slog, I promise. You’re still going to get some shootouts and good ol’ robot fisticuff brawling. There’s entertainment to be had, but this isn’t joining the likes of “Fury Road” and “The Force Awakens” among the pantheon of 30-years-later blockbuster action sequels. “Blade Runner 2049” takes its time to get to its payoff — perhaps a little too much time. There’s so much excess that an entire subplot alluding to a replicant revolution goes absolutely nowhere. Sequel bait, perhaps? “Blade Runner 2079”?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/","id":5800,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5799,5798,5797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Andrew Bird Soars with Melodic Sounds at Campbell","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Behind his aslant silhouette on stage, the visual recording of Echolocations: River played on a backdrop.

His sheer musical talent gives way to an unequivocally enticing and nimble sound. Bird is well-known for his virtuosic violin technique along with expert whistling, vocals and intermittent additional instruments. This previous Saturday, Oct. 14, his cult following did not disappoint, completely filling Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The minute I took my seat, I tuned into anticipation-filled murmurs from the crowd; audience members remarked on Bird’s extensive set-up compared to previous performances. Bird silently arrived onstage as the lights shut off to accommodate his hushed entrance; the soothing sound of his electric violin immediately followed. Bird began with notable pieces from his newest album, <em>Echolocations: River</em>, an eight-track album recorded while he was standing in the Los Angeles River.</p>\n<p>Behind his aslant silhouette on stage, the visual recording of <em>Echolocations: River</em> played on a backdrop. Bird plays the violin in sequence with the video projection. The violin’s ring bounced around the auditorium, a soft bowing along with poignant staccato. I wondered why Bird did not play the entirety of the melodies live until I grasped that he was acting as his own “echo” for the astonishing live experience of<em> Echolocations</em>. He focuses on reverberating to his own tracks, allowing for a sweet-sounding resonance. After playing roughly three tracks of his newest album, Bird reverted to performing <em>Echolocations: Canyon,</em> part one of his newest album. At this point, the backdrop began to project bright lineaments that coalesced, representing the landscape corresponding to each album title. The mesmerizing, contouring lines morphed exquisitely to complement the music of Bird’s violin.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It wasn’t until his debut of <em>Echolocations</em> came to a halt that Andrew Bird began to speak, enchanting the audience with his soft and somewhat carefree voice. He informed the crowd that he worked with NASA in order to contrive the rather hypnotic backdrop by using geodata to contrive a three-dimensional spatial render of the locations in which <em>Echolocations</em> (part one and two) were recorded.</p>\n<p>Bird then transitioned from<em> Echolocations</em> to what he considered a more traditional setting, inviting two of his other band members, drummer Abraham Rounds and guitarist Alan Hampton, to the stage. He enthused the audience with a seven-minute rendition of “Capsized”, accompanied by pleasing effervescent light transitions behind him. Bird confidently moved through several pieces, including “Why, Are You Serious,” Roma Fade” and an upbeat unreleased song.</p>\n<p>“Why,” one of his more popular songs, is revered for its dreamy tone and aloof vocals that blend fittingly with the song’s lyrics. He admitted the second-person narrative of the song that sings “How I wish it was your temper you were throwing / Damn you for being so easygoing” is actually a reflection on his own passivity. This comic self-deprecation roused laughter from the wholly involved crowd.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79211\" style=\"width: 1151px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1099169906\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79210\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79211\" data-attachment-id=\"79211\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/andrew-bird-soars-with-melodic-sounds-at-campbell/unnamed-47/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1141%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1141,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C934&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79211\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C934\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1141&amp;ssl=1 1141w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C808&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=974%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Bird topped the series of fan favorites with the quirky and generally adored “Roma Fade.” “That song is incredibly difficult to play,” Bird admitted at the end of “Roma Fade.” He then brusquely unplugged his electric violin and moved over to an intimate acoustic setup on the side of the stage.</p>\n<p>The next series of songs were an incredibly moving and expressive bunch, including “My Sister’s Tiny Hands,” “Orpheo” and “Three White Horses.” For these songs, the mood shifted to a more folkloric, tale-telling atmosphere. Bird showed clear emotional divestment through this acoustic performance; the soft vibrato of his violin allowed for an immense melodic anticipation.</p>\n<p>He ended the show with the highly awaited “Pulaski at Night.” Unfolding the story behind the song, Bird said, “It was [inspired by] a foreign exchange student visiting us from Thailand who said, ‘I want to see ‘Pulaski at Night.’ ” This statement was followed by bursts of laughter. Bird himself found this to be amusing because “Pulaski” is “a fascinating street that runs the whole length of Chicago and the whole west side — but it’s a tough street, he disclosed.</p>\n<p>I gave Bird a standing ovation at the conclusion of “Pulaski,” a song I had been waiting to hear all night. He thanked the crowd for a wonderful night and humbly walked off stage. My expectations were exceeded by his talent and capability to put on a fascinating show. But as I looked at T-shirts being sold near the exit, I heard the soft sigh of his violin return from inside. I quickly made my way back into the venue to witness Bird playing a cover of Neil Young’s “Harvest,” as well as his own “Danse Caribe.” Bird undoubtedly gave an exceptional show filled with finger-pickings, new songs, talented vocals and homages to favorite artists.</p>\n<p>I had a chance to speak with Jenny, a recent graduate and engineer as well as a six-year-long fan of Bird, after the show. She remarked that “Pulaski at Night” as well as <em>Echolocations: River </em>were a surprise to her, proving the ingenuity of Bird’s performances.</p>\n<p>Bird’s fans “bowed down” to his impressive sound-craft and engaging performance. I was personally amazed by the gentle yet incredibly passionate musicianship I experienced during the acoustic segment of the concert. His live songs were performed with a unique timbre, paralleled by recorded versions, giving an extremely genuine touch to the performance. The same way Bird is able to merge the manifestation of multiple instruments, he is able to mingle multiple genres into one whole.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

The beautiful flowers that bloom on the trees are a very powerful symbol in Japanese culture, and the gift was meant to establish a lasting peace and friendship between the two countries. Fast forward to 2017 and the trees have grown and evolved in the new context of a bustling New York City, and Sakura Park stands as a living, breathing example of cultural unity. Despite some fluctuation in international relations, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig has intricately crafted his weird, quirky and creatively flawed internet-era version of Sakura Park. His new anime Netflix Original starring Jaden Smith is “Neo Yokio,” an imperfect yet extremely dynamic model of the exaggerated tropes of both New York and Japanese cultures. The work is a living culture shock, and although not worthy of high regard or reward, it is more than anything commendable for its creative liberties and merely the fact that it even exists in the first place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio,” or the Japanese form of “New York,” blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force. These three seemingly random movements, however, have been blending together for quite some time now. Recently, we have been seeing SoundCloud rappers with anime-ridden profiles, and the clothing brand A Bathing Ape is more prevalent than ever in the states. Rapper Lil Uzi Vert (who happens to look like an anime character himself) posts about “Cowboy Bebop” on his Instagram, and of course, the cult-classic anime-meets-black-television show, “The Boondocks,” remains a legendary piece of small screen history. But “Neo Yokio” seems to directly blend cultures more than ever before, so much so that it has become the main attraction of the show.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio” follows the extremely wealthy socialite and coveted bachelor Kaz Kaan, who is voiced by Jaden Smith. Kaz frequently wears high fashion brands such as Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, he is the star of his preppy field hockey team, he attends high-class parties and balls and he gets flown around town by his robot butler. His Aunt Agatha, voiced by Susan Sarandon, looks out for him and arranges appointments for his other important hobby, exorcizing demons. This leads to the first main issue with “Neo Yokio”; it has way too much going on. The work often struggles to navigate back and forth between socialite life, young city life and the wild card of demon exorcism. However, this excess does not prevent the show from maintaining excitement, commentary, occasional humor and unique style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Outside of the saturated and scattered plot, “Neo Yokio” finds more value visually and stylistically more than anything else. The show looks beautiful on screen, and the creative character design works well in front of quality voice acting, specifically from Jaden Smith. Much like the enigmatic young prodigy, the show constantly finds redeeming moments of weird yet profound intelligence and artistry. Quotes like, “Who cares what time it is when the future is an interminable abyss of wackiness?” and “Demon be gone from this Chanel suit!” are examples of the kind of perplexing weirdness that, whether you like or not, can be appreciated.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79105\" style=\"width: 825px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1921343512\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79105\" data-attachment-id=\"79105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/unnamed-45/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"815,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79105\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?w=815&amp;ssl=1 815w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Behind all the nonsense and randomness of this fascinating creation, there is a deeper commentary on materiality, elitism, capitalism and fandom. Throughout the colorful landscapes of Neo Yokio, Kaz is frequently seen worrying about comically insignificant things, including wearing a midnight blue suit to a black and white ball, the rundown status of his childhood home in the Hamptons and his constant belittling for being “neo-riche.” He also constantly refers to his ex-girlfriend, Cathy, who he can’t seem to get over. In this sense, Kaz functions as a modern-day animated Hamlet, coming from extreme wealth and constantly distraught and complaining about love and the world around him. This character functions well in the New York context, a clear critique of the materialistic and elitist culture that upscale cities maintain. A more direct critique of this is Neo Yokio’s list of most eligible bachelors, which appears to be a nod to “One Punch Man”’s hero rankings. In Neo Yokio, young male bachelors are ranked in a fluctuating list posted in the middle of the city. Kaz is seen going up and down on this list throughout the show, greatly influencing his perception in the public eye as well as his general happiness. This is not only a fascinating dialogue about the elite social classes in modern society, but also an interesting response to the mixed reviews that the show has been receiving. Elements like these are some of the quirks that make “Neo Yokio” a success in its details, rather than the big picture.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As far as traditional anime is concerned, “Neo Yokio” is nothing revolutionary or even memorable on a narrative level. “Neo Yokio” is more than just weird, as it also often can be choppy, strange and lacking fluidity in storytelling. This show may often bring the audience to laugh when they’re not supposed to, be taken aback by the dialogue and question what even just happened on-screen. Despite these things, “Neo Yokio” demands a watch and, more importantly, a discussion because of its unique ability to blend cultures, create profound creative moments, provoke thought and make memories. Whether or not it resonates with you or at times even succeeds to make sense, “Neo Yokio” guarantees an experience that is memorable and by all means entertaining.</p>\n<p>This is a show that, despite mixed critical reception and even accusations of appropriation, should be appreciated and enjoyed for its role in blending cultures. Even more so, we should celebrate the fact that Ezra Koenig made an anime with Jaden Smith about a demon-exorcising socialite in New York and was able to have Netflix fund it. We should celebrate the fact that we live in a time where strange art like this can be created and distributed at such a high rate. We should also celebrate the fact that, in an ever-divisive world, strange art like this has an audience. Perhaps it has less historical significance and general impact on the world than the real Sakura Park, but the ridiculous and outrageous “Neo Yokio” is still worthy of our attention and should be celebrated for its cultural push.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/","id":5788,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5787,5786,5785],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":18,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
