He is young and energetic, he acts on impulse and he has an alarmingly fierce dedication to his craft. His first two albums were rodeo-themed, as Scott was understanding and learning to control his inner beast, while his recent effort, <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, </i>depicts him hunched over with large bird wings, displaying the full incarnation of his inner animal.</p>\n<p>The best illustration of Travis as an animal, however, is the notorious reputation of his live presence. At a Travis Scott show, the rapper and his dedicated audience are wild in every sense of the word. Travis jumps around and screams into the mic like a man possessed, water bottles and shirts fly everywhere and mosh pits open up and rage with energy only a wild animal can posses. This all being said, it was more than appropriate when the internet and rap community went into a crazed frenzy on March 8 when Travis Scott announced phase one of his Birds Eye View tour, which includes a stop at the famous Santa Barbara Bowl.</p>\n<p>This tour announcement, which also includes stops in Europe and across the U.S., has been in the making since last August when the southern madman released his long-awaited second studio album, <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i>. This album was well worth the wait, as its long collection of bangers gave him a No. 1 debut on Billboard as well as positive reception from all major music blogs. Among its consistent strong energy are hits “Goosebumps<i>,</i>” featuring Compton prophet Kendrick Lamar, and mega hit “Pick Up the Phone,” featuring wild card Young Thug and Migos icon Quavo.Despite this very strong recent effort from Travis, it is in no way the beginning of his musical success. His dark production and surreal, heavily autotuned sound have been rising since his mixtape <i>Days Before Rodeo </i>and his next-year debut studio album <i>Rodeo</i>. While <i>Days Before Rodeo</i> featured high octane collaborations with Young Thug and Migos, <i>Rodeo</i> launched Scott into serious mainstream success, specifically on the coattails of monumental banger “Antidote.” After he was recognized as a young powerhouse in rap, it was not long before listeners discovered the rest of his full, strong discography and slowly magnified the young rapper into the icon he is now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Infamous general admission seats at this show in particular sold out in less than an hour, and many stops on the tour have already sold out completely. Travis is looking to make this a huge year for his live shows, as these coming shows are merely “phase one” of the bigger Birds Eye View tour. He is also listed on many festival lineups, including the world-famous Coachella bill. This is his first string of shows since the rowdy Rodeo tour with Young Thug in 2015, and this time around he is bringing along rising star Khalid and frequent collaborators Virgil Abloh and Chase B.</p>\n<p>As this tour will surely attest, Travis Scott is an animal in the unpredictable and chaotic rap game. His shows are hectic, belligerent and without any sign of civilization. After a career of building to this level of monumental success, this explosion at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be a victory lap as well as a commanding power forward. The evil genius has already announced another studio album for 2017 entitled <i>Astroworld</i> as well as a collaborative album with Quavo, so this is only the beginning of 2017 for Scott. Now is an extremely exciting time for Scott and the community as they get to celebrate the genius of a young artist and the monumental energy of his booming success.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/","id":6540,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6539,6538,6537],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lucidity Fest’s Blissful Gathering Set for This Weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/E-CLYNES-LUCID16-SMUGMUG-254.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/E-CLYNES-LUCID16-SMUGMUG-254.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While many will attend Lucidity this year for its renowned workshops on permaculture, sustainability, spirituality and community-building, the music takes precedence over all for a significant portion...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Spring is now upon us, and I am pleased to announce that the verdant magicks of the Santa Ynez hills have been fully rejuvenated by this year’s abundant rainfall. In just a little over a week, from April 7-9, Santa Barbara’s own Live Oak Campground will be transformed into a cornucopia of sight and sound as the Lucidity Festival congregates there for its sixth meeting. The finale to Lucidity’s six-year story arc beginning in 2012, this year’s celebration will be ripe with music, workshops, yoga, art and tasty, locally sourced food.</p>\n<p>For its sixth year, the community has adopted Eudaimonia as its theme, a concept with origins in ancient Greek philosophy. Alison Hensley, Lucidity’s food and sustainability head, describes Eudaimonia as a complex concept with many various interpretations: “It’s the good composed of all goods. An ability which suffices for living well. Perfection in respect of virtue. Resources sufficient for a living creature.” If these words do not fully capture the spirit of Eudaimonia, perhaps that is because no words can.  If you desire to learn more, maybe a more direct encounter with the ideal at some kind of transformational festival could provide you with the holistic knowledge you seek.</p>\n<p>While many will attend Lucidity this year for its renowned workshops on permaculture, sustainability, spirituality and community-building, the music takes precedence over all for a significant portion of festival-goers. These are the people who drool over newly announced lineups like freshly cooked plates of teriyaki tempeh, and Lucidity’s lineups will not leave them disappointed this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The Lucid stage, situated in the festival’s heart, will feature prominent psychedelic dub and drum-n-bas British producers Ott and dBridge, as well as a bounty of other electronic acts.  The Nest, inside of the Lover’s Nest village, seems to be the hub of more intimate, lyrically driven performances by the likes of Canadian world music group Delhi 2 Dublin as well as the faerie-like Ayla Nereo.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Nook stage at the Nomad’s Nook village is set up to be more of a funky, harder-dancing arena toeing the all-too-thin line between group trance and discotheque.  Throughout the weekend the tables will spin hypnotically under the command of Christian Martin, Low Steppa and a panoply of other techno and deep house wizards. One to watch out for among the group is NYC DJ Manik, hailing from Queens; he is able to blend classic and acid house with subtle funk and disco beats in a way few are able to do. The Nook stage will also feature a tribute to beloved Lucidity DJ Nicholas “Pumpkin” Alvarado, who unfortunately passed away in 2016.</p>\n<p>The amount of articles about self-care going around social media right now is astounding, so I know there is a chance readers will just tune out these next couple of sentences, but <i>festivals are a space in which self-care is vital!</i> For those of you trekking out to the Lucidity festival next weekend, make sure you pack yourself meals, drink plenty of water and remember to get at least a little sleep! That way, you will be at peak awareness for the strange beast that is Lucidity.</p>\n<p><i>Lucidity Fest </i><i>tickets are still on sale, and readers can use the code </i><b><i>LucidityFest2017</i></b><i> for a special discount.  </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/lucidity-fests-last-hurrah-set-for-next-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/lucidity-fests-last-hurrah-set-for-next-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/lucidity-fests-last-hurrah-set-for-next-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/lucidity-fests-last-hurrah-set-for-next-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/lucidity-fests-last-hurrah-set-for-next-week/","id":6539,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6538,6537,6536],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rising Duo Joyzu Bring Bright Sounds to SB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a cold Thursday night, a packed crowd filled the dimly lit dance floor at M8TRX nightclub in downtown Santa Barbara. The club goers were rowdy and ready for Joyzu to play their set. Many were there because they were familiar with the duo’s name but weren’t sure how they would perform live. As the two small-town kids took over the reins, a Joyzu remix of “We Will Rock You” by Queen started to play. With heavy themes centered around trap styles, the build up to the song established high-tension energy in the room. Suddenly, the carbon dioxide cannons filled with cold air fired off on the dance floor as the drop hit. The lights, lasers and specially made Joyzu graphics danced and supplemented the beat and drops in breathtaking fashion: they came to rock the people of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joyzu, an EDM music group from the small town of El Dorado Hills, Calif., features two young producers, Carson Willms and Quinton Pope. At the respective ages of 22 and 21 years old, the two small-town kids have already built an impressive résumé that is making big-city crowds take notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After releasing their hit single “Hear You Say,” the group gained momentum, even garnering major-label attention. Willms and Pope, as you know now, are not your typical college DJs, but are your common college students. Willms and Pope attend college, work jobs, occasionally talk to girls and are busy making their way through the EDM music scene.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been best friends ever since middle school, but got into dance music around the beginning of high school,” Willms and Pope said in a joint interview.  “We fell in love with the genre so much that is pushed us to pursue production and DJing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The love and passion they share for the music definitely shows in their product. While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows. The duo danced around on stage, head banged and threw their hands up and down as epic beats dropped on their audience in epic fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Joyzu had so much fun with their music, the crowd responded with relentless energy. Of course the music itself was incredible, but the true difference was the distinct feel in the crowd once Joyzu took the stage and started playing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are many inspirations that inspire us to keep pursuing music. One being our favorite artists that we look up to who continue to push boundaries, such as Porter Robinson, Skrillex, Zeds Dead, What so Not, Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino, just to name a few,” they said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of their artistic influences can be heard in their music. Still, the music Joyzu produces maintains a unique sound that must be heard to fully understand. As someone who admittedly does not listen to much EDM music, their music can best be described as high energy, with amazing drops that are not too over the top — a nice change of pace from the music of most electronic duos. The music is also complemented with precise vocals and lyrics that extend the energy of the music even further. The music itself, let alone the incredibly fun atmosphere the two producers create, will leave you wondering how these guys get paid to have this much fun.

This gothic novel follows the story of a charming young socialite by the name of Dorian Gray and his demise as he learns of the beauty he possesses and the power he bestows with it. The novel begins with the famous artist Basil Hallward showing Lord Henry his recent portrait of a man he chooses not to disclose, in fear of the impact Henry will exert on the innocent man. Evidently, the gorgeous man himself, Dorian, stumbles upon the studio and crosses paths with Henry. From there, Henry influences Dorian into the scandalous life that soon follows, to Basil’s dismay. Dorian leads a life of pretentious, glamorous luxury, with his fate unraveling before he knows it as he remains forever young — literally. Not even the death of his lover halts this hedonistic lifestyle. However, while Dorian has chosen to sell his soul to the aesthetics, his portrait seems to show us what lies beneath the handsome facade, and it isn’t very pretty. Lavish perfumes, grand fabrics and exquisite gems mean nothing with all the sin and evil behind it. Wilde illustrates the power of beauty, told with beauty, unraveling a dark and enchanting tale about of the power of art. He reflects his philosophy toward the Aesthetic Movement that was taking rise in Victorian England, telling the readers that art is nothing but beauty. To look beyond its appearance would do you no good. Wilde is taking this well-known concept  and conveying how the adoption of uncontrolled aestheticism will eventually bring about selfless actions and lack of empathy. With wit, eloquent prose, dry humor and quotable dialogue, this classic tells the typical “innocence to corrupt” moral, and it’s all very, very tragic.</p>\n<p>Lauren Bennett on <i>Apex Hides the Hurt</i> by Colson Whitehead</p>\n<p>How do you create a name that reflects an entire community’s values? Given our country’s state of political polarization, how do we unite ourselves and advance? Colson Whitehead explores these topics of morals, media and political polarization in this deeply nuanced novel. <i>Apex Hides the Hurt </i>follows the life of a nameless narrator, a nomenclature consultant, with an uncanny ability to perfectly name products. The narrator’s namelessness, personhood and his career force the reader to confront ideals of black postmodernism and the notions of what constructs the “self,” prompting the reader to critique truth and authenticity in print capital. He is tasked with renaming Winthrop, a Midwestern suburb, with a name that satisfies the divided citizens. The three members of the city council all have different names in mind for the city. Albie Winthrop, the sole heir of the town’s colonizer, wants to keep the town’s history intact, insisting that Winthrop remain the name. Regina Goode, a descendant of the slaves who settled the town, seeks to honor the hardships of these founders with the name “Freedom.” And Lucky Aberdeen, a software virtuoso, aspires to launch the town into economic and technological prosperity with the name “New Prospera.” This linguistic conflict reflects divides that still remain in today’s political climate: the more conservative preference of honoring tradition, the liberal desire of receiving reparations or the progressive ideal of blazing new trails of innovation and technology. During the denouement of the novel, the narrator chooses a name for the town of Winthrop that is unsettling for the denizens and the reader but quintessentially encapsulates the points Whitehead constructs about the politics of race, space, academia and the power of language in this bright and piquant read.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/its-lit-can-a-word-narrate-a-thousand-pictures/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/its-lit-can-a-word-narrate-a-thousand-pictures/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/its-lit-can-a-word-narrate-a-thousand-pictures/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/its-lit-can-a-word-narrate-a-thousand-pictures/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/its-lit-can-a-word-narrate-a-thousand-pictures/","id":6955,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[6954,6953,6952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Diehl and Salvant Conclude UCSB’s Jazz Revival","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=930%2C400&ssl=1","description":"This final installment of the Jazz series represented the legacy of musical talent: combining classic music with new prominent artists.

In the dim light of Campbell Hall, I could see smiles and mouths agape in awe and after every song or hear people gasp and whisper words of astonished praise. This kind of reaction comes from an appreciation of a time-honored American tradition: a celebration of 20th century culture and the musical legacy of people from across the nation. At the finale of UCSB’s Jazz series, artists Aaron Diehl, Adam Birnbaum and Cécile McLorin Salvant brought that musical tradition to life.</p>\n<p>UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures concluded a collection of jazz performances on Tuesday night with “Jelly and George: Celebrating the Music of Jelly Roll Morton &amp; George Gershwin.” The event featured a group of prominent contemporary jazz musicians, including Diehl and Birnbaum on the piano and Salvant as the ensemble’s vocalist. The performance showcased some of Morton and Gershwin’s more obscure jazz compositions, written at the beginning of the jazz age in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>\n<p>“These are two very important American composers,” Diehl explained, “but they never knew each other.

The song began with the dual pianos, Diehl and Birnbaum, joining in counter melody. Birnbaum’s hands flowed down the keys, creating a sound effect like something falling. Diehl countered the other pianist’s flair with high, magical-sounding trills. The song transitioned to a steadier, more forceful rhythm as Paul Sikivie increased his volume on the bass.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Leathers on the drums gave the song a New Orleans vibe with heavy use of the snare. The southern jazz style was complete as three other musicians on trombone, trumpet and clarinet emerged from backstage, playing with clear, bright tones.</p>\n<p>The next Morton song, “Sidewalk Blues,” used the full ensemble to create a different musical atmosphere. The song began with Leathers blowing a train whistle and honking a car horn, while the rest of the musicians shouted and called to each other from across the stage. The cacophony of noise mimicked the soundscape of a downtown city street. The song transitioned from a steady beat that built with the whine of the trumpet to a peaceful, lulling duet between trumpet and clarinet, like a leisurely stroll. The soothing melody was continuously interrupted, however, by the train and car sounds. Through music, the band was able to recreate the environment of urban 20th century America.</p>\n<p>As Salvant took the stage, the audience roared with excitement, signifying her presence and success within the jazz community. Low, pounding piano began the song “I Hate A Man Like You,” creating a dark, angry tone. Salvant’s vocals started off slow and sassy, getting higher and more nasal, as though mocking someone. As the song continued, her voice grew louder and deeper with stylishly retro vibrato and rich, full low notes. She grinded her voice fiercely at the beginning of the third verse, mirroring the song’s spiteful lyrics. Her vocals carried the emotional weight of the song and told its story through inflection.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76321\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"495809154\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76320\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76321\" data-attachment-id=\"76321\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/aarondiehl_cecilemcloransalvant_930x400/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=930%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"930,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76321\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400-250x108.jpg?resize=250%2C108\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"108\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?w=930&amp;ssl=1 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Kuumbwa Jazz</p></div>\n<p>The tone of the performance changed completely with the next number, “Black Bottom Stomp.” Diehl felt that the piece “combines the best of New Orleans and Chicago jazz.” The clip-clopping percussion complimented the upbeat and cheery melody with Brandon Lee blasting high notes on the trumpet. Diehl and Birnbaum’s piano solos recalled the ragtime style with energetic and quick piano chords and a mixture of both high and low notes.</p>\n<p>After the whirlwind of the upbeat tune, Corey Wilcox thrilled the audience with an elaborate trombone solo. The number was filled with anticipation as Wilcox began with low, vibrating tones and slowly began to climb to higher notes. The other band members began clapping along and shouting words of encouragement as the trombone wailed through clear, high notes. Wilcox demonstrated his control of the sound with trills and stylistic wavering in the notes. After each sustained wail, audience members gasped and a few even hooted with approval. When the piece ended, the crowd went wild with applause and whistles.</p>\n<p>The final song, “I Got Rhythm,” served as a reminder of jazz’s role in American popular culture. The number started with a deconstructed melody, with each instrument playing a fragment of the familiar tune. The band members comically interacted with each other, Leathers using his train whistle and car horn again, while Evan Christopher squeaked out high notes on his clarinet. The musicians hollered and shouted at one another and began the upbeat, catchy tempo with heavy percussion and a steady baseline. Salvant returned to the stage with a clear, sweet voice as she sang the nostalgic lyrics with a friendly smile. The entire band finished together with one final appreciation for jazz music and jazz culture.</p>\n<p>The show inspired both admiration and awe in audience members as the crowd leapt up in an immediate standing ovation after the finale. Music lovers of all ages buzzed with excitement and words of praise as they left the theatre, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of jazz on the entire country. This final installment of the Jazz series represented the legacy of musical talent: combining classic music with new prominent artists.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/","id":6694,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6693,6692,6691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Logan’ is a Movie for the Comic Books","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Ever since his first appearance, Wolverine has been one of the most beloved characters in the X-Men film franchise. Actor Hugh Jackman has played this part so well that his version of the character has become a very recognizable pop culture icon in recent years. Now, after eight movies, he will end his long run as the well-known superhero in his final film as the mutant hero, “Logan.”</p>\n<p>It’s the year 2029, and mutants have been nearly extinct. Wolverine, or Logan, has lost his healing ability, and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has been affected by Alzheimer’s, which has left him unable to fully control his powers. They are on the edge of the Mexican border, working to eventually live a better life, when they accept the calling of a woman who wants them to escort a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across America to the Canadian border.</p>\n<p>Despite developing over the course of the franchise, Jackman’s character undergoes the fabled hero’s journey as if his character is just being introduced to us. By placing huge limitations on his mutant powers, Wolverine feels different from how he was in past installments, as tension for his life slowly begins to rise. While it is slightly helpful to understand Logan’s relationship with Charles Xavier in past films, one does not need to know any specific events of previous entries to follow this film’s plot. It almost seems as though director James Mangold approached this story as if the other X-Men movies never happened.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of this, “Logan” distances itself from all previous X-Men installments tonally and stylistically, as it earns an R rating. Apart from bloodier action scenes and more profanity, Mangold uses this opportunity to create a more mature movie. The themes and mood reflect this, as the setting is not as colorful as it was in the franchise. The cinematography and costume design suggest a harsher world, where the threat from the enemy is worse than ever. With this setup, Mangold tries to break apart from the comic book genre to make something entirely different. Despite having great action scenes, the best moments of the movie were the simple character moments that the MCU movies typically don’t care to include. Sharing themes with the stories “Children of Men” or “The Last of Us,” the comic book elements are seamlessly integrated into the film, as the movie doesn’t feel remotely like a “comic book movie.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76316\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"239781688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76314\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76316\" data-attachment-id=\"76316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/logan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"logan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>That is, until the second half.</p>\n<p>Up to this point, the film was nearly flawless. There might have been a few technical issues and some slight over-acting from Patrick Stewart, but perhaps I was just nitpicking at the movie. However, the film truly does reach a climax, because the film starts to falter right after its best moments. The pacing starts to drag, and major plot elements slowly become sillier. In the first half, the film felt like a neo-Western that simply included four mutants, as it relied on the various character arcs and interactions instead of “comic book elements” to progress the story forward. With the introduction of a younger Wolverine clone, the increased inclusion of Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant) and his plan involving mutant children, the film started to take a dive back into being a comic book movie. The second half isn’t completely awful; it’s just that the first half had such a perfect balance that it set high expectations for the rest of the film.</p>\n<p>However, because of these expectations, even the smallest falters made the film appear more unbalanced, as the comic book elements became very present. As more characters were introduced, the film started to become overcomplicated. With these sudden inclusions, the film removed some of the realistic, serious undertones that the first half was spent building upon. The biggest strength of the first half was that there was almost a complete lack of superpowers used in a superhero movie. Even then, the mutant powers fit the mood that the film set for itself. But as the film went into the second half, it seemed as if characters and scenes were written into the script just so the film could make other major moments happen. If the screenwriters did a few more tweaks, they could have still gotten to these moments while staying true to the tone they set for the film. The characters established in the first half could easily hold the movie on their own. Those who appeared in the second half could have just been mentioned, and the film would have worked just fine.</p>\n<p>Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre (as most people are suggesting for the film overall). If the film was strong throughout, then it would certainly be “The Dark Knight” of the X-Men franchise. But as it stands now, it is solely a solid comic book film. While Jackman didn’t end his 17-year run as Wolverine on the best note possible, he sure did end on a great one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/","id":5831,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5830,5829,5828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Favorites Clean Spill Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=960%2C639&ssl=1","description":"As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I watched members from both Clean Spill and The Buttertones pace back and forth throughout the room, faces gleamed at the sight of their existence, and I, too, was overcome by the emotion that caused us all to gape in unison. The crowd was filled with seemingly familiar bodies all bent on making the most of their post-adolescence. From the grunge attire to the wavering course of conversation that struck the air, it was evident that this show attracted a particular scene. SOhO is home to an array of sounds, yet it often sees bands like Clean Spill leaving the comfort of Isla Vista and making a home on stage at their venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean Spill took the stage with lead vocalist Pat Curren capturing the center of the room in a bright red turtleneck, exhibiting the sort of confidence heard in his voice. He was visibly calm and collected, projecting any amount of anxiety he could have on to the crowd through a baffling amount of talent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved. As someone who has seen the band numerous times, I have yet to hear them perform an identifiably similar setlist. Aside from songs like “Sid” and “Come Around,” their music can be exceptionally challenging to find via most music streaming platforms, so it is common for people to only know those particular songs. While one may come to hear a particular song, they may not only hear it but also experience something better. The band performed a song that I had yet to hear, knocking the crowd off of their feet and into something dressed to sound a little bit like love. After closing my eyes to make the most of this feeling, I opened them to see several people in the room doing the same.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Clean Spill ended, The Buttertones began an alternative journey through the soundtrack of an aching romance for their first-ever show in Santa Barbara. Each member took the stage decked in their own twist to their stylish attire, spouting sounds of angst and words of love. Watching them perform, drenched in the colors of the disco ball that orbited the space above them, aided to the art of their melodic, hopelessly romantic appeal, which caused the couples in the room to slow dance as if their hearts were on fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They brought a bit of everything to their set with old-school harmonies, saxophone and a combination of everything in between. Although furthest from the crowd, drummer Modesto “Cobi” Cobiån was perhaps the most enjoyable to watch as he drummed like there was a world inside of him. The visible vibrations off of the drumset and his head full of hair, which looked like it was trying to get a piece of the action, were by far too captivating to not take notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each progressing song, The Buttertones professedly became better and better. Frontman Richard Araiza led the crowd down a sun-kissed road through performances of songs like “Dionysus” and “Orpheus Under the Influence.” With the upcoming release of their new album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gravedigging</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is fair to say that we can be expecting a lot more shows from this band, and if we are lucky, dates that land in Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hanni El Khatib closed out a now-full room at SOhO, shattering what was left of a will to resist the need to break free.

Electro-jazz bass talent Stephen Bruner, better known as Thundercat, and his collective label Brainfeeder, has been a powerful influence on the modern hip-hop and R&amp;B scene for quite some time now. Bruner and his mastermind collaborator, Flying Lotus, were major producers for Kendrick Lamar’s earth-shattering masterpiece </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Pimp a Butterfly,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Thundercat himself has added his colorful production to many important artists, such as Mac Miller, Childish Gambino and even the iconic Miss Erykah Badu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, there has been a gradual push in hip-hop and R&amp;B toward a more melodic, jazz-influenced sound and Thundercat has been a steady force. One listen to this vibrant and beautifully disorienting odyssey that is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and this push becomes overwhelmingly apparent. This record, however, is monumental for Bruner, as he is finally stepping out from behind the curtain and taking center stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated before, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an odyssey if music has ever heard one. It begins appropriately with opening track “Rabbot Ho,” and then continues to descend into a conceptual drunk madness. The album begins as most wild nights do, upbeat and light, then progresses as the substance seeps in, bringing out darker thoughts and emotions only to end with tracks “3AM,” “Drunk,” “The Turn Down” and “DUI.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying Lotus is an extremely present voice on this project, as the track list shows him featuring on eight of the23 songs. Although the whole album rings with his abstract and lucid approach, the project does not lack individuality. There is a clear and distinct Thundercat sound throughout. His production is solid and diverse, whether it be his vintage bass walk on cult hit “Them Changes,” the surreal electronic drive of “Friend Zone” or the smooth instrumental groove of “Jethro.” This impressive musical effort keeps listeners engaged throughout and provides a fresh and new sound to the music community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The colorful production that moves this album is also equally matched by a very clean and strong vocal performance from Bruner. His voice is a smooth glowing entity that is wonderfully unique to his work. The melodies he creates are a perfect match for his production: distinct, different and jazzy. The work showcases a few features as well such as Pharrell Williams, jazz icon Kenny Loggins and the legendary rap prodigy Kendrick Lamar. These artists specifically are no strangers to this wave of music that Thundercat has engineered and add their own influence effortlessly on their respective tracks. The one sore thumb on the ballot, however, comes at the hands of weed-glorifying master of mediocrity, Wiz Khalifa. As Khalifa is not exactly what you would call an acclaimed music artist, he seems a bit out of place on the track “Drink Dat.” Despite this apparent setback, it hardly halts the strong track and it is thoroughly surrounded by excellence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another X factor on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the unique comedic twist that Bruner has incorporated into his lyrics. Whether it’s his painfully honest claim to “beat your meat, go to sleep,” his “Dragon Ball Z” references or his literal meowing over the track “A Fan’s Mail,” the weird quirky sneak peak into Thundercat’s life makes for honest lyricism and a comedic talent similar to that of singer-songwriter Father John Misty. Once again, we can observe great cohesiveness as his odd twist in his words accents his unique production eloquently</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these quirks that make the album true to Bruner, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is at the end of the day a thematic existential crisis that shows an artist struggling, asking questions and answering them simultaneously. Thundercat’s lyrics continually show him contemplating death, the fleeting construct of time, madness, love, police brutality and everything in between. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s title track near the album’s close shows our hero on the negative side of the substance-use spectrum, pleading that “I’m drowning away all of the pain till I’m totally numb, sometimes you want to feel alive, but not on someone else’s time.” Painfully honest statements like these along with little nuggets such as “It’s okay to disconnect sometimes,” makes this album a profound and moving work to go through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an age old saying, especially prominent in the college setting, that goes along the lines of this: “Drunk statements are just sober thoughts.” On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of the mind. This album is intelligently and elegantly drunk, and at it’s best moments, even wasted, in every sense of the word. It is eccentric, cringeworthy, silly, sad and, most of all, honest. Drunk hits home with its ability to be all of these extreme things and still remain alarmingly relatable to all who listen. Although surely we are not all similar to the mastermind that is Stephen Bruner, we now know that we are struggling with similar staggering, crippling, sloppy drunk issues. It is these issues and Thundercat’s complex dance with them that makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the most compelling musical quests of the year thus far.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/","id":6807,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6806,6805,6804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shy Girls and Culver Provide Warmth for Perfect Park","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With a Lorde-like hand motion, Vidmar from Shy Girls truly immersed himself in the essence of atmospheric music.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The otherworldly presence of Shy Girls and Culver revived Friday’s star-saturated evening during I.V.

The smooth production of Shy Girls set the night a flare, the crowd graced with smiles at the romantic lyrics Dan Vidmar translated from his mind into the microphone.</p>\n<p>The precedent performer of the night Culver from Orange County somewhat outshined the main act by displaying his ability to sing a slew of cover songs at the drop of a hat. Culver brought the sparse crowd together and eradicated the awkward atmosphere that permeated the audience. The narrative of his set list dealt with heartbreaking scenarios and offered the audience a perspective into Culver’s mind. The intimacy between Culver and the 40 or so members of the audience was instinctively felt, as people sniffled, maybe due to the frigid weather or the solace they found in the sorrow radiating from his lyrics. Second-year biology major Chloe Anderson stated, “He [Culver] reminds me of an early Lewis Watson.”<br>\nA lengthy silence followed a round of applause after his third song of the night, in which Culver enthusiastically stated, “I’m gonna play yet another sad song!”<br>\nThe onslaught of emotional songs basked in honesty provided a deepened connection between the audience and Culver compared to how the night’s headliner, Shy Girls, decided to approach the crowd. Due to the late arrival of Shy Girls, Culver had to extend his set by 15 minutes, in which he played Norah Jones and Tracy Chapman covers to keep the crowd attentive.<br>\nHis rendition of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” was halted as Culver respectively mentioned, “To be honest with you guys I can’t finish the song because, I genuinely forgot some of the lyrics. I don’t want anyone beating me up for messing up this song.”<br>\nThe land of Portland conjures up beloved mental images of singer-songwriter Elliot Smith, the infamous feminist bookstore sketch in “Portlandia” and cold brew. Yet, the lovely Pacific Northwest town is also the origin of Dan Vidmar, the face of electronic R&amp;B act Shy Girls. The performances of the night were split into two different factions, those of heartening ballads dealing with emotionally draining subject matter and those of entrancing dance melodies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76121\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"597923929\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76120\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76121\" data-attachment-id=\"76121\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/shy-girls-and-culver-provide-warmth-for-perfect-park/shy-girls-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1523&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1523\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shy girls 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=888%2C661&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76121\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2-250x186.jpg?resize=250%2C186\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"186\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Shy Girls</p></div>\n<p>Shy Girls’ latest project, titled Salt, has Vidmar’s silky tenor radiating within refined percussion. The name “Shy Girls” might strike familiarity with the UCSB audience, as he lent his vocals to the previous Extravaganza headliner Odesza on the track “All We Need.” Vidmar’s R&amp;B falsettos can easily be collaborated with the likes of Daniel Caesar or BadBadNotGood to make a hit. The minimalism entrenched in Shy Girls’ sound only adds to the meticulously produced foggy ambiance.<br>\nVidmar took the stage and, with a breathy voice, coaxed the crowd to come closer so he could see their faces. With a Lorde-like hand motion, Vidmar from Shy Girls truly immersed himself in the essence of atmospheric music. Atmospheric music can often be labeled as rather “boring” and “dull” if you’re not on a substance-induced high. Despite this, Shy Girls had the entirety of the crowd moving to their eclectic sound in ways reminiscent of Taylor Swift’s infamous dances. Only accompanied by his guitar player, Vidmar’s vocals became increasingly intriguing, as the instrumentation highlighted his presence on stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The multifaceted track “Watercolor Dreams” from Shy Girls’ album Salt pays homage to Vidmar’s teenage years spent listening to Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. Straying from the safety net of the synth, Vidmar experiments with guitar riffs and drums to intertwine rock elements with a song dedicated to painting the false facades of people in a relationship. The soulful edge brought by Vidmar’s guitar performance highlights the pop melodies of songs like “Say You Will” and elicited a perpetual sway throughout the crowd.</p>\n<p>Chiara Smith, a political science major, stated, “Besides the lack of people in attendance, all the performers put on great sets.”<br>\nShy Girls concluded the night with an abstract performance of their hit “Second Heartbreak,” leaving a magical numb feeling that resonated with the audience. Everyone walked home in a state of bliss from the live, soul-warming music they witnessed. If you ever need an escape from a house party playing the same top-40 rap hits, support A.S.

The band has amassed an amalgamation of work with artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Mick Jenkins, Kaytranada and MF Doom. BADBADNOTGOOD even produced an LP entitled Sour Soul for Ghostface Killah in 2015. Since their origin in 2010, the group has navigated through stylistic expressions of jazz, instrumental hip hop, free improvisation and electronica whilst establishing an iconic and distinct sound.</p>\n<p>The venue’s panoptic design arranged the crowd in a way that made the room seem occupied from wall to wall. Well-worn ’90s R&amp;B radio hits played in the background as concertgoers found their spots and conversed amongst each other. At around 8:30 p.m., San Marcos native London O’Connor took the stage with an arrangement of airy and whimsical cuts from his debut album O∆. O’Connor’s lyrics touched on themes of identity, expression and creativity. His closing track, “Guts,” dismantled the notion of a cookie-cutter lifestyle — confronting his suburban upbringing with in-your-face lyricism that is sure to provoke many kinds of thought.</p>\n<p>Former member of the Odd Future collective, Hodgy, followed O’Connor’s performance. Hodgy’s set was ominous and overflowing with emotionally charged verses as his raspy words vivaciously filled the depth of the venue. Just behind the DJ booth, Hodgy’s 5-year-old son, Trenton, peeked over its top during his father’s set. The California rapper provided a plethora of songs from his debut LP, Fireplace: TheNotTheOtherSide, and even performed a song over the instrumental of Kendrick Lamar’s “Sing About Me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the gap between Hodgy’s set and BADBADNOTGOOD, more quirky radio hits played in the background mix. Attendees in all corners of the venue danced to the mix as “In the Air Tonight” by Phil Collins boiled up into a climax of irony and laughter. Then, Leland Whitty, the band’s saxophonist, was first to take the stage, dancing toward the front as he played a rendition of The Champs’s “Tequila.” Shortly after, the rest of the band joined to finish the song and commence their performance.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76119\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"608227828\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76118\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76119\" data-attachment-id=\"76119\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/badbadnotgood-bring-a-spectacular-show/jpg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?fit=1088%2C816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1088,816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\".jpg\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76119\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file-250x188.jpg?resize=250%2C188\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed-file.jpg?w=1088&amp;ssl=1 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>BADBADNOTGOOD kicked off their set with an illustrious blend of unreleased original composition. The rest of the set was comprised predominantly of tracks off the group’s latest album, IV, though a few tracks from III were performed as well. BBNG’s performance style is unique; their peculiarity compliments the intensity of their music in a way that is simultaneously exhilarating and easygoing. Each song appeared to seamlessly blend into the next, most cuts lasting longer than 10 or 15 minutes, respectively. I found myself drifting into the depth of their music, confronted with difficulty in identifying the margins of each track.</p>\n<p>The band’s performance of “Kaleidoscope” was intoxicatingly memorable. Audience members sang along with the central riff of the track as the band’s drummer, Alex Sowinski, led his bandmates into a climactic and sporadic peak. At the precipice of this peak, the pit condensed to half its original size until fans broke out into a near-mosh pit; some might find it odd to see people enjoy jazz music so vivaciously. Sowinski’s performance was thrilling; his charismatic presence and tactical skill postulated a loving and humorous ambiance.<br>\nIn addition to musical exhibition, BADBADNOTGOOD interacted quite a bit with the crowd. Band members encouraged the audience to raise their hands and reach toward the stage as they jokingly pretended to play catch with various attendees. Whitty, the band’s newest member, was arguably the most fun out of them all. For the latter half of the performance, the saxophonist went barefoot whilst parading outlandish facial expressions and body language as he ripped rich notes on tenor sax.</p>\n<p>At various points throughout the show, some members would simply leave the set and go backstage to grab a drink for a bit. Even something this overt and abnormal was difficult to pick up on as the remaining members fashioned such a full and encapsulating sound on their own. The band’s original keyboardist, Matthew Tavares, has not performed with the group for some time. Instead, musician James Hill has toured with the group during their latest stint on the road. And, although many argue that the group is incomplete without the original member, Hill held his own and incorporated a distinct style into the outing.</p>\n<p>The band’s performance of “CS60,” the outro track from their third studio album, was an energetic highlight of the show. The instrumentation slowly came into focus as deep synthesizers saturated the backdrop of the track until Sowinski began drumming. The hook of this cut sounds like something taken from the score of a blood-pumping thriller flick. An array of unique sounds certainly warranted the animated head-bobbing that was reciprocated by the crowd.</p>\n<p>Although BBNG may be characterized as a jazz band, the boundaries of their sound do not by any means fall within the traditional confines of jazz as a genre. The ever-illustrious personalities of the band members exhibited one of the most energetic live performances I have ever seen. It is no surprise that this group has had the privilege of working with such prominent musical influences as they have. Few bands can provide the same magnitude of excitement, confusion and eccentricity as BADBADNOTGOOD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

Not only is it an incredibly tense, ridiculously funny and shockingly unnerving film, but it’s also an immersive thrill-ride. While the film is surprisingly impressive, it’s even more jaw-dropping when you consider that “Get Out” is Jordan Peele’s directorial debut. While Peele brings along his knack for humor, don’t be deceived; “Get Out” is intensely thrilling and insanely smart. It’s the rare film that’s a perfect mix of comedy and suspense, all the while remaining an absolute blast.</p>\n<p>When his girlfriend invites him to meet her family, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, decides to go, knowing all too well the inevitable and uncomfortable topic of his skin tone. However, nothing could prepare him for what actually lies at the Armitage homestead. Surrounded by elitist, white, upper-class citizens, African-American servants and heavy doses of passive-aggressive racism, Chris can’t help but feel an overwhelming desire to, well, get out.</p>\n<p>Right out of the gate, “Get Out’’ opens with a perfect start that comfortably situates the audience into the unnerving, chuckled tone of the film. With its simple setup and seemingly basic plot, the film’s modest layout would normally signal a run-of-the-mill slasher film. But, as time passes, its structure and narrative become increasingly layered and complicated, proving that this movie is anything but your usual horror flick. There’s a clear crescendo as the film goes on, a rise that leads to both a maddening insanity and a worthwhile payoff. But this progression and escalation is so well-guided due to its intricate and layered plot that the film succeeds where less intelligent ones would fail. The film’s success lies in the fact that it uses this intelligent design for the purpose of entertainment. While sections of “Get Out” do address deeper and politically sensitive topics, the film never becomes a lecture on political awareness, nor does it ever forget its best quality: its ability to entertain with gripping humor and suspenseful horror.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Peele has absolutely coated and smothered the first half of the film with foreshadowing. Long after you’ve left the theater, these once-hidden details and premonitions will begin to click in your brain, allowing you to uncover aspects of the film you weren’t originally conscious of. This attention to detail makes “Get Out” the kind of movie you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. This technique is mostly found in Peele’s often tongue-in-cheek script. Dialogue is riddled with references and coded words that stand out like a sore thumb. In the paranoid setting, you begin to question even the smallest details. Nearly every line seems to have a hidden meaning, and by the end of the film, the script’s payoff is nearly mind-blowing. It’s jam-packed with so many hidden goodies that it would be nearly impossible to grab everything on the first go. “Get Out” definitely warrants multiple viewings.</p>\n<p>The same attention to detail can be found in the film’s sound design. While the score is a bit lackluster and often falls to the background, the sound design ends up by playing an integral role in both the narrative and the immersive nature of the film. Distinct sounds will begin to stand out and change meaning as the film goes on, playing into both the plot and the characters’ personalities. It sounds a bit complicated, but it works so seamlessly and on so many levels without much effort on behalf of the audience.</p>\n<p>These tricks and techniques transform “Get Out” into some kind of participatory mystery-thriller. It’s like the movie begs the audience to solve its puzzle. All the pieces are there for you to figure it out, you just need to pay attention to the detailed clues. And that’s part of what makes “Get Out” so much fun; its engagement of the audience. However, as much as you try to figure it all out, the film’s shocking twists will surprise even the most careful observer.</p>\n<p>The film also closely follows the protagonist, rarely showing us something that he hasn’t seen himself. It’s in this connection to Chris that the film relays most of its humor and suspense. The most horrifying moments are to be found when the camera lingers on a single shot, refusing to cut away. Like Chris, we are forced to helplessly watch as some terrifying force comes running straight toward us without any breaks. It’s a refreshing step away from the jump-scare. Taking advantage of its incredible sound design, this kind of experience also occurs in the much-advertised hypnosis scene in the film. I won’t give anything away, but I can tell you that it’s been a long time since I’ve felt that uncomfortable while watching a movie. The rhythmic and nerve-wracking sounds force you to experience Chris’s stress almost too well.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_76124\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1227778867\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76122\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76124\" data-attachment-id=\"76124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/film-title-get-out/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1586&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1586\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Film Title: Get Out\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=888%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76124\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2-250x194.jpg?resize=250%2C194\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=768%2C595&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>As a character, Chris’s calm demeanor can sometimes come off as a bit bland. But this reserved performance seems more intentional, displaying his ability to deal with the constant racism that’s thrown his way. He just isn’t fazed by it anymore, and his indifference is quite humorous. It also helps us to identify more with his character, as if we are vicariously experiencing his horror. While the other actors and actresses generally do a good job, there are some definite standouts. Lil Rel Howery, who plays Rod, is by far the comedic showstopper. His insight into the crazy events is hilarious and always brings the tone of the film back to comedy. But when it comes to horror, the scene-stealer here is the unnerving and troubled Georgina, played by Betty Gabriel. Her facial expressions and peeled-back smile are enough to make you shudder. Paired with close-up shots that are too much to look at and line delivery that is absolutely haunting, Georgina is sure to become a contemporary — and someday classic — movie “monster.”</p>\n<p>But as far as monsters go, there is no bigger villain here than racism. While this review won’t go too far into detail, it is worth mentioning how politically relevant most of the film is. As expressed above, the film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think about. Rarely does this become too overbearing, as the microaggression within the film ranges from clever and subtle to overly blatant and straight to uncomfortably hilarious.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most terrifying about Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is that its fictional world is only a small satirical step away from the one we live in. Aside from its relevant social critiques, the film stands foremost as an immensely fun and engaging feature. It’s nearly impossible to find anything wrong with “Get Out,” which explains its incredible success with the critics. I can’t think of a single person who wouldn’t have a fun time seeing this film. While it’s not the be-all-end-all Kubrick masterpiece that some people are claiming, it is, however, likely to be the most fun you will have at the movies for a very long time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/","id":5824,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5823,5822,5821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tracks of the Month: February 2017","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grown up Fairy Tales dates back to Acid Rap, originally for big brother Chance the Rapper himself, but Taylor Bennett takes it and features his brother as well as Jeremih.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future Islands – Ran</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baltimore alternative rock outfit, Future Islands, kick off their upcoming album with a warm and charming single punctuated with an emotionally-charged and eccentric vocal performance by frontman Samuel T.

Fresh off of performances at two of Southern California’s most popular music festivals, Camp Flog Gnaw and Coachella, the Los Angeles native graced Santa Barbara with a performance. He lived up to the hype that has followed him for the past few years.</p>\n<p>Washington burst onto the scene as a solo artist with his stellar major label debut The Epic, which received nearly universal critical acclaim. Nonetheless, the famously out of touch Grammy awards curiously snubbed him last year, leaving him without a nomination for Best Jazz Album. While he’s caught the ear of most major and reputable music blogs, Washington also caught the eye of some of the most boundary-pushing artists in funk, jazz and rap.</p>\n<p>You may have heard his saxophone work on fellow Los Angeles native Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly (which is perhaps the best rap album of the past decade). Washington also has worked with label-mate and bassist Thundercat, and he’s fresh off of a collaboration with my own personal favorite group, Run the Jewels. These fantastic artists have collaborated with Washington because he’s doing something new and different with the classic styles of jazz while continuing to pay homage to its roots.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>These great artists weren’t the only ones to recognize Washington’s talents, as it was clear that Washington’s recent critical success had gotten around to both locals and UCSB students. The show was sold out long before the day of the event, and the night of, the crowd even eagerly greeted Washington with a standing ovation. The bandleader, clad in blue robes, graced the stage and was joined by his band The Next Step, who were able to hold their own next to Washington himself. It was a great night of incredible music and energy, as the crowd was one of the liveliest I’ve seen inside of Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, the band played a good mix of improvised songs and tracks from their setlist. One of the highlights was the song “Henrietta Our Hero,” an eight-minute musical and emotional journey from The Epic that Washington explained was a tribute to his grandmother. Nia Andrews contributed her beautiful vocals to the track in what was her first show with the whole band according to Washington. A third-year UCSB student and huge Washington fan, enjoyed how Washington “was able to run across the whole spectrum of emotion on the sax.” This was especially evident in songs where the sweet choruses gave way to loud, powerful saxophone solos from Washington.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75908\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"7660569\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75907\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75908\" data-attachment-id=\"75908\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/24kamasi1-articlelarge-v3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?fit=1756%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1756,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?fit=214%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?fit=878%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75908\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3-214x250.jpg?resize=214%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?resize=214%2C250&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?resize=768%2C896&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?resize=878%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 878w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24kamasi1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?w=1756&amp;ssl=1 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75908\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of National Jazz Museum in Harlem</p></div>\n<p>Washington’s father also joined the show halfway through, playing flute and clarinet. It was great to see because it was clear that he was incredibly proud to be playing alongside his son. The biggest musical highpoint, however, may have been a moment between only two members of the band, drummers Robert Miller and Tony Austin. Washington introduced this part of the show as a conversation between the drummers, who both had full drum sets, as they improvised rhythms with each other and traded ideas for solos back and forth. The way that they were able to listen, communicate and share through only playing music was astounding.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest highlight, however, was not musical at all but came in between the songs. During onstage banter, Washington would explain how he met the different members of the band, most of whom he met during high school or even before. Each story showed the bond they had as musicians and showed how their ability to grow musically was cultivated over many years. One of the funnier anecdotes was when he described his first time meeting trombonist Ryan Porter at a band camp when they were only pre-teens. Porter’s trombone playing was so soulful that Washington was sure he had the problems of an old man.</p>\n<p>Porter responded that he could play the trombone that way because he woke up and had no milk for his cereal that morning and he drew on that to play. These anecdotes really added to the show and let Washington’s charisma and loveable personality shine through. Another third-year UCSB student said after the show, “I loved how you could see Kamasi Washington’s bond with everyone in the group.” This is something that cannot be witnessed from a recording. Deep bonds formed through trust, friendship and family make better jazz than anything that the most talented strangers could create.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/kamasi-washington-is-a-jazz-legend-in-the-making/","id":6792,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6791,6790,6789],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Postmodern Jukebox Brings Charm to Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage lit up with a flaming, passionate red, and the musicians of Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) took the stage in their first-ever show in Santa Barbara.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As I passed under the brightly blinking marquee lights and entered the Arlington Theatre, it was as if I had gone back in time. The courtyard was bustling, and everywhere I looked couples were decked out in their snazziest vintage attire. Elaborate hats with feathers or lace poked out above the crowd while brightly colored suits and long skirts formed a vibrant sea of fabric. The atmosphere was festive and fun as couples and friends alike took their seats and prepared for a swinging Valentine’s Day throwback experience.</p>\n<p>The stage lit up with a flaming, passionate red, and the musicians of Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) took the stage in their first ever show in Santa Barbara. The group was formed by Scott Bradlee in 2011 and became a YouTube sensation with jazz and swing covers of famous contemporary songs. After their albums and videos became widespread hits, they began touring with various musicians, singers and dancers while keeping true to the origins of their music.</p>\n<p>During the show, Bradlee told the audience, “A lot of you have followed us from the old days when I was recording videos in my basement … so this was always a grassroots thing. Thanks to you and your shares and views, PMJ has now toured four continents.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The show’s emcee, Mario Jose, hyped the crowd up with a loud, bright voice and some old fashioned jokes before the first number.<br>\nWith a suave tone, he announced, “We’re taking you on a journey back in time tonight, when social media actually meant shaking hands with someone and swiping tinder was something you did by the fireplace in the winter.”</p>\n<p>As the crowd laughed with him, a jazzy rendition of “Call Me Maybe” began to play, adding to the lighthearted mood. The arrangement was reminiscent of 1920s New Orleans swing with heavy banjo and a quick beat. Robyn Adele Anderson performed the song with a soaring belt and a sparkling flapper dress to match the time period.</p>\n<p>Dani Armstrong dominated the stage next with a vibrant red dress and unwavering confidence as she sauntered to the microphone. Her rendition of Britney Spears’s “Toxic” was sultry and captivating, with a slow, pounding beat and an intense mixture of loud and soft moments. The red-headed singer hit sky high notes that filled the theatre with a vintage-style vibrato. The slight raspy quality of her voice on the low notes and occasional grinding vocals completed the seductive tone of the song.</p>\n<p>Jose said it best when after Armstrong’s performance, he commented, “Anyone else need a smoke after that?”</p>\n<p>In the style of old fashioned floorshows, Casey Abrams introduced himself with flair by theatrically balancing his guitar on his hand, feigning like he was going to drop it with a wide-eyed expression. At one point, just to ham it up even more, he pulled out a bottle and took a sip, all while maintaining his balance. His dazzling talent did not stop there, however, as his vocal performances exuded fun and spontaneity. His bluesy cover of “Sweet Child O’ Mine” demonstrated his strong, raspy voice, and his interaction with the other musicians kept the audience laughing and cheering. He even engaged in a vocal battle with trombone player James Hall; Abrams scatted a musical phrase and Hall mimicked him with blasts from the trombone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75910\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983708497\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75909\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75910\" data-attachment-id=\"75910\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/pmj-promo-2-12-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=2048%2C1337&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1337\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"PMJ PROMO 2-12-14\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=888%2C580&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75910\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14-250x163.jpg?resize=250%2C163\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=768%2C501&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harbison Theater</p></div>\n<p>One musical battle was not enough for this show, however, as tap dancer Anise Aliah faced off against drummer Martin Dillard. The dancer’s vibrant energy shone as she kept her wide smile even through the most complex of steps. This wasn’t enough for Dillard, however, as he stopped the upbeat music and began to copy Aliah’s rhythm with his drumsticks, flipping them in the air and catching them with style. Each performer took turns attempting to best each other with impossibly fast beats. Aliah clearly won the crowd, however, as her fast turns, high kicks and relentless wing steps drove the audience wild with applause.</p>\n<p>The evening was a true homage to the days of variety shows and spectacles of performance with one audience-grabbing, fun-loving segment after another. The musicians, dancers and vocalists captured the essence of classic jazz with spontaneity, smoothness and constant collaboration with their fellow performers. The show was meant for Valentine’s Day, as it demonstrated both the group’s and audience’s love of jazz and the swanky style of earlier times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/","id":6711,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6710,6709,6708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lucidity Fest Coming to SB this Spring","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Winter-Creative-Lucidity-Festival-2015-April-11th-Saturday-0100-900x600.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Winter-Creative-Lucidity-Festival-2015-April-11th-Saturday-0100-900x600.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Get ready, Santa Barbara, because in a little over six weeks from now, April 7-9, the Lucidity Festival will return to our very own Live Oak Campground for its sixth and final gathering. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Get ready, Santa Barbara, because in a little over six weeks from now, April 7-9, the Lucidity Festival will return to our very own Live Oak Campground for its sixth and final gathering. This year, an estimated 5,000 enthusiastic participants will gather in the Santa Ynez Hills for the festival’s ultimate “Eudaimonia” incarnation.</p>\n<p>Eudaimonia is a Greek word meaning “happiness rooted in virtue,” as described by festival co-founder Jonah Haas. In order to elaborate on the meaning of his words, Haas delved into the history of the Lucidity festival and its unique structure. Lucidity is part of a particular subset of large-scale festivals known as transformational festivals. Coined by Jeet-Kei Leung at a TEDTalk in 2011, the term refers “to events that [are] participatory, interactive, immersive and collaborative, integrating educational workshops, healing arts, music and dance and an inclusive approach to culture and spirituality.”</p>\n<p>Further distinguishing Lucidity from the already narrow group of transformational festivals such as Burning Man or Lightning in a Bottle is its unique six-year story arc. Throughout Lucidity’s previous five lives, the gathering has woven a tale of what Haas calls, “personal and collective transformation, inspired by Joseph Campbell’s concept of the Hero’s Journey.” Haas and the rest of the festival’s family of co-owners released their collective brainchild upon the world back in 2012, and it has seen healthy annual growth in each succeeding year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In addition to the three day weekend already packed with a killer music lineup featuring the likes of Ott, Delhi 2 Dublin, Dirtwire and Dirtybird Records’ Christian Martin, this year will feature a full week of six educational courses. The diverse set of topics includes Ayurvedic herbalism, designing and building with bamboo, creating your own personal mythology and dream council.</p>\n<p>The courses are part of a movement within the Lucidity Festival called Lucid University. The University started at Lucidity two years ago, growing from one course on permaculture to last year’s five-course catalogue to the veritable cornucopia of knowledge we have before us today. When asked which course he was most excited for, Haas responded: “I’m most excited about the building and designing with bamboo class. It will be led by world [renowned] bamboo artist and architect Gerard Minikawa of Bamboo DNA.” Lucid University will soon become a year-round institution at Trillium in southern Oregon, and its goal is to foster a lifelong journey of learning and discovery within its participants; a lofty goal, but one that somehow seems possible within the magical folds of the Santa Ynez Hills.</p>\n<p>The annual gathering features music, art, culture and so much more. From diverse, healthy and ethical food to massive themed villages to comprehensive and intriguing workshops, the festival seems to breathe with a certain life energy throughout each facet of its being. Among the event’s seven village themes are “Warriors Way,” offering workshops on self-defense and survival skills, a “Healing Sanctuary” featuring various holistic medicinal practices and the warm and snuggly “Lovers’ Nest,” which looks to be a setup for a gigantic cuddle puddle. There is also an outlet for kids at Lucidity in the “Family Garden,” in which children can experience the festival through structured workshops, playshops, art, music and food exhibitions. This April, thousands of curious souls will wander to a massive joining of spirits and of communal energy right here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Haas describes it as “a heart opening experience” and “an opportunity to play, to grow and to dream.” When reflecting upon the events of the past few months, our current political landscape has proven taxing on the psyches of many of us here in Santa Barbara, and a rejuvenating experience like Lucidity could do us all a spot of good. For some, this massive festival may just be the next big party, for others it could be “the nurturing communal experience they’ve been yearning for” and for others still the path to their truly actualized self may lie within Lucidity’s oak-shrouded borders. Only those who venture to Live Oak Campground this April will know for sure.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/","id":6538,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6537,6536,6535],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":22,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
