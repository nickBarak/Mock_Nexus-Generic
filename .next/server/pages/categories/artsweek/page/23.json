Wang, whom the San Francisco Chronicle called “the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today,” alongside Kavakos, whose violin talents recently secured him the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, performed pieces by Janácek, Schubert, Debussy and Bartok as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series.</p>\n<p>Wang took to the stage in a resplendent glow, sporting four-inch stilettos and a tight, elegant dress that looked as if it were made of nothing but smoke and gold leaf. She has built up quite the reputation for stylish-yet-risqué outfits that allegedly get under some critics’ skin but simply lead me to think of her as the Rihanna of the concert piano world.  Kavakos, in sharp contrast, emerged solemn and subdued in a button-down and slacks. He would have fit just as well in a Silicon Valley startup office as on the stage, and this contrast foreshadowed the dynamic and complex ways the duo’s musical styles would interact throughout the night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75764\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"37285325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75763\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75764\" data-attachment-id=\"75764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/yuja-wang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Yuja Wang\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of PBS&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75764\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of PBS</p></div>\n<p>A violin sonata by Janácek started off the night, the technical difficulty of the piece immediately casting light on both Kavakos’s and Wang’s brute-force musical talent. However, the two seemed a bit tense during the first couple movements, and this rigidity meshed poorly with the already dissonant nature of Janácek’s piece. Luckily, by the third and fourth movements, they had settled into their respective grooves for the sonata’s triumphant yet melancholy climax.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Schubert’s “Fantasie in C Minor” followed, providing a welcome reprieve from the tension of the previous piece. The audience’s hopes soared alongside Kavakos’s nimble bow as he weaved a verdant tapestry of sound and light in the Granada’s expanse. Wang’s nimble fingers supplied the backdrop to the magical expanse, the Middle Earth to Kavakos’s quest for the ring, as it were. Afterward there was a short intermission, at which I overheard one patron remarking that, “this theater is run by a bunch of extortionists, I mean can you believe it, $9 for a glass of unremarkable chardonnay? They’re just playing off of people’s insecurities about talking to strangers at intermissions, like of course we’re going to get a drink, what choice do we have?” The disgruntled man wished to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p>The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress. She must have transmuted some of her visual pizazz into musical zeal, as her performance on Debussy’s “Sonata in G Minor” elicited gasps and murmurs from the audience. As she squeezed every last drop of emotion from the Steinway’s lower register, I was shaken by vibrations in my liver itself. Or maybe another organ close to the liver.</p>\n<p>Kavakos and Wang polished off the night with Bartok’s “Sonata No.1 in C# Minor,” a piece that would no doubt make any but the most accomplished of performers quake in their loafers. This sonic rollercoaster bore some resemblance to the Janácek piece from earlier in the night, but where the former felt constricted and claustrophobic, the duo’s nightcap exploded in a cacophony of unrestrained chaos and energy. Drowsing patrons could be seen jerking upright in their seats at the stab of a minor chord or the wail of Kavakos’s strings. The intensity continued to build and build before releasing itself in ecstatic, frenetic climax leaving both performers and audience awake, gasping and perhaps a little sweaty. At one point, I began to suspect that Yuja Wang doesn’t have hands at all, and instead performs with a pair of motion-blurs on the ends of her arms like electrons whipping around inside valence shells. Although it’s not their first performance on the Arts &amp; Lectures circuit, it’s safe to say that Wang and Kavakos will not soon be forgotten by the Santa Barbara concert scene.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/","id":6709,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6708,6707,6706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Grammys Pay Tribute to Past and Present","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=900%2C506&ssl=1","description":"No matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2017 Grammy Awards were a glimpse back at legends lost and a look forward to the young artists ready to dominate the music scene in years to come.</p>\n<p>Bruno Mars played Prince’s twin, paying tribute to the king of funk.

Vulnerable, she stopped short after opening with “Fastlove” in her tribute to the esteemed pop icon. She asked to “restart” the song from the top saying, “I can’t mess this up for him.” She shares an emotional connection to Michael because of their mutual London roots. It was quite a night for the pop songstress herself. The powerhouse singer simply dominated, bringing home five Grammys for her third studio album, 25, in the show’s most sought-after categories: Song, Record and Album of the Year. The British songstress performed “Hello” in a geometric red and black dress with an accordion skirt, channeling her classic look with a new twist.  The nostalgia in the room was uncanny, with the singer gushing, “The last time I was here was five years ago, and I was pregnant … I lost a lot of myself being a mother … it seems like I’ve gone full circle.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout her five wins, Adele decided to share her successes with an idol of hers, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>“I adore you, and I want you to be my mommy,” she exclaimed to Queen Bey. “The Lemonade album was so monumental … We got to see another side of you … We, as artists, adore you … You are our light.” Beyoncé stopped the show with her breathtaking performance centered around her latest studio album, Lemonade. Although she chose to perform less popular tracks, including “Love Drought,” and “Sandcastles,” she successfully won over the crowd. Even while pregnant with twins, she still owned it. Bey’s royalty radiated through her goddess-like costume.</p>\n<p>The messages she instilled in us will stay: “Your mother is a woman, and women like her cannot be contained.” Queen Bey’s performance will go down in Grammys history.</p>\n<p>Although there was no specific tribute dedicated to David Bowie, he won Best Rock Song with “Blackstar,” the title track from his 25th and final studio album, which was released on his 69th birthday.</p>\n<p>Best New Artist recipient Chance the Rapper also took the night by storm.</p>\n<p>“I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” he exclaimed. “I know that people think independence means you do things by yourself, but independence means freedom.”</p>\n<p>He referenced SoundCloud and “all the independent artists out there” throughout his speech and encouraged the audience to continue in their endeavors, big or small. Chance started as an independent artist himself with his first mixtape, 10 Day, and since then, he has made significant strides in the music world, winning his first Grammy with Coloring Book. His success shows that no matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75760\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"859788678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75756\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75760\" data-attachment-id=\"75760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75760\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p>After taking a break from the public since her father’s death in 2009, Paris Jackson finally made an appearance, presenting The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The trio began with a medley of “Starboy” that led into “I Feel It Coming.” The collaboration gave rise to an unusual yet intriguing set that channeled Hoth from “Star Wars.”</p>\n<p>New York DJ duo Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, also known as the Chainsmokers, rocked the charts this past year. Tracks such as “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer” and “Roses” blasted through speakers on repeat, whether at a raging party, the gym or car radios. It’s no wonder that they won their first ever Grammy Award this year alongside Daya. Although Rihanna turned them down to be featured in the Grammy winning single, “Don’t Let Me Down,” they still seemed to reach success in the viral department.</p>\n<p>Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots were definitely not “stressed out” about receiving their award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” in nothing but their underpants.</p>\n<p>“Josh turned to me … and he said, ‘If we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this,’” Joseph said.</p>\n<p>Ed Sheeran was loving our bodies, and we are loving his Grammy performance right back. Although he was a last-minute addition to the set list, he did not disappoint. Sheeran centered his performance around his latest single, “Shape of You.” He decided to play it casual and performed the song with nothing more than his acoustic guitar. His manner seemed like he was performing for a few of his closest friends, yet millions were watching all over the world. His all-black outfit — including a “HOAX” T-shirt, black jeans and kicks — contributed to the affinity of his performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native Katy Perry took the stage with a new and improved look. With short blonde locks that frame her face and a new wardrobe, she surprised the audience as platinum Perry. She really was trapped in her “white picket fence” as she took the stage on a set emulating her opening line to her new hit single, “Chained To The Rhythm.” Perry came barreling out in a white, black-lined pantsuit and John Lennon-esque rose-colored glasses and white sneakers. She walked through blue and white clouds and turned the corner to find Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican legend Bob Marley. The younger Marley channeled his grandfather’s eclectic reggae sound and wore a white army jacket and pants. Perry topped her performance off with an iconic “We the People” backdrop.</p>\n<p>In a night with no shortage of political statements, Donald Trump was criticized by a number of performers. Neil Portnow, record producer and president of the Recording Academy, took a different approach, calling out to Washington to keep American music alive.</p>\n<p>After quoting John F. Kennedy, he remarked, “The Recording Academy together with the music-makers call on the President and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.” Portnow concluded, “We have a collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique,  economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/","id":6710,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6709,6708,6707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Process by Sampha","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1bb558bcd5.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1bb558bcd5.png?resize=886%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sampha has been featured in tracks by Kanye, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Drake, yet hadn’t released a full debut album of his own until this week’s Process. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although you may not recognize his name, Sampha is a voice you’ve likely heard before. The singer, songwriter and producer from South London has had his hands in many of the best R&amp;B, neo soul and electronic records of the past few years. He co-produced four songs on Pitchfork’s top album of 2016, Solange’s spectacular record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and lends his vocals to one of the top singles from that album, “Don’t Touch My Hair.” He’s worked heavily with British DJ and Young Turks label-mate SBTRKT. He’s been featured in tracks by Kanye, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Drake, yet hadn’t released a full debut album of his own until this week’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When a new artist like Sampha gains the respect of so many talented and influential musicians before they’ve even put out a debut album, it’s good to pay attention to their solo work ,and I’m glad I did with his new project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sampha states in the heartfelt ballad about his childhood, “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” he has “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something some people call a soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” His vocals aren’t perfect and clean, but they carry tremendous emotion. His voice is like a beautiful, passionate mixture of James Blake, Frank Ocean and Leon Bridges, and he’s already learned how to compliment it well with the instrumentation on his debut LP. On “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” one of the lead singles of the project which Sampha dedicates to his mother, he strips back the instrumentation and creates an amazing back-and-forth between himself and the piano that make you believe him when he says, “No one knows me like the piano in my mother’s home.” The listener can feel the true demand he feels for self-expression. That amount of soulfulness is special, and Sampha has it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hear that soulfulness again when he sings of the ways he blamed a past lover for his own underlying problems in “Reverse Faults,” using the metaphor of taking the breaks out of his own car, getting into an accident and blaming the other person in the relationship even though it was his own doing. You hear it when in “Timmy’s Prayer,” perhaps singing about this same ex, he laments that, “I got thrown out / I don’t know which way to go now / Don’t know which way is home now.” Not only is his vocal delivery powerful, but Sampha also does an incredible job of painting a picture with his lyrics. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His lyrical imagery is most notable on what is perhaps the best song on the album, “Blood on Me.” The most upbeat and exciting track on the record, “Blood on Me” features evocative images of a tortured dreamscape where Sampha is running away from his inner demons and fears. Throughout the track, the singer is out of breath and the repetition of the intro throughout the runtime of the song creates a dreadful, anxious chase scene in the listener’s mind. He has said in an interview with Genius that this track came about from improvising on the piano after watching the critically-acclaimed anime film</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ghost in the Shell</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the influence is obvious, as the emotion of a cold world filled with enemies around every corner really comes across in the delivery of this track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might lob the same criticisms on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that many initially did on Solange’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which Sampha worked heavily on. They might say that it’s too low-key, especially within the deeper cuts of the record. However, his style of electronic-infused soul is not as laid back as it would first seem and has a lot of depth to it that rewards multiple listens, especially once you dig deeper into lyrics. Not every single song is a complete hit, but that’s to be expected with a debut record. Still, every song on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showcases the unique artistry Sampha brings to the table. In the end, what we are left with is one of the best soul debuts of the past few years and perhaps the best album of the year so far.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/","id":6708,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6707,6706,6705],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Six Songs About Girls: A Valentine’s Day Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2013-05-27-AmyOhAmy.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2013-05-27-AmyOhAmy.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sugar, spice and everything nice.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sugar, spice and everything nice. Most of us have known this rhyme since the days of being chased by girls on the playground, sweet trails of bubblegum and candy floss left in their wake.

After an eight-year hiatus from filmmaking, he made “Moonlight”, a film about a Miami teen struggling with issues of family and sexuality. Its success made Jenkins the first African-American to earn Oscar nominations for directing, writing, and best picture. It premiered, fittingly enough, at Telluride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was cool as hell,” Jenkins said, grinning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film, he said, had much personal significance to him and the man who wrote the play on which it was based, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both of them had cocaine-addicted mothers, and Naomie Harris plays one in the film. Jenkins had to hold his ears backstage so he wouldn’t hear the clip featuring her, the memories still fresh in his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenneth Lonergan, writer and director of “Manchester by the Sea”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed Jenkins. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was able to briefly converse with him:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung: Why was the setting of Manchester so important to the film and to Lee?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonergan:  I guess because of the way the script developed. It started out as an arbitrary choice, and then I did a lot of research on the town. I think just all the elements of the environment of a story can be really important part of it.  If you think of movies like “The Last Picture Show” or “Hell or High Water,” for instance, and “Moonlight” … you don’t want “Moonlight” to be anywhere but Miami, and it really couldn’t be, in a way. It’s a little hard to say why.

The role of the emotionally detached protagonist Lee Chandler ended up going to Casey Affleck, earning him an Oscar nod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s just incredible,” Lonergan praised him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primarily a writer, Lonergan has been practicing his craft since the fifth grade.

Did those conversations influence how you two cooperated on making “Arrival?”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve: Yeah, definitely. I spent a lot of time, a lot of coffees with Eric in order to develop the screenplay. I mean, it came with a very strong first draft, and my job as a director is to guide the screenwriter, to move forward, to shape the movie to the way I would love it to be. So, yes, definitely. A lot of conversations helped a lot in building the world we were dreaming of. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve, known for directing dramas like “Prisoners” and “Sicario,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said it’s been a long-time ambition to make a sci-fi film, having been influenced by comic books, Steven Spielberg and Alejandro Jodorowsky (who also took a crack at making “Dune,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which Villeneuve is signed on to direct). The problem with modern sci-fi films, Villeneuve said, is that they have a “lack of freshness” on account of being more about the technology than the ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “Arrival”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself, Villeneuve said, “Amy [Adams] was my muse.  She was my first choice,” and, “For me, the movie was about this woman’s journey and her revelation about death.” One thing he tried very hard to avoid was crafting the film in a way that information would be spoon-fed to the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening capped off with (as is SBIFF tradition) all five directors taking the stage to discuss their early cinematic influences with Hammond, with answers ranging from “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Disney</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then “Risky Business”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">director Paul Brickman took the stage to praise his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were two common threads [of tonight’s films]: a strong emotional center and, in this corporate world of ours, these were fiercely personal visions. It gives me a lot of hope,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noting that members of the Directors Guild of America had considerably short lifespans, he quipped, “Let’s get these awards out while they’re still healthy,” and the five thus received their very pointy gold trophies from volunteers before standing up for a final round of photos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/","id":5830,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5829,5828,5827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF’s Virtuosos Awards Celebrate Diversity","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/virtuosos-500x333.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/virtuosos-500x333.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1","description":"This year’s Virtuosos Awards ensemble dared to defy the divisions that are often employed within Hollywood and created compelling performances that enticed audiences across countless screens. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Virtuosos Award ceremony was held in the Arlington Theatre on Feb. 6 at the height of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The eight honorees of the night included Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”), Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Janelle Monáe (“Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures”), Ruth Negga (“Loving”), Stephen Henderson (“Fences”), Simon Helberg (“Florence Foster Jenkins”),  Aaron Taylor-Johnson (“Nocturnal Animals”) and Dev Patel (“Lion”). The Virtuoso Award is a recognition for the breakthrough actors who gave a riveting performance in a film released the previous year.</p>\n<p>The moderator of the night, Dave Karger, acknowledged that six of the actors given the award were people of color (Patel, Henderson, Harris, Ali, Negga and Monae). Despite sentiments of despair that can arise when considering diversity in today’s landscape, the world of film has begun widening its spectrum of inclusion. All of the actors honored with a Virtuosos Award this year brought three-dimensional characters to life with storylines that didn’t submit them into clichéd molds.</p>\n<p>Mahershala Ali was the first recipient of the night, receiving the award for his utterly breathtaking role as Juan, a drug dealer in “Moonlight.” Karger spoke of Ali’s ability to channel dynamic vulnerability into a man who dealt with drugs. Ali drew from personal experiences about the region where he grew up, pointing out that most drug dealers in the area did not embody their exaggerated stereotypes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Most of them never grew up wanting to be drug dealers; they did it because that was the only way they could survive,” Ali said. In regard to the condemnation of his religion in the media, Ali eloquently stated, “The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, but the vast majority of media coverage of Muslims is of those who are not.”</p>\n<p>When given the question if he would ever want to pursue making romantic films, Ali responded with “I want to do everything. I want to tell a joke or two, as well. I want to do a comedy or action movie. I’ve done a lot of television, but for now I want to explore more theater and film.”</p>\n<p>As for Ali’s “Moonlight” costar, Naomie Harris, she was hesitant in taking on the role of the drug-addicted Paula, as she thought it would only perpetuate negative stigmas, but ultimately decided to take on the role when she saw the vivid complexities and earnest nature in director Barry Jenkins’s script. Harris is the only actor in “Moonlight” that appears in all three chapters, and the astounding element is that she filmed all of her scenes in just three days. She had to deal with portraying a woman who descends into a desperation of drug dependency. To prepare for the role, Harris had to venture into the depths of YouTube to research drug addicts, as she herself doesn’t consume caffeine, alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p>With the vast collection of serious roles in these movies, Simon Helberg’s role in “Florence Foster Jenkins” alongside Meryl Streep sheds a comedic light on this year’s Virtuosos Awards.</p>\n<p>When the clip of his performance from “Florence Foster Jenkins” was displayed on screen, the crowd was erupting into fits of laughter when they witnessed Helberg’s facial expressions in the scene reacting to Streep’s singing. Helberg had to undergo preparation to freshen up his piano skills to further delve into the role of the pianist, Cosmé McMoon.</p>\n<p>When asked about what it was like working alongside Streep, Helberg said it was “much like a fever dream” and made a knock at the recent comments made about Streep from the President, joking, “She’s very powerful, if not overrated.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Henderson is a newcomer in the framework of film yet a seasoned veteran in the theater component of acting. Henderson played the same role he plays in Denzel Washington’s film adaptation of the August Wilson screenplay, “Fences,” on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p>On his lifelong dream of working with Washington, Henderson mused, “If you wait for the train, it’s always going to come to the station.”</p>\n<p>As a surprise to the audience, Janelle Monáe stated that she actually studied drama in college before dedicating her time to music. Her role as Juan’s girlfriend, Teresa, in “Moonlight” marked her film debut and catapulted her into the realms of the Golden Globes and the Oscars.</p>\n<p>Regarding her role, Monáe said, “I wanted to fill a void for the character of Chiron that his mother couldn’t fill because she wasn’t capable due to her drug addiction. It was a reminder to him that he does matter and that he shouldn’t ever think for a moment that he was not worthy of love.”</p>\n<p>Ruth Negga, an Ethiopian-Irish actress, was being presented the Virtuosos Award for her performance in “Loving,” a story of an interracial marriage during the time of segregation. She finalized her interview with Karger about her Oscar-nominated portrayal as Mildred Loving with the compelling message that, “This isn’t just a black story, and it isn’t just an American story.” She added, “It’s my story, and it’s the world’s story.”</p>\n<p>Dev Patel has the charismatic qualities of a Disney prince, and his phenomenal role as Saroo in “Lion” only adds to his charm.</p>\n<p>Patel’s first scene when filming “Lion” was the ending reunion scene, and he expressed that he “spent eight months of sleepless nights on thinking about making this scene perfect.” Patel recounts his portrayal as Saroo as a “process of introspection; I spent a lot of time isolated, traveling on trains in India. I had to write a diary, which I’ve never done before; that makes you confront somethings inside yourself.”</p>\n<p>As the last actor to accept an award, Aaron Taylor-Johnson talked about his sadistic portrayal of the killer Ray in “Nocturnal Animals.” Johnson showed hesitance of taking on this role as he felt it would bring an excessively dark aura into his household, where he is surrounded by his daughters and wife. Due to the gruesome nature of his character, Johnson had to do exhaustive research on serial killers three months prior to the making of the film. While on this intensive diet of serial killer documentaries, Johnson learned that what he had to emulate from these killers into his inherently violent character, Ray, was their dimensions of “charm and charisma.”<br>\nIn regard to starting the production of “Nocturnal Animals,” Johnson said, “I started to have sleepless nights, both from the things I was watching and the anxiety that came from provoking Jake Gyllenhaal’s character.”</p>\n<p>Karger wrapped up the night by asking a final open-ended question to the panel of actors: “What are three dreams that you want to fulfill?” Negga stated that she wants to work with the influential director Spike Lee; Ali would like to someday portray Jack Johnson or the Motown singer-songwriter Marvin Gaye; Monae would like a legacy “Star Wars” movie and to see more predominantly female and minorities in film; Taylor-Johnson would love to work in another one of his wife’s films. This year’s Virtuosos Awards ensemble dared to defy the divisions that are often employed within Hollywood and created compelling performances that enticed audiences across countless screens.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/","id":5823,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5822,5821,5820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Moonlit Evening with the Stars of ‘La La Land’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.

Hundreds of fans screaming in unison heralded their arrival at the Arlington Theatre as they stepped out of their midnight-black cars. The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.</p>\n<p>After the picture-palace had filled every seat, Board President Lynda Weinman emerged to thank the show’s sponsors and drew attention to how SBIFF is, unlike many other festivals, primarily educational. Then she introduced the show’s veteran moderator for the evening, Roger Durling, who hailed the night’s guests as “intelligent and amiable” and “an average-looking sex-symbol.” Whomever he was referring to is up to you.</p>\n<p>Then the lights dimmed and a montage of the two performers’ roles played onscreen to the tune of the film’s opening song, “Another Day of Sun,” played live on a century-old organ. After it sank beneath the floor, Gosling and Stone walked onstage to a standing ovation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It did not take either of them long to charm the already won-over audience, with a stoic Gosling dryly noting that the photographers camping out in front of the stage were shooting his every twitch. Stone, meanwhile, jokingly referred to Gosling as “Rysies” and announced her goal to make Durling snort as much as possible for the night’s duration. If only she could hear the man in the audience whose laughs sounded like a duck’s mating call.</p>\n<p>Their careers were reviewed through clips and Durling’s commentary: Gosling rose to dramatic prominence as a Jewish Nazi in Henry Bean’s “The Believer,” despite Bean’s skepticism over the role going to a “Mickey Mouse Club” alumnus. Stone dropped out of high school at 15 to act and, like her “La La Land” character, spent months auditioning without success. She eventually came to win the hearts of her fans in “Superbad” and “Zombieland.”The two first appeared alongside each other in “Crazy, Stupid, Love” and established a rapport after improvising together during their audition.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75548\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"465873950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75543\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75548\" data-attachment-id=\"75548\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/la-la-land-by-jenny-luo-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"La La Land by Jenny Luo-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75548 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gosling wound up getting involved with “La La Land” when he recognized Chazelle in a restaurant and approached him.

Gosling stares, almost forlornly, at the floor.</p>\n<p>“You too, Ryan!” Both actors burst out laughing with the crowd.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Chazelle came onstage to mark the night’s end. As dozens of flashing camera lights attempted to blind him, he told his stars, “I do believe you two are some of the best actors working today,” and he called their participation in his film “a dream [he thought] would never come true.”</p>\n<p>Gosling and Stone happily accepted their awards, then used the rapier-like ends of the golden statues to duel onstage.  “You could do some real damage with this,” Gosling joked.</p>\n<p>After the show, they exited through the back of the Arlington into awaiting long, black, glamorous Chevrolets. Fans eager to get a closer glimpse or even a photo stood behind metal barriers being carefully monitored by security guards. Gosling emerged to renewed squeals with Stone following right behind. After taking a brief minute to interact with their belated fans, they left in their dark chariots to (most likely) return to the sun-kissed lands of La La.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/","id":5821,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5820,5819,5818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: CULTURE by Migos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=942%2C336&ssl=1","description":"The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Atlanta’s Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, who make up the trio known as Migos, have always made music that is more than just <i>music</i>. They breathe the voice of hip hop’s most vibrant city, they craft anthems for a young and energetic generation and they drop some of the filthiest bangers on the face of this planet. Simply put, it’s more than music. It’s culture.</p>\n<p>Many Migos mixtapes and albums have come and gone, but the hip hop community, internet and culture were especially buzzing for this one. The group had been lurking in the background after the overdone and frankly overrated “Pipe It Up,”and with the dab trend having died out, many dismissed the group as superficial gimmick rappers. But everything changed in October with the single “Bad and Boujee.”</p>\n<p>“Bad and Boujee,” as Donald Glover pointed out in his Golden Globes name-check of the track, is extremely important — for Migos, hip hop and all of us. “Bad and Boujee” showed the world not only that Migos are back stronger than ever, but also that they are making much more than gimmick hits. This song is the thesis statement, manifesto and earth-shattering proclamation of <i>CULTURE</i>, the album and the construct. The infectious bounce of this hit is why the hype is so present around this album, and upon the first listen, this hype is absolutely warranted.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens up with the title track, “Culture.” Featuring DJ Khaled, this song utilizes the most appropriate hypeman possible because, whether you like him or not, Khaled has established himself as a cultural icon over the last year. The next few tracks keep the album’s opening extremely high energy, as heavy-hitting singles “T-Shirt,” “Call Casting” and “Bad and Boujee” follow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the album, which features entirely new material, is extremely consistent with strong production, smooth southern flow and a few well-placed features. Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Travis Scott, who all mesh perfectly with Migos, have standout roles. “Kelly Price,” featuring Travis Scott, particularly shows the group’s versatility as they weave in and out of a downtempo beat with melodic verses. This album’s strength lies in the ability to go in on a harder beat and contrarily sing well on a slower one. Other highlights include the head nodder “Get Right Witcha,” and a Zaytoven-produced piano banger called “Big On Big.” The contrasts between each track are noticeable and keep the listener engaged throughout the album. The only noticeable flaw is the drawn-out length of some of the songs.</p>\n<p><i>CULTURE</i> is extremely important for the careers of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, as it is the most seriously they have been taken and is the first true album from the group that will be listened to as such. After early breakout hits like the Drake-remixed “Versace” and club favorite “Hannah Montana,” Migos were all about internet presence. They made hot singles that were played for fun at parties, often memed on the internet, and nothing more. However, after signing onto Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label and this release of a cohesive and consistent album on the coattails of “Bad and Boujee,” Migos are finally serious hip hop contenders.</p>\n<p>The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. Upon listening to this album, it is extremely apparent that their approach has changed from a hit-making formula to something both enigmatic and fluid. Quavo, Offset and Takeoff have used Atlanta to create music that is not for profit appeal but for the appeal of themselves, their roots, their experience and their audience. Migos have started a dialogue with their audience that we must engage in — for ourselves, for the music, for each other, for the culture.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/","id":6707,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6706,6705,6704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sango & Monte Booker Bringing the Sound of Tomorrow to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12-elg.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12-elg.jpg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1","description":"On Sunday, Feb. 4, SOhO is lucky to host a pair of innovative young beatmakers for a night of squeaky-clean polished mixes and cuts.

Headlining the night is rising star Sango, whose music, like much of the genre-agnostic fare being crafted by contemporary DJs, eschews ready classification; on his website he writes simply: “They’re beats.” These beats spin hip-hop sounds with a bend toward dance and soul, and concertgoers on Sunday night will find them easy to nod heads, tap toes and maybe even wild out to. With production credits for the likes of Tinashe and Bryson Tiller, Sango is a few hits away from the canon of modern production tour de forces, and his show promises to bump as hard as his music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining Sango on tour as an opener is Monte Booker, his co-affiliate of the talent-stacked, L.A.-based music collective, Soulection. Booker is 21 and has already managed to synthesize a bouncy, multilayered sound all his own. Taking inspiration from the likes of Flying Lotus, Booker’s songs are textured, vibrant and playful, and are unlike many of the mass-produced and purveyed sounds of the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up for the evening is UCSB’s own <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/djunderbelly\">Underbelly</a>. Check out some Sango and Booker below, and don’t miss out on the show this Sunday; doors open at 8 p.m., and the show starts at 9 p.m.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

His tracks are easy to dance to and have a similar feel to Andrew Luce, another up-and-coming DJ who played at the Hub during Fall Quarter.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75441\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"482766820\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75441\" data-attachment-id=\"75441\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/elephante-1-26-17-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elephante 1-26-17-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75441 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The night’s opener, Sarthe, played to a cozy yet growing crowd. He remixed popular songs like Twenty One Pilots’ “The Judge,” gaining many cheers from the crowd while continually shouting, “Give it up if UCSB still parties like it used to!” (And believe me, we do.) Sarthe played a continuous set, moving from one song to another quickly and smoothly through soundboard effects. He’s a loud, big personality, interacting with the crowd and encouraging everyone to “Get weird.” The energy was already high nearly an hour before Elephante came on, and the Hub filled up quickly.

Opening with the track “Closer,” featuring Bishøp, he almost immediately captured the attention of anticipating students. The upbeat mix of dance, house and mellow EDM is easy for even the most casual electronic music fans to enjoy. He kept the crowd moving all night and students sang along to whimsical lyrics. His brand of music is perfect to let sparks fly; couples danced all throughout the crowd. Elephante’s beats are a clear rebellion against the buttoned-up corporate world, celebrating the simplest moments of electric excitement. He intoxicated crowds with trippy music and the lights behind him framed his silhouette. The beat drop in “Dynasty” with MIIA elicited cheers and synchronized swaying.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

By 10:30 p.m., all you could see was the hands of dancers in front of you illuminated by colorful stage lights on a perfectly transformed dance floor, backed by a beer garden. Flanked by the bookstore and surrounded by popular on-campus restaurants, the Hub really feels like home. Watching artists perform there has an interesting appeal because of how greatly transformed it is from the bustling student center it is during the daytime. It enables UCSB music lovers to magically transform from top scholars to dancers after nightfall.</p>\n<p>A large part of Elephante’s appeal is his background, particularly how he stood up to his family and peers and went after his musical goals. Dropping out of school to pursue a career in the music industry is risky, but it’s undoubtedly paid off for him. Seeing and supporting growing artists is a great way to get exposed to new music and, in Elephante’s case, a great example of a student following their heart. Having an up-and-coming artist play in the Hub is a unique experience we as UCSB students get to experience. There is such a contagious excitement in a room full of young people pursuing their dreams and watching others succeed as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/","id":6706,"author":{"id":705,"name":"Olivia Yazzolino"},"related":[6705,6704,6703],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Atomics Are a Blast from the Past","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=948%2C362&ssl=1","description":"Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world.

Some would say the Smiths are “genetically blessed” or “musically talented”—close to having it all. I’ll say they’re definitely something else. With a mere entrance they seem like they’re from the 70s, which may stem from their early upbringing and roots in Spanish Fork, Utah, a small town one hour south of Salt Lake City.</p>\n<p>“We got instruments for Christmas when we were younger. When we first started, we lived in Utah, so we just set up all our instruments in the family room. We’ve been playing since then, but it was probably seven or eight years ago when we said, ‘Let’s form a band and play shows.’ We had our name, ‘The Atomics,’ and that was it. We’ve been doing this for a long time, but it keeps transitioning,” Daisy spilled.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Lucky on drums, Pyper on bass, Daisy on guitar and Starlie on lead vocals, these siblings are invincible.

Pyper impressed the audience with her dance moves, iconically falling to the ground with her guitar. The song, “Cuz You’re in Love,” was featured in a recent H&amp;M campaign video. It’s slow sound and wave-like beat transformed the audience from jumping up and down to a nonchalant sway. The Smiths closed their set with their latest song, “Voulez Vous,” which was released in October and is available for listening on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world. All four are signed with Next Models, Los Angeles. Pyper discussed balancing music with modeling, “Well, I can’t choose between the two because they’re so different, even though they’re both in the entertainment industry. Like with music I’m a bit more free, I play what I want and dress how I want,” she said. “With modeling, everyone’s doing what they want to me and I’m trying to create an image for them. Scheduling wise it’s good because modeling is during the day. There’s set times and our photo shoots are usually in the morning, so I can always do music at night. It’s fun to do both.”</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Voulez Vous by THE ATOMICS\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286907145&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The amazing thing about this family band is how eclectic and original their sound is, yet it’s retro psychedelic. “When we first started playing together we played surf music, so we did a lot of Ventures covers,” Daisy added. “Our influences differ a lot depending on which band member you’re talking to. Like I play guitar, so I love like Dick Dale and Chuck Berry. Lucky loves old school hip-hop beats, while Pyper loves disco music and Starlie loves jazz and soulful singers.”</p>\n<p>With so much to juggle as band mates, modeling partners and siblings, the Smiths’ still get the job done. They’ve successfully assimilated into the Californian rock’n’roll lifestyle, all while walking runways such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Bottega Veneta, Fendi and Tom Ford.</p>\n<p>“In the next year we’ll be playing Coachella. We’re going to be in Europe doing shows, so I think it’s going to be a lot of traveling, which is always fun with my siblings,” Pyper said, reflecting on what’s to come in the next few months. “I hope that we can develop our music more because a lot of our songs are different. I hope that we can focus in on a sound we all really love and become tighter as a band.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75421\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75421\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/","id":6704,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6703,6702,6701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Switchfoot and Relient K Rock the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=900%2C529&ssl=1","description":"Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday evening, alternative rock bands Relient K and Switchfoot performed at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara as a part of the “Looking for America Tour Part II.” Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike. Both bands had plenty of these to perform, as they’ve been active since the late ’90s, and each released an album earlier this year. Switchfoot’s July 2016 album, <em>Where the Light Shines Through</em>, provided the tour’s name with one of its tracks, “Looking for America.” Relient K’s eighth album, <em>Air for Free</em>, was released later that month.</p>\n<p>The show began with Relient K taking the stage, designed to resemble the yard of a quaint cabin in the woods, complete with a white buffalo and a strip of artificial turf. This scene was characteristic of the band, who are “quirky, super-relatable … not-typical rock stars,” as attendee Chad Jordan described. As soon as the band took the stage, they launched into the opening strums of their hit song, “High of 75.” This beginning, met with emphatic applause, preceded upbeat songs such as “Who I Am Hates Who I’ve Been,” “Be My Escape” and “Sadie Hawkins Dance.”</p>\n<p>The music was interspersed with introductions and light-hearted stories from lead singer Matt Thiessen. In a particular moment of nostalgia, he mentioned that during a past tour stop, he purchased 30 shirts at a now-defunct Santa Barbara clothing store. Later in the set, Thiessen noted his band and Switchfoot’s partnership with a charity organization called CURE International, which provides surgeries for conditions such as cleft palates to children who would not ordinarily be able to receive them. Thiessen encouraged the audience to visit the organization’s booth outside, also mentioning to the audience that the first leg of the tour resulted in over 100 surgeries for children.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Relient K concluded their set with their 11-minute song, “Deathbed,” from their fifth album, <em>Five Score and Seven Years Ago</em>. The album version of the song features Jon Foreman, the lead singer of Switchfoot, at the very end, so many fans of the groups undoubtedly hoped he would come on stage to sing his part. Sure enough, when the song neared his cue, the singer came out, embracing Thiessen as he played the piano, then advanced to the microphone to sing. It yielded a very powerful end to Relient K’s portion of the concert.</p>\n<p>Once Relient K’s cabin background and décor was replaced by various monitors, the stage was set for Switchfoot. Each member of the group, save Jon Foreman, came to the stage, with Foreman’s silhouette depicted on a monitor. Foreman began to sing “Holy Water,” and soon made his welcome arrival on stage. The group followed this with one of its earlier hits, “Meant to Live,” shortly after which Foreman wasted no time interacting with the audience. After beginning “Bull in a China Shop,” the lead singer climbed down from the stage and into the audience, balancing on the theatre seats with support from enthusiastic attendees and went back about five rows into the audience before returning to the stage. Foreman made his way into the audience later in the concert as well, creating a very personal experience, especially for those seated near the front.</p>\n<p>After playing a fair amount of more recent songs, especially those from their most recent album, the band played one of their earliest hits and a powerful ballad, “Only Hope.” Toward the beginning of the tune, Foreman urged the audience to turn on their cell phones’ flashlights and sway them with the music, following that up with a request for the stage lights to be shut off. The result was a theater solely illuminated by the spectacle of the tilting lights. The song itself possessed a certain impact as well; attendee and physical therapist Taisa Skovorodkl said she “totally fangirled out on ‘Only Hope,’ cause it was like memories of high school all over again.”</p>\n<p>After several more songs, Thiessen and Relient K’s drummer, Dave Douglas, returned to the stage to contribute vocals, then left Switchfoot to give a proper end to the concert with their most popular hit, “Dare You To Move.” The song was prefaced with Foreman relating that he first sung it shortly after dropping out of college, and that no matter where you are, you don’t know what tomorrow may hold.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/","id":6705,"author":{"id":704,"name":"Isaac Mikulski"},"related":[6704,6703,6702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It’s Lit!:  Fear and Loathing (and God) in Literature","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_0176-e1463013762613.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_0176-e1463013762613.jpg?resize=800%2C317&ssl=1","description":"This week, Natalie Noblett takes on Alida Nugent’s in-your-face but wildly fun Don't Worry, It Gets Worse while Allie Graydon reflects on Neil Gaiman's modern rendering of ancient myths in American ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Welcome to Artsweek’s literature crossing!

The novel follows Shadow, a recently released convict who finds his wife has suddenly died. Without a place to go, he agrees to work for a shady man named Wednesday who shows him that gods and mythical creatures live among humans and are weakened by disbelief. The novel depicts an America that worships technology and corporate growth in place of ancient gods, creating a new form of worship that overpowers tradition. As Wednesday leads Shadow across America, Shadow prepares for a conflict of epic proportions that could change the world forever. Gaiman skillfully transforms ancient myths into fresh, modern characters while still maintaining their instantly recognizable characteristics.</p>\n<p>The novel is a bounty of personality and detail with vivid descriptions of clothes, accents and smells that give the characters intricately defined images. In this blending of two worlds, Gaiman’s matter-of-fact tone and third-person narration brings the incomprehensible talk of gods down to earth. He describes impossible concepts in simple terms and he chillingly presents horrific moments with blunt detail. In this way, narrative takes a backseat to the tone and mood of each scene and the colorful personalities met along the way.</p>\n<p>Like the drama of Greek figures in mythology or even the bickering when Superman meets Batman, each interaction between gods is an intricate character study and clashing of ideals. The novel fully pulls the reader in, however, by masterfully raising more questions than answers with every page, spreading a breadcrumb trail of plot twists that make characters unsure about their next move. With its new take on myth and exploration of what it means to be a god, <em>American Gods</em> provides a new perspective on the things America believes in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Natalie Noblett on <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> by Alida Nugent</strong><br>\nAre you equal parts terrified and excited for the future? Do you check your bank account multiple times a day and shudder at the remaining balance? Do you consider Netflix and Kirkland wine better friends than living, breathing humans? These are the types of questions Alida Nugent uses to determine if this novel is right for your life. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> accurately conveys the unfortunate truth of adulthood. It is an awkward, moneyless period of time. In a personal re-telling of her post-college years and her mastery of uncomfortable situations, Nugent is honest and candid with readers by neglecting to sugarcoat any event in her life. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em>, however, is not a depressing book about how life beyond college leaves you terrifyingly broke and drunk by 10 a.m. But, it is a <em>comedy</em> about how life beyond college leaves you terrifyingly broke and drunk by 10 a.m.! Nugent sympathizes with fellow victims of college debt and uncertainty of the future, struggling to make the petrifying leap into adulthood. What’s fresh about this novel is that there is not a satisfying, finite resolution. Like the rest of us, Nugent emphasizes that she still doesn’t have all of her shit together, and that’s okay (I mean, really, who does?). Recovering from the hopelessness of the country’s economic status after graduating, Nugent manages to make the best out of an ultimately unfortunate situation. <em>Don’t Worry, It Gets Worse</em> is like a drunken conversation with your roommate at 2 a.m. on a Wednesday night: refreshing, blunt and uproarious.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/its-lit-fear-and-loathing-and-god-in-literature/","id":6953,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6952,6951,6950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tracks of the Month: January 2017","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TOTM-Post.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At the end of each calendar month, Artsweek takes a look at new tracks that stood out and made a place in our playlists.

Its challenges in balance, from tone to pace, keep Mortilla’s ever changing melody on its toes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As part of The Carsey-Wolf Center’s 2017 winter events, “Expanded Hitchcock” is a new series that explores the work of director Alfred Hitchcock, whose influence and career spanned over six decades. Each classic film will be examined in a new light with the help of guest speakers, including film scholars, industry experts and “The Birds” actress Tippi Hedren.</p>\n<p>The Expanded Hitchcock series began with 1929’s “Blackmail,” a British thriller that was released in both silent and sound versions. As Britain’s first sound film, it was, and still is, heavily praised for its groundbreaking accomplishments. However, the silent version seems greatly preferred in the critic’s eye. Despite Hitchcock’s surprising early control and mastery of sound technique, critics often point to the silent version as the stronger of the two. One such critic happens to be guest Michael Mortilla, an incredibly talented and highly sought after freelance composer, who provided an original, live piano accompaniment for the rarely seen silent version of Hitchcock’s “Blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Mortilla’s resume is remarkably impressive. From composing for the 1996 Olympic Games to his multiple commissions from the Library of Congress, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the National Film Preservation Foundation, it’s easy to see Mortilla’s wide reach and influence in the art of sound design. However, one of his most impressive feats has to be his recent work at the New Objectivity exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in January of last year. Mortilla played for more than eight hours straight, providing accompaniment to four lengthy films. While this would be impressive on its own, there is one thing that separates Mortilla from most modern day composers: everything he composes is completely improvised, including Thursday night’s performance of “Blackmail.” That, and the fact that he didn’t leave that eight-hour LACMA performance even once to use the restroom, is perhaps the most remarkable thing about Michael Mortilla.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As much as the night was an exploration of the rarely seen silent version of “Blackmail,” it was equally a celebration of the wonderful creativity of Mortilla. Moderator Charles Wolfe, a professor of the Film &amp; Media Studies Department at UCSB, began the post-screening interview by asking Mortilla how he prepared and executed his performance with such precision without the aid of a score or sheet music. After jokingly refusing to answer Wolfe’s question, Mortilla began to explain his technique.</p>\n<p>He begins his rehearsals by improvising through an entire screening of whatever film he is to perform to. This can include anywhere from seven dry runs to none at all. This time, however, he “practiced his ass off.” He typically continues to improvise until “something sticks,” at which point he begins to solidify a general outline of his upcoming performance. For “Blackmail,” he knew he was ready when he was able to play his entire piece without the help of the film, relying entirely on his memory.</p>\n<p>While he doesn’t have a score, Mortilla does have a general feeling as to what the film should sound like. “The screen is my palette,” said Mortilla, beginning to explain the ways in which he concentrates his improvisation on a diegetic grounding. His overall goal is to “create an actual atmosphere that the people actually live in,” and so his improvisation is mostly inspired by the story and themes of the films themselves. This focus on a narrative theme and feeling helps keep Mortilla on track and ties his improvisation together within the confines of the film. For “Blackmail,” the result is a tense and percussive theme that reinforces the film’s stressful, noir tone. In fact, it was Hitchcock’s often complicated and layered tone that influenced much of Mortilla’s own score for “Blackmail.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75261\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1234001996\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75260\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75261\" data-attachment-id=\"75261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/blackmail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=2048%2C1436&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1436\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"blackmail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=888%2C623&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75261 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail-250x175.jpg?resize=250%2C175\" width=\"250\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=768%2C539&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p>With a penchant for dark humor and irony, Hitchcock often complicates the lines between a suspenseful thriller and a tongue-in-cheek comedy. Mortilla had to address this dichotomy, deciding his score had to “keep an emotional content void.” With so many layers of emotion and underscores of ironic impending tragedy behind nearly every scene, the score could not be entirely happy nor entirely sad. In the end, the score had to arrive at a neutral energy level, with the occasional spike and suspenseful build up.</p>\n<p>Mortilla had to consider the same balancing technique when it came to Hitchcock’s peculiar pacing of the film. “The pacing changes in a snap second,” answered Mortilla, when asked how his score was influenced by Hitchcock’s use of motion. With both the camera and actor moving and stopping so frequently in “Blackmail,” Mortilla had to be ready to stop at a moment’s notice. However, this is one of the many things Mortilla loves about Hitchcock: the way “he suspends time, (and) forces us to go slow,” as if the director himself was telling Mortilla to stop. And that is exactly what Mortilla does.</p>\n<p>When he goes to see other live accompanists, he ends up wanting “to run out of the theatre screaming.” His frustration stems from seeing the other silent film accompanists playing for themselves and showcasing their own talent, instead of sitting down and playing what would be best for the film. According to Mortilla, there is only a “pocket” of four or five composers who play to the film in the same manner as he does. Mortilla believes what many of the musicians lack is a proper background in movement, as most of them aren’t rooted in genres associated with dance. Mortilla, however, is no stranger to movement and dance. In addition to his previous work as the former resident composer for UCSB’s Theater and Dance department, Mortilla also worked very closely with Martha Graham — the mother of modern dance — composing and playing for her and her dance troupe across the nation for a variety of events.</p>\n<p>For Mortilla, improvisation is all dance, and it’s no doubt one of the reasons he finds a love for Hitchcock. “Blackmail” is the perfect film for which Michael Mortilla to compose to. Its challenges in balance, from tone to pace, keep Mortilla’s ever changing melody on its toes. Each key is pressed for the sake of the film. In his own words, it’s as if a “ghost is in my fingers, making rhythms for me.”</p>\n<p>For the next installement of the Expanded Hitchcock series, or for other Carsey-Wolf Center screenings, go online to <em>carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75260\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75260\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/","id":5820,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5819,5818,5817],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":23,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
