Luckily for those fans that would’ve otherwise spent the consumerist holiday wallowing in a puddle of self-pity and loneliness, they received a gift from Yeezus himself.</p>\n<p>However, there was a slight catch. Access to the album could only be obtained through a subscription to Jay Z’s streaming service, Tidal. That being said, the demand for new Ye is undisputed. Overnight, Tidal went from struggling to stay afloat to number one in the app store solely due to the exclusivity. #FACTS</p>\n<p>But, what’s up with the name?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last year, Mr. West began stirring the pot by releasing the album’s original name, <em>So Help Me God</em>. Shortly after, the title was changed to <em>SWISH</em>, which held strong until very recently when Kanye revealed a shift to <em>Waves</em>. The new name ignited a feud with Wiz Khalifa who believed Kanye stole the slang from imprisoned rapper Max B, curator of the term, “wavy” (publicity stunt, perhaps?). After wife Kim Kardashian conducted various Twitter polls about the three possible title choices, Kanye ultimately chose none of the above. Shocker.</p>\n<p>The meaning behind <em>The Life of Pablo</em> sparked the imaginations of many Twitter philosophers.</p>\n<p>Theories about the ever elusive “Pablo” went rampant, ranging from the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar to Pablo Picasso, arguably the most influential artist of the 20th century. The latter is more likely when taking in account the lyric, “I feel like Pablo when I’m working on my shoes” and Kanye’s self-proclaimed title as one of the greatest artists of all time.</p>\n<p>However, new rumors stated that Kanye claimed Pablo is actually a reference to St. Paul (Pablo in Spanish) which fits the gospel tunes in “Ultralight Beam,” “Father Stretch My Hands,” his son’s own name and the allusions of Mary and Joseph in the revamped version of “Wolves.”</p>\n<p>Part of the genius of TLOP lies in its hectic release. Kanye gave his fans a front row seat to the makings of an album. It went from an obscure process that magically occurred behind closed doors to a play-by-play experience filled with raw, uncut footage.</p>\n<p>Before embarking on the journey of <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, one must bring their sense of humor because first and foremost, the album is ridiculous. From its multiple name changes and ever-changing track lists, label as a “gospel album,” parade of features and cockiness every step of the way, the purposeful outrageousness is clear.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be talked about. “Everyone gonna say something … I’d be worried if they said nothing”. And what better way to get people talking than with insults? In between poking fun at Rob for his weight and sexual endeavors and reminding Ray J that it doesn’t matter who “may have hit it first,” he also managed to (accidentally?) reignite a feud with Taylor Swift. But hey, who can blame the guy? He already admitted, “I don’t know what it is with females … I’m not too good with that shit.”</p>\n<p>However, the braggadocio humor in “Famous” and “Highlights” starkly contrasts the self-reflection in “Real Friends” and “30 Hours,” which represents Kanye’s game face in social circles as compared to his inner thoughts respectively. He also uses TLOP to reinforce the juxtaposition between the profane and the sacred that has come to identify most of his work. Hence, “pray for Paris, pray for the parents” transitions to “now if I fuck this model and she just bleached her asshole …” Granted, not his best lyrically, but the duality is important here.</p>\n<p>It’s bipolar and doesn’t always make sense. Just like humanity. Kanye’s sometimes flawed, but complete honesty makes TLOP so monumental. It reveals the good, bad and the ugly in humanity.</p>\n<p>And the constant revisions that occurred up until the minute the album was released were not hints of sloppiness, but rather the strokes of creative liberty and passion. Without Chance the Rapper’s last minute prodding to keep “Waves,” already a favorite track, the album would be missing a vital organ. The transition between “I Love Kanye” to “Waves” is so flawless that it makes you wonder how the song was passed up in the first place.</p>\n<p>But yes, overall the album is disjointed.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks cohesion.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks an overarching message.</p>\n<p>However, are those really problems? Since when did cohesiveness become a staple for artistic expression? Keep in mind that TLOP is coming from an artist who has already proven he is capable of impeccable mixing and mastering. He revolutionized a genre with every album he has put out. He already made his political statements clear. He even created “so many Kanyes.” Therefore, a lack of cohesion cannot be a mere mistake. It cannot be the effect of mediocre mixing. It must be intentional. It’s life.</p>\n<p><em>The Life of Pablo </em>takes you from church to the club to the cemetery. Kanye even manages to bring Frank Ocean out from hiding for this one. It is brilliant in its unpolished realness. So, now, it’s time to just “shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/","id":6798,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6797,6796,6795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zion I Brings the Beat to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-zion-e1455776307158.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-zion-e1455776307158.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"An MC spits lightning-fast rhymes from onstage.

A few hippie-looking girls stand in the middle of the club, twirling around. One scraggily bearded and tie-dye adorned individual dances, spinning bolos with rainbow neon lights attached to the end. Throughout the night, Friday-night regulars — young people dressed for the club — would trickle in. But for now, the floor belongs to counterculture vagrant-ish looking people. The stage belongs to Brayell, the Southern Californian rapper opening the show.</p>\n<p>Clearly grounded in a tradition of west coast freestyle, he rattles off rhymes with the speed that makes you wonder if he needed to do diction exercises before stepping out on stage. Aside from his rapping, Brayell (born Brandon Kelly) boasts a variety of talents. He frontlines his own band. He produces many of his own beats and plays various instruments when he records those beats.</p>\n<p>After Brayell finishes, rapper James Kaye takes the stage. Kaye bounces around the stage frenetically. His physicality informs his show. The artist likes to jump around. At one point, Kaye leaps off the stage to mosh with audience members. In a night largely dominated by freestyling, this performance distinguishes itself with its underlying electronic-pop beats. The style culminates in the riotously fun, self-hype anthem “How Come,” the chorus of which goes “If I didn’t make it, how come everybody know my name?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brayell’s and Kaye’s music is available on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Finally Zion I mounts the stage. Rather than announcing themselves with the usual fanfare, MC Zumbi and rapping partner Deuce Eclipse simply stand up and begin their set. The duo’s song transitions are seamless, forgoing pauses to constantly inform the audience where they are. It almost feels like Zumbi and Eclipse go for an hour without pause. This feat is especially impressive considering MC Zumbi’s age. Zion I was formed in the mid-’90s and has been a significant force in the underground and alternative rap worlds since the early 2000s. Zumbi doesn’t have the same love of milking stage time that younger performers often have, but, to his credit, he never flags and pushes himself through a solid, hour-long set.</p>\n<p>MC Zumbi (or Baba Zumbi) spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> about the show and his upcoming projects. He spoke about the medley of musical styles that go into his beats.</p>\n<p>“Always like a fusion with the beats I like, it’s got a soulful vibe, melodic, but also has that pounding bass, too. We do it all, man. I mean, I’m a child of the culture,” Zumbi said.</p>\n<p>He also commented on what led to Zion I’s eclectic mix of music.</p>\n<p>“I was born in Philadelphia, I lived in Texas, I moved to the west coast, I went to school in Atlanta … I’ve experienced hip-hop in all these different places,” Zumbi said.</p>\n<p>The different influences are audible in the performance. Zumbi favors call-and-response audience interactions. He offers up a song, “Save a Soul,” from his upcoming album. The beat is electronic and bears the hallmarks of trip-hop sounds.</p>\n<p>Zion I also embodies comradery on stage. Besides their call-and-response and prompting of the audience to sing along, they also start a “peace, love and harmony” chant. They bring the openers, both Kaye and Brayell, back on stage to freestyle and jam with them. The performers clearly pride themselves on creating genuine connections to the audience. Rapper Deuce Eclipse also had a word with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself on that west coast freestyle, just off the dome, kinda in the moment. The more I feel the crowd, the more I’m able to express myself,” Eclipse said.</p>\n<p>Freestyling for these performers clearly involves sensing the rhythms of the audience.</p>\n<p>“The crowd out here is so hyped, and they just give you that energy so you just work with it, kinda close your eyes and just let yourself free” Eclipse elaborated.</p>\n<p>When Zion I finally gets to their hit single, “Coastin,” the audience cheers and sings along. Zion I welcomes it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68371\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/zion-i-brings-the-beat-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68371\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/zion-i-brings-the-beat-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/zion-i-brings-the-beat-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/zion-i-brings-the-beat-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/zion-i-brings-the-beat-to-velvet-jones/","id":6802,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6801,6800,6799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"STRFKR Gets Rowdy in VNTRA","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=800%2C517&ssl=1","description":"STRFKR is very serious about not being taken too seriously.

Ironically lifting their name from the label slapped onto those willfully entrenched in the celebrity lifestyle they so eschew, STRFKR’s live set perfectly crystallizes their direct dedication to keeping things fun.</p>\n<p>Fake Drugs started the show off with a set hurtling down a cyberpunk highway at 80 mph on a Tron bike. The electro-punk duo slapped some frenetic strings over new wave synths and squawked distorted, unintelligible vocals. While the Drugs maintained a high energy throughout, their show would’ve been greatly enhanced by the addition of a live drummer; without one, they lacked the rawness that an exciting punk act should exhibit. Though not all that compelling in and of itself, their synthy vibe served to whet the collective appetite for Com Truise, the second act of STRFKR’s winter tour.</p>\n<p>Com Truise seemed to appear all at once, assuming his position helming an expansive dual-Macbook mixing station. Silent and stoic and clad in a plain black tee, he spun a pulsing set of his ’80s synthwave repertoire. Com Truise and the entire stage were highlighted over by melting geometries in neon pastels, unfortunately dim as a result of presumably deficient projector settings. Enthused audience members cast crude shadow puppets on the spiraling visuals, nipping and winking innocently at the unalterable DJ. After bumping back-to-back jams like crowd favorite “VHS Sex,” Com Truise departed coolly, without a word. His music spoke loudly enough to set the perfect palette for STRFKR to paint their vibrant poppy melodies with.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the crowd shuffled with anticipation for the main event, a fog machine puffed out its haze incessantly, shrouding the stage in mystique. As STRFKR took the stage and began to play, the reason become clear; the six pillars of shifting light and color standing behind the band was allowed to play in the negative space, effusing a chameleon glow throughout the theater, perfectly timed with their upbeat rhythms.</p>\n<p>The set was constant crescendo. Despite maintaining their grooving mellow throughout, the band managed to draw out more and more crazed feedback from their audience with every song. Draped in a velvet dress that could’ve been snatched from his grandmother’s closet, frontman Joshua Hodges crooned softly as his bandmates deftly riffed through their collection of indie poptronica tunes. The four appeared a little bit mismatched on stage, to charming effect. Pointing out each member individually, UCSB second-year Johanna Ramirez noted “That one looks like he came from a Renaissance faire, that one looks like a dad, that one a college dropout and that guy a high school student that plays in a band at night.”</p>\n<p>Despite their quirky aesthetic differences, the band expertly meshed together sonically.</p>\n<p>The four of them stayed playful throughout, not afraid to shuffle up their spots on stage. Hodges and drummer Keil Corcoran traded spots for “German Love,” and bassist Shawn Glassford joined the scramble for a trio of covers, including The Human League’s “Don’t You Want Me” and New Order’s “Blue Monday.” During their famous rendition of Cyndi Lauper’s (er, Robert Hazard’s) “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” friends of the band arrived on stage decked out in spacesuits to launch confetti cannons from their groins. The rowdy astronauts also incited a spree of (excessive) crowdsurfing throughout the audience, much to the chagrin of the venue’s hyperactive security guards.</p>\n<p>After blasting through hits like “Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second,” “Malmo” and “While I’m Alive,” the band departed to clamorous roars from the audience. As a soft light hung in the foggy haze, recorded speech (presumably the words of Alan Watts, a big influence on Hodges) was drowned out by the calls of the crowd for more. The intermission stretched on, but the crowd was relentless, erupting ecstatically when the band resumed the stage to close the night out with an encore consisting of “Pop Song” and “Bury Us Alive,” culminating with a rock-star performance of “Leave It All Behind” among flaring strobes of darkness and white light. By the end of the set, Hodges lank hair stuck to his forehead, a facsimile of the turbo energy the audience channeled increasingly up to the very last song of the night. The band thanked their parents watching above in the Ventura Majestic’s closed-off balcony, and left the stage graciously to the applause of a crowd that’d just had a seriously good FKing time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/","id":6797,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6796,6795,6794],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Citizen Cope Brings V-Day to SOhO Early","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-citizen-cope.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-citizen-cope.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was like any other Friday night in downtown Santa Barbara.

The streetlights illuminated couples, friends and acquaintances, all making their way to the next restaurant, bar or both. Everyone was ready to find some escape this President’s Day weekend. SOhO’s signature brick walls enclosed a full house that night, it’s patrons eagerly awaiting to see Citizen Cope (Clarence Greenwood) perform his <em>With Love</em> compilation. The compilation is a journey through Cope’s discography starting from the nineties till now. A majority of the crowd appeared to be older than your average UCSB student, all die hard lovers of his music.</p>\n<p>Daniel Vasquez, the manager of the club that night who had seen Citizen Cope some time before, assured me that this would be an enjoyable performance. He also mentioned that Cope was very particular about how his audience behaves during his sets. Apparently, he has been known to walk off the stage due to rambunctious crowds. This explained all of the signs posted around the venue asking its patrons to be respectful toward the solo act that night.</p>\n<p>The request appeared strange at first; however, the crowd worked as one so as to maintain a certain level of peace. Citizen Cope walked on stage to great applause, his warm smile drawing the remainder of the restaurant to the stage. Bathed in blue, red and purple light, Citizen Cope began his set, treating spectators to the solemn and gentle chords from his guitar. Cope’s music jumps between genres, sometimes lying directly in between two. He will blend and borrow from various styles and make them his own. His <em>With Love</em> compilation showcases his talents in playing blues, rock, hip hop and more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Citizen Cope delivered Friday night, his voice adding a degree of authenticity and soul to his past works. With each part of his set, Cope channeled the pain and moments of love present in his lyrics. The crowd quietly sang along and swayed with their significant others, possibly remembering past relations or happy romances. Who knows? With songs like “Salvation” and “Bullet and a Target,” one experiences a darker side to the narratives Cope wrote into his songs. The disco ball overhead swayed slowly, reflecting the stage lights through the rafters of the venue. Through the haze of purple, the crowd danced slowly along to the steady rhythm of Cope’s set. It was an amusing sight when fans shushed pockets of patrons of the louder variety as the next song began, most likely to ensure the best show possible. As a collective, spectators cheered as Cope began performing favorite after favorite. “Let the Drummer Kick” had Cope playing alongside a recorded beat and piano melody; he jokingly said to the crowd, “This next acoustic song is gonna have some accompaniment with some tape. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to play it, and I know all of you want to hear it.” The crowd responded ecstatically as a bass kick and snare hit shook the venue, bodies moving to the steady hiss of a hi-hat.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope returned for an encore to a still-packed venue. The cheers called Cope back to the stage for a few more songs to close out the night. “Hurricane Waters” had the audience participate by clapping along to the beat, echoing “I will carry you” and “hurricane waters.” The crowd’s voice bounced across the walls, creating a serene moment between them and Cope at the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope brought an intense mixture of blues, rock and hip hop to SOhO. His voice complimented the bluesy scales, it’s accent almost morphing away from the west coast to something more mid-western or southern. Cope finished up a fantastic show, bringing out love and a whole box of other emotions for the venue to experience — definitely an appropriate start to the three day weekend and Valentine’s Day.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/","id":6796,"author":{"id":724,"name":"Vincent Beck"},"related":[6795,6794,6793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"KCSB Annual Fund Drive is Back","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fund-drive-ad.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fund-drive-ad.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"KCSB’s Annual Fund Drive is back!

manages to draw an engaging assortment of industry professionals to speak on the ins and outs of their trade, which is most likely at least partially due to the festival’s snug proximity to the Academy Awards ceremony. A woman in line for the panels could be overheard speaking about how, because it’s after the Oscars, the San Francisco festival she’s involved with gets a far shabbier turnout of celebrity guests than Santa Barbara’s. Indeed, every speaker on the back-to-back producers and writers panels is nominated for an Oscar this year, working on some levels to promote their films among the city’s menagerie of retired Academy voters.</p>\n<p>Though the writer’s panel was, unsurprisingly, the more compelling of the two, the speakers on “Movers &amp; Shakers,” the producer’s panel, shared some intriguing behind-the-scenes tidbits about their respective projects. Brooklyn’s Finola Dwyer spoke on the challenges of transforming Montreal into 1950s New York, and Mary Parent of “The Revenant” similarly remarked on the magic of transcribing the 1820s American Midwest upon the isolated snowy peaks of Argentina. Parent also quipped that it was the first production she’d been on that set an electric fence up around the caterers to protect them from hungry bears; fortunately, everyone on set avoided Hugh Glass’s grisly fate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both Jeremy Kleiner (“The Big Short”) and Steve Golin (“Spotlight”) discussed how their systematically challenging films are set to be screened for representatives of the very institutions they criticize, the former to a group of bipartisan congressmen, and the latter at the Vatican itself. On the topic of challenging institutions, the (all white) panelists very briefly, semi-awkwardly touched on the issue of the Oscars’ lack of recognition of diverse talent. Kleiner shrewdly noted, “The Academy is at one end of a long chain of decision making,” scratching the surface of the overwhelming bias toward white involvement in all aspects of film industry production. While it’s true that the Academy’s nomination decisions take place at the far end of this chain, producers’ roles are at the other; they acknowledged the problem without drawing any productive conclusions concerned with solving it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68152\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-68152\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1391039039\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"68123\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68152\" data-attachment-id=\"68152\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/sbiff-panels-_-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Writers Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68152\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-68152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Writers Panel</p>\n<p>An hour and a half after the producers panel, every seat of downtown’s historic Lobero Theatre filled up as the sold-out “It Starts with the Script,” the festival’s largest panel of screenwriters to date, started up. All but two of this year’s 10 writing Oscar nominees took the stage to share insightful perspectives on their content and their craft.</p>\n<p>Pixar legend Pete Docter (“Toy Story,” “Monster’s Inc.,” “WALL-E,” “Up”) explained how often, the crux of a story doesn’t materialize until well into the writing process. He described coming upon a storyboarder’s sketch of the characters Joy and Sadness hugging, with the inscription ‘embrace sadness.’ “Wow,” Docter relayed, “That’s the movie!” That small incident led him to the film’s central theme: “the deeper happiness that comes from its relationship with sadness.” “Ex Machina’s” writer-director Alex Garland expressed similar structural perceptions. “Stories are like maths in some respects,” he noted. “The equation might just not work.” His observations on managing the intricately balanced ecosystem of a story drew murmurs and nods of assent from the rest of the panelists. He said that once you’d worked out and balanced issues in a script, “it’s not like the problems are gone, but they’ve settled, like all the spikes have gone down.”</p>\n<p>The writers went on to discuss thoroughly the nature of adaptation. Emma Donaghue wrote “Room,” an adaptation of her own novel, and found it “hugely satisfying to take this story and tell it over again.” She was especially delighted in seeing her characters have physical bodies, capable of expressing human subtleties words themselves can’t sufficiently describe. Donaghue also brought up a difference between film and novel writing that rang with veracity for her fellow writers, in that “A book has so much more room, so much more time … Film has this narrative thrust; it moves forward.” Jonathan Herman, writer of “Straight Outta Compton,” sardonically joked, “I understand why they hired me, ‘cause I’m a white, Jewish gay guy from Connecticut.” In adapting NWA’s story for the screen, he noticed “a “Rashomon” thing going on,” with Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E’s widow, Tomica Wright, all reporting conflicting versions of the story. In addition to struggling to capture a semblance of true events, Herman faced a hurdle in convincing hip hop mogul Ice Cube to be comfortable with his character exhibiting moments of weakness. “This is the way a movie goes,” Herman explained. “You gotta have a low point and some vulnerability so you can come back from it, you gotta have an arc — the audience will like you more that way.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Short’s” Charles Randolph shared perhaps the most engaging perceptions on the panel. Regarding his emotional standpoint while writing the film, Randolph explained that he was disheartened by the events of 2008, as he’d “always had this nagging feeling that our system was fair, that there was a tangible connection between success and moral goodness.” He embellished on “Short’s” use of narration and cutaways to break down its economic jargon, used by influential bankers to “obfuscate and hide and empower themselves.” The techniques also added to the film a “meta layer which not only described the things, but gave the audience something beyond the characters to connect with.” Aside from the probing intellectual discussion, Randolph admitted to slacking off as much as anyone else. He agreed with Josh Singer’s (“Spotlight”) praise of research, adding, “The great thing about research is you can just read the most obscure crap and think at the end of the day that you did something.”</p>\n<p>Other writers shared their treatises on procrastination; as a writer, it was encouraging to hear that professionals, too, have less-than-perfect working habits. Charlie Kaufman (“Being John Malkovich,” “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”), writer of the existential stop-motion drama “Anomalisa,” shared that in terms of having a solid structure, “I tend to try not to. When I have an idea, I like to keep the idea of exploring it alive.” He has also learned to build downtime into his writing, observing astutely, “When I’m blocked or procrastinating, I’m still writing. I just don’t know it.” “Carol” writer Phyllis Nagy also owned up to exhibiting unorthodox writing practices. “I write with constant stimuli,” she said. “I have to have the TV on, I have to have the radio on.” Drew Goddard penned “The Martian,” and shared a quirky anecdote about how, since his wife writes comedy and he writes drama, they avoid both genres. Instead, they “just watch really bad reality television.” Thus, the inspiration for “The Martian’s” “turn the beat around” scene struck him while he and his wife sat in bed watching Bravo.</p>\n<p>The panelists all provided fest-goers with unique, intuitive, unexpected perspectives on what it means to write films, imparting on them a greater understanding of this year’s most lauded releases and the act of filmmaking itself as an art.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Valentine’s Day, take part in something a little weird as KCSB, the UCSB Queer Art’s Collective and La Familia de Colores bring prom to Robertson Gym, featuring Shannon and the Clams, El Vez, the Mexican Elvis and Santa Barbara locals Oree &amp; the Doo Not Worries. Dubbed “No Body Holy — A Queer ’50s Prom,” a play on the legendary Buddy Holly, the night will be a prom experience for the outcast and the minority.</p>\n<p>Headliner Shannon and the Clams will bring their doo-wop tinged garage rock sound to the ‘50s prom in support of their 2015 release <em>Gone by the Dawn</em>. Consisting of bass player and lead vocalist Shannon Shaw, guitarist Cody Blanchard and drummer/keyboarder Nate Mayhem, the band has released two studio albums and two mixtapes online and have amassed a cult-like following among the Burger Records/DIY crowd. Hailing from Oakland, CA, Shannon and the Clams have taken their weird psych rock across North America and Europe, where they played headlining spots alongside Best Coast, Bleached and the Dum Dum Girls at female-led festivals like Burger A-Go-Go and larger gigs like Burgerama and Pinback.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While their discography is a consistent testament to their odd-ball sound and look, Shannon and the Clams have grown exponentially since their humble beginnings in the Bay, as they met at East Bay Arts School before releasing their debut in 2009. Three releases later, their contemporary, nostalgic aesthetic has only expanded as has their music and lyrics. In a pre-release interview for <em>Gone by the Dawn </em>by Noisey, Shaw explains the cleaner, experimental side of their sound on <em>Dawn, </em>noting that a lot of it came from the support of Sonny Smith, the namesake of indie band Sonny &amp; the Sunsets, and having him around as a second opinion. The band will embark on another tour shortly after they play Robertson, with a single California stop at Pappy &amp; Harriet’s in Pioneertown.</p>\n<p>El Vez, the Mexican Elvis, is the byproduct of musician Robert Lopez from Chula Vista, CA, who combines his own work with covers of classic rock songs with a Mexican flair. Known for incredible attention to detail and production value, Lopez will bring eccentric rock and roll to the ‘50s prom. He has released a myriad of albums under his name and under the Mexican Elvis, and has even starred in a few feature films and TV specials.</p>\n<p>Local band Oree &amp; the Doo Not Worries have created quite the name for themselves as they fully embody the culture that is the 50s, a perfect complement to the theme of the night. Lead singer Oree Holban is a UCSB alumnus with a Master of Fine Arts, combining his performing and songwriting skills in a self-proclaimed folk n’ roll band, along with current Gaucho Gabe Poissant on the keys and SB resident Simone Salmon on the harp.</p>\n<p>The night does not solely focus on these three performers — there will also be DJ sets by KCSB-FM DJs in-between sets, food, non-alcoholic beverages and a guaranteed good time. Tickets for the prom are available now for free at the A.S. Ticket Office and at the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and is open for all ages and the general public.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJalyeHLzjg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68181\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/50s-sock-hop-prom-featuring-shannon-and-the-clams-to-take-over-rob-gym/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68181\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/50s-sock-hop-prom-featuring-shannon-and-the-clams-to-take-over-rob-gym/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/50s-sock-hop-prom-featuring-shannon-and-the-clams-to-take-over-rob-gym/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/50s-sock-hop-prom-featuring-shannon-and-the-clams-to-take-over-rob-gym/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/50s-sock-hop-prom-featuring-shannon-and-the-clams-to-take-over-rob-gym/","id":6790,"author":{"id":723,"name":"Justin Taing"},"related":[6789,6788,6787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Spotlight” Shines Light on Church Abuse and Media Decline","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Keaton-McAdams_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Keaton-McAdams_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Spotlight” is a story of an exposé of child sexual abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests.

Surveys by the American Society of News Editors and the Pew Research Center estimate a 36 percent decline from daily newspaper editorial jobs since its peak in 1989.</p>\n<p>The state of investigative journalism is even more worrying. With the exorbitant amount of time and intricate research required to expose an issue — not to mention potential dead ends and legal battles — investigative writers are often the first to go. Reputable papers with award-winning investigative reporting projects such as Denver-serving <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> and national publications <em>Newsweek </em>and <em>Time</em> have either closed up shop or laid off most of these reporters.</p>\n<p>“Spotlight” follows four investigative reporters and their uncovering of a widespread scandal concerning child sex abuse and cover-up within a powerful institution, the Roman Catholic Church. These journalists, who were part of <em>The Boston Globe’s</em> investigative unit named Spotlight, and their media take a stand for justice and for reporting that won’t tolerate abuse by power-wielding individuals and institutions.</p>\n<p>“‘Spotlight’ has given a voice to all the survivors and has become a call to action for pursing justice around the world in regards to this issue,” said Mark Ruffalo, who was a late cancellation due to personal family matters, in an apologetic and appreciative video message that kicked off the event. “And being part of a truly beautiful ensemble cast with real chemistry was such a phenomenal experience for me and such a rare experience.”</p>\n<p>The film has had an incredible and poignant impact on the institutions, people and stories it portrays. Just last Thursday on Feb. 4, a Vatican commission on clerical sex abuse held a private screening of “Spotlight” on the eve of its three-day meeting at a church residence in central Rome.</p>\n<p>The day before on Feb. 3rd, SBIFF’s Executive Director Roger Durling himself published a column in the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, opening up about his traumatic experiences as a victim of priest child abuse and how movies saved his life by allowing him to feel vindicated. It’s a notion he continued to uphold as he moderated a discussion between Keaton, who plays editor Walter “Robby” Robinson, and McAdams, who portrays reporter Sacha Pfeiffer.</p>\n<p>“Film can help us not to feel alone because we’re all in the dark experiencing the same emotions and same things that are being projected on the screen,” said Durling. “What’s amazing about ‘Spotlight’ to me is that it’s more than just a film, it’s a cry of victory.”</p>\n<p>When asked if she knew what the outcome of the film would be, McAdams expressed that she didn’t. Though shocked at first in realizing how little she knew about the issue, she also recognized the need to tell the story.</p>\n<p>“The more I got into it, the more I realized you sort of can’t tell the story enough,” said McAdams. “So it became a no-brainer to do it regardless of the outcome and I’m so grateful that this is the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The evening took a trip down memory lane with clips from Keaton’s and McAdams’s most memorable films, including segments from “Mean Girls” and “Birdman.” Both stars have played an array of roles, but still manage to maintain honesty in approaching their characters, Durling notes, particularly praising McAdams’s empathetic yet driven interviewing method with the victims in “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>“I really took the lead from Sacha herself because Sacha is such an incredible listener,” said McAdams. “She just has an amazing ability to get people to open up.”</p>\n<p>Keaton, for his part, spent a lot of time with Robby in order to nail his character, keeping a keen eye on his mannerisms, his Boston accent and the solid way he held himself. However, he did not predict the depth and wide-ranging scope of the film’s significance either.</p>\n<p>“In terms of its impact, one would be, I think, presumptuous and extremely egotistical to think anything more than this is just a good thing to be a part of,” said Keaton. “You just go and do your best.”</p>\n<p>Keaton’s own impressive filmography includes two others — Ron Howard’s “The Paper” and Mick Jackson’s “Live from Baghdad” — in which he also plays the role of a reporter. A self-described news junkie, Keaton had once considered a career in journalism (having taken one or two classes in college), and, though he settled on acting, he never lost his journalistic curiosity.</p>\n<p>“When you’re dealing with news or journalism, which for me makes it exciting not just as an actor but also in life, it’s humming,” said Keaton. “There’s a frequency. When something’s reverberating, you can feel it because it’s true.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the newsrooms drew Keaton back in as he relays his plan to head back to his hometown of Pittsburgh with Robinson to speak to the staff of the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,</em> as well as to screen “Spotlight” and help fundraise for the paper.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a great editor there who I think was at <em>The Boston Globe</em>,” said Keaton. “And he’s trying not to lay people off.”</p>\n<p>This situation plays out all newsrooms with editors desperate to keep their staff intact amidst dwindling funds and readership. “Spotlight” itself addresses this issue when newly hired editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) of <em>The Boston Globe</em> expresses his concern to Walter “Robby” Robinson (Keaton) about declining subscription numbers and the Internet’s breach and disrupt into the classified business.</p>\n<p>“So you anticipate more cuts?” asks Robby.</p>\n<p>“I would assume so, yes, but what I’m more focused on right now is finding a way to make this paper essential to its readers,” answers Baron.</p>\n<p>“I like to think it already is.”</p>\n<p>“Fair enough. I just think we can do better.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that’s a conundrum with no easy fix. After more than a decade of news media decline and many attempts later, we are still searching for ways to “do better.” Furthermore, most child sexual abuses don’t end with just an exposé. Society constantly needs watchdog journalists to follow up. That’s a tall order now as many newsrooms in America are being held together by only shoestrings and bandages.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/","id":5902,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5901,5900,5899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Boston under the Spotlight","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rachel-mcadams-mark-ruffalo-brian-dg-arcy-michael-keaton-and-john-slattery-in-spotlight-cred-kerry-hayes-open-road-films_wide-a9ace4a3a9d3d271a45d19c7c220201b7656c7eb-s900-c85.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rachel-mcadams-mark-ruffalo-brian-dg-arcy-michael-keaton-and-john-slattery-in-spotlight-cred-kerry-hayes-open-road-films_wide-a9ace4a3a9d3d271a45d19c7c220201b7656c7eb-s900-c85.jpg?resize=900%2C506&ssl=1","description":"Taking place in late 2001, “Spotlight” follows the true story of the titular Spotlight special investigations team of The Boston Globe.

These four reporters begin an investigation into the sexual abuses committed by the Catholic clergy in Boston. Eventually, they go on to uncover a conspiracy that goes up to the Cardinal himself.</p>\n<p>The Screen Actors Guild recently deemed the film’s cast to be the best of any film in 2015, and it is easy to see why. What makes the performances great is that they balance being compelling and believable; they feel <em>natural. </em>These characters feel like they have working relationships with each other. They talk and emote like real people on account of an impressive degree of subtlety that the actors display. You don’t watch these big-name Hollywood vets and think that they’re obviously acting, trying to be someone they’re not. These are <em>real </em>people onscreen, so convincing is the illusion. It almost feels voyeuristic, like you’re spying on the actual journalists.</p>\n<p>Mark Ruffalo briefly disturbs this atmosphere when he delivers an impassioned diatribe to a stoic Michael Keaton. It feels a little like exposition in order to further drive home a point, but given how impassioned he feels about the issue he’s covering, I can buy the outburst.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That’s because it is definitely a story worth getting upset over. The Spotlight staff interviews several victims throughout the film, who describe, in vivid and gut-wrenching detail, what happened to them. You feel the hopelessness that these people, mostly men from broken homes, faced. This feeling is perfectly encapsulated in one brief shot: Brian d’Arcy’s Matt Carroll stands on an apartment balcony, taking notes as he interviews a victim. The two of them are framed against a massive Boston cathedral, looming ominously in the background.</p>\n<p>When “Spotlight” ends, it’s bittersweet. Although justice has been, in a way, served, I still wanted to see the aftermath. What happened to these journalists? How did the exposé affect their careers? What were the immediate effects of the article on the Catholic Church? I want more! Gimme a sequel! To me, that is a sign of a powerful story.</p>\n<p>But it does feel lacking in some regard. There was a particular narrative angle I thought was going to play out, mainly because the film suggested it. Stanley Tucci tells Mark Ruffalo’s Michael Rezendes that eventually, the massive beast that is the Catholic Church will eventually go after him. And they never do. The film doesn’t even make clear whether or not the Church was ever even aware that an investigation into their cover-up was underway. It feels like a piece of the narrative is missing.</p>\n<p>But I do want to make clear that what <em>is </em>here is great. I was totally engrossed in the team’s investigation. Like them, you feel curious about what’s really going on around Boston.</p>\n<p>You share their curiosity, their shock. You sympathize with the victims as they tell their stomach-churning stories.

This year’s premiere opened with Paramount Pictures’ adaption of the classic French children’s novel, <em>The Little Prince</em>. Published in 1943 by author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the children’s book is adapted to several languages and it is widely recognized by millions of fans around the world.</p>\n<p>The story of <em>The Little Prince</em> follows the adventure of the little boy from a distant planet who meets an elder aviator in the Sahara dessert. Together, the two companions seek out different planets before their final destination on their journey to Earth. However, the animated film directed by Mark Osborne is not a direct adaption of the book. Inspired by the story of the little prince’s world, the 2015 film creates its own plotline by introducing a set of new characters.</p>\n<p>Before stepping into famous the role of the aviator, Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges had some hesitations about portraying the beloved character.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I was concerned because it’s a wonderful book and I thought it wouldn’t be a good idea to just simply animate those classic illustrations,” the 66 year-old actor said. “That it didn’t ring right to me, and he [the director] said ‘no it’s not like that.’”</p>\n<p>The director was able to win over the Academy Award winner using a very convincing object: “I notice he’s holding a suitcase, so I asked ‘what’s that suitcase’ then he said ‘well, I have something to show you,’” Bridges said. “He opens the suitcase and it sort of looked the suitcase little prince would have carried with him on his journey and all kind of magical things that let me know that his imagination was in the right spot,” Bridges said.</p>\n<p>The film begins with the story of a young girl (voiced by Edward and Bella’s daughter in “Twilight,” Mackenzie Foy) and her mother (Rachel McAdams) as they prepare for the admission process of a strict education. The mother puts her daughter on a disciplined academic schedule for her to excel in school, but the agenda is interrupted when the little girl meets her next-door neighbor, a retired aviator. From then on, the aviator introduces the little girl to his story of a young prince whom he had journeyed with on different planets.</p>\n<p>When asked about her favorite part of the book, Mackenzie Foy spoke of the scene where a hat was in fact an elephant inside a snake.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I read it, I went around showing all my friends, asking ‘what do you see, what do you see? Is it a hat or a snake around an elephant?’” 15-year-old Foy said. “Before I did a session, I’d read the book, just to get a feel of it, that way, it’s easier to bring a feel to the movie if you know the book.”</p>\n<p>Amidst their journey, the aviator and the prince encounter characters on different planets, including a Rose (Marion Cotillard) who becomes the affection of the Little Prince, a Snake (Benicio Del Toro) who is sly and cunning and a Fox (James Franco) who yearns to be tamed. In order for the prince to return to his planet, he must sacrifice himself by being bitten by the snake. Deeply enthralled and upset by the ending of the adventure, the Little Girl sets out to rewrite the story; she decides to find the prince (where he is now an adult working tirelessly away), returns him to his planet and helps him become the young boy he was once again. She eventually finishes the story for the aviator, and together with her mother, the two develop a greater, loving relationship with the help of the story of the Little Prince.</p>\n<p>For director Mark Osborne, the film was a family affair (his son Riley voiced The Little Prince).</p>\n<p>“I first read it when I was about 20 — my wife gave me her copy of the book,” Osborne said. “We weren’t married at that point, but we were just dating and now we’re married with two kids … the book really became a part of our life together, a part of our relationship.”</p>\n<p>As for Riley Osborne, being the voice of the Little Prince was nothing more than a day at work with dad.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of like hanging out with my dad.

Making SBIFF history, Larson called in via Skype to recount her history as an actress.</p>\n<p>“I started auditioning when I was six or seven years old,” she said. “Been at this for about 20 [years]. It’s been a very long road, but I wouldn’t want it to be any different. I wouldn’t change it — it brings me closer to who I am.”</p>\n<p>After a year of acting in plays, her mother got her an agent and she started appearing in fake commercials for Jay Leno.</p>\n<p>Larson got her first big break in “The United States of Tara” as Kate Gregson, a role she was initially rejected for. “It set me on my path,” she said. She would go on to co-star in “21 Jump Street,” “Short Term 12” and “Room,” the film she was awarded for.</p>\n<p>For her role as Ma, a woman kept captive with her son in a shed for seven years, Larson lost fat and gained muscle and consulted with a trauma specialist. She described how she and discovered the film on an emotional level as shooting went on. Like her character’s son Jack, she ended up missing the warm security of “Room” after the crew moved out into the chilly cityscape of Toronto.</p>\n<p>Larson graciously accepted her Outstanding Performer of the Year Award before leaving the call to catch her plane.</p>\n<p>Then, Saoirse Ronan, clad in white, walked onstage with a box of popcorn. As she sat down, she said, “I just realized Brie and I are wearing the same dress,” much to the audience’s amusement.</p>\n<p>The actress, famed for “Atonement” and “The Host,” was awarded for the romantic drama “Brooklyn” — which is where she was born, according to the moderator.</p>\n<p>Not so, Ronan corrects him: she came from the Bronx. “Obviously. Clearly I was born in the Bronx. Could you not tell by my sassy attitude?”</p>\n<p>Like her character Eilis Lacy, Ronan’s parents were Irish immigrants. Her mother worked as a nanny and her father worked a variety of jobs, including actor, bartender and construction worker.</p>\n<p>One of her first acting gigs came when her father cast her in a surrealist short film. “I started acting when I was very young. Being exposed to a group of young, creative people who interacted with me when I was a kid inspired me to be like them.”</p>\n<p>Ronan’s early experience made her adept at accents, which she demonstrated to the audience by adopting typical Valley Girl twang. She would go on to star in “Atonement” alongside Keira Knightley, which earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>She later played the teenage assassin Hanna in the film of the same name. Ronan recounted doing weightlifting and practicing martial arts for the role. A clip played, showing her killing Michelle Dockery’s character. “I snapped Lady Mary’s neck,” she tells a laughing audience. “So sorry.”</p>\n<p>For “Brooklyn,” Ronan was able to deeply sympathize with her character. She eventually moved away from her family to live in London and became very homesick.</p>\n<p>“There was a part in a movie when I tell Jim Broadbent ‘I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.’ I know that feeling … everyone’s come from someplace else. We need to make that first step out the front door, and it’s frightening.”</p>\n<p>Then event concluded with SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling taking the stage to sing the praises of Ronan, causing her to tear up as she graciously accepted her golden trophy.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point of taking a photo now, my makeup’s ruined. It’s important me to remember how important the work is and how important it is to make film and stories on stage or a film set. It’s what I love to do, and I get to work with wonderful people. Thanks for listening to us go on for the last hour. I hope you have a nice night, and thank you for coming.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

beginning to worry that Johnny Depp might not show up to collect his Maltin Modern Master award from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. A no-show would have been uncharacteristic of someone who Scott Cooper, the director of Depp’s latest film “Black Mass,” described as “one of the kindest, most soulful, most generous men that [he knows],” and true to form, Depp eventually arrived. Depp was rushed past reporters and into the Arlington Theatre by his handlers, although he made an attempt to answer a few questions along the way.</p>\n<p>This effort on his part was surprising since, as Leonard Maltin, the film critic for whom the award is now named, pointed out at the start of the evening, Depp is notorious for avoiding press. “People have said in the past week or so: ‘Johnny Depp doesn’t do things like this,’ which he doesn’t,” Maltin said, although even without this observation, it would have been obvious to most people in the audience. Depp was visibly nervous and fidgeted throughout the evening with his rings, hair, sunglasses and, most notably, his black and white HUF Plantlife socks. For much of the first portion of the interview, he stared down at his hands, peering sideways at Maltin or up at the audience to see if one of his numerous jokes got the right reaction.</p>\n<p>For the most part they did, although some of his more bizarre jokes were lost on Maltin, and this seemed to boost his confidence. By the time Maltin and Depp were halfway through their hour-and-a-half long interview, Depp’s body language had opened up. He was looking at and interacting with the audience more, affectionately imitating former co-stars and, on two occasions, gesturing so enthusiastically that he knocked his own microphone. Depp even joked, un-annoyed, with the one bizarre heckler of the evening, who told the actor to “grow more things.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I grow things,” Depp said, adding, “Might not be the same things that you’re growing,” although his socks implied otherwise.</p>\n<p>This was in contrast to Maltin, who stayed in almost the same rapt position throughout the interview and seemed a bit awestruck by Depp. He didn’t interject often, content to listen to Depp’s rambling, often inconclusive but entertaining stories and, when he did interrupt, it was to introduce one of the many movie clips that interspersed their conversation or to prod Depp for the end of a sentence. It’s possible that Depp could have used a bit more prodding, however, since the event went on so long that some people started leaving and at least one woman fell asleep in her seat. This could also have had something to do with the sheer number of movies Depp has in his repertoire — over 40 at this point — and Maltin even apologised at the start they could not show clips from all of his works.</p>\n<p>Clearly Depp shared the opinion that the interview went on too long, though, since he started rolling a cigarette about forty minutes in and had it in his hand until the end. He may have lost his initial shyness and expressed sincere gratitude that he was “lucky enough to meet [his fans] outside and across the globe” but it remained obvious that he dislikes press and the general trappings of fame. He apologized for his awkwardness at the end, saying “I’m not good at this stuff … Stuttering and stammering — I don’t know, they haven’t really diagnosed it yet,” and mentioned being disguised with prosthetics in order to “take his kids to the London Eye without people looking at [him like he’s] Johnny Depp.”</p>\n<p>Still, Depp’s assessment that he is not good at interviews was perhaps too self-critical. Over 90 minutes he walked the audience through his entire career, starting with his stint as a TV actor on “21 Jump Street,” right up to the present day. He related how unhappy he was acting for TV, “where you can only play one character for a long period of time” and end up “being a product,” along with the bizarre ways he tried to get fired, including refusing to remove a turban or inventing a peanut butter obsession for his character. He went on the describe his “instant” connection and three-hour-long conversation with Tim Burton, after seeing him at the coffee shop where they had agreed to meet “with his hair looking like there was an explosion at a hardware store and … chewing on his coffee spoon. I walk into a joint, I know that’s the guy I’m talking to,” Depp said of the encounter, “Even if it’s not Tim Burton.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Depp had glowing things to say about everyone he has worked with and even his insistence that Al Pacino is “certifiably insane” was more loving than not. He was particularly emotional about the late Marlon Brando, whom he described as “a hero, a father, a mentor, a brother and a friend.” He again demonstrated his distaste at some aspects of the industry, though, when describing how his agent received a call after his friend’s death, asking if he now wanted to release “The Brave,” the movie he had produced and starred in with Brando some years earlier. Depp was disgusted at this attempt to have Brando “exploited and looked upon as a freak or some novelty,” a sentiment that merited a lot of applause from the audience. That said, the film’s abysmal reception when it premiered at Cannes could also have contributed to this decision, although Depp clearly isn’t afraid of making mistakes and claimed at the end that the possibility that “[he] could fall flat on [his] face” is a vital part of being an actor.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the event made clear that Johnny Depp has not only achieved a staggering amount of success but has also done a lot to earn it, including trying to contract heat stroke to perfect the reeling swagger of Captain Jack Sparrow. He remained humble, however, making constant references to the hard work of his agent of 30 years, Tracy, and avoided any hints of pretentiousness. He was particularly flippant about method actors, who he envisaged “at the craft table refusing to eat those Doritos because [they’re] Henry the Eighth,” and said that he knows he’ll see them “in the bar later, because [they’ve] got more problems than [he does].”</p>\n<p>A similar humility was displayed by Leonard Maltin who, though not an international film star, had reason to think highly of himself, since it was his first time conducting the Modern Master interview since the award was renamed in his honour and he was described by Mark Scher, the president of SBIFF, as a “rockstar.” Maltin, though, attributed his success as a film critic to having “broke in at the right time” when it was still possible to become established through “old school print journalism,” stating that he “wouldn’t want to be breaking in today … [since] the internet’s changed everything.” Maltin arrived at the red carpet with his daughter as his date and was affable and eager to talk to everyone, which was probably why he got on well with Depp, who could be seen leaning over to talk to him while the film clips were playing.</p>\n<p>The interview ended with Black Mass director Scott Cooper appearing on stage to heap more compliments on Depp, who bashfully deflected these by making the “make it rain” gesture after being called generous. Depp, having accepted his award, said he was “lucky to get away with everything [he] got away with over the years” and focused on the “talent … [and] brilliance of men like Leonard Maltin.” Cooper, however, who said he’d “travelled the world espousing the virtues of Johnny Depp,” insisted that “there really is no one like Johnny” and called him “the most overlooked actor of the year” in reference to his Oscar snub. From the response this got from a, by that point, very tired audience, it was clear they agreed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68124\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68124\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/","id":5867,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[5866,5865,5864],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Citizen Cope to Bring the Love at SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/citizen-cope.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/citizen-cope.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This Friday at 9 p.m., Feb. 12 at SOhO, love will certainly be in the air, in the form of a soulful acoustic performance by none other than Citizen Cope.

The singer/guitarist/songwriter will be performing his most recently released compilation, “With Love From Citizen Cope.” The compilation’s subtitle, “An Intimate Solo/Acoustic Valentine’s Performance,” aptly named, will prepare club-goers for Valentine’s Day weekend. No matter the occasion, Cope is sure to deliver.</p>\n<p>With a career spanning over a few decades since the nineties, Citizen Cope has released five albums through a variety of different labels including Capitol Records. Throughout his expansive career, Citizen Cope developed as a musician and producer synthesizing acoustic guitar rhythms with hip hop beats. His works confront a wide variety of topics, such as the American Dream, to the concept of love itself. Listening to Cope, one discovers the narrative quality in each of his tracks — not only from his lyrics but also the musical arrangements found within.</p>\n<p>When you think of the quintessential “American” sound, one would suggest a track or discography from the day’s latest pop act. However, what is the sound, culturally, of the United States? A rhythm and beat that resonates with people from every level of society, whether rich or poor, white or black, the business guru, the garbage man, a broken heart, a budding romance. The list is essentially endless. Sure, we have a knack of churning out the next banger whose sole purpose is to remind its listeners about the next round of drinks, taking us away from the truth of reality.

When listening to Citizen’s discography, you find hints of an acoustic folk tone, reminiscent of Bob Dylan or Neil Young. Tracks like “Bullet And a Target” channel drum machines from the earlier days of hip hop. The main takeaway illustrates Citizen Cope’s ability to take a variety of influences and make them his own. His greatest ability is putting soul back into what one would consider “acoustic rock” while also being innovative.</p>\n<p>Clarence Greenwood will be stopping by Santa Barbara along his extensive tour throughout California. The show is 21+. Tickets are $36 and the show starts at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMy8lKG6Atc</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/citizen-cope-to-bring-the-love-at-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/citizen-cope-to-bring-the-love-at-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/citizen-cope-to-bring-the-love-at-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/citizen-cope-to-bring-the-love-at-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/citizen-cope-to-bring-the-love-at-soho/","id":6832,"author":{"id":724,"name":"Vincent Beck"},"related":[6831,6830,6829],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zion-I To Take On Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/zion-i-4WEB.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/zion-i-4WEB.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The duo of MC Zumbi and DJ AmpLive traffic in genre influences.

Their name is rightly suggestive of reggae sounds, but their style ranges farther than that. Zion I embodies the classic hip-hop pair of MC and DJ/producer, and classic hip-hop manifests in their music. That influence — along with a half dozen others from trance to drum’n’bass — makes the duo a unique force in the hip-hop world.</p>\n<p>While originally hailing from Oakland, Zumbi and AmpLive met in Atlanta. Surely enough, their style suggests both southern rap and Bay Area sounds. Zion I began by opening for acts like De La Soul and Run D.M.C. The group’s work dates back to the mid-90s and since then their output has been prolific. Boasting quite a few studio albums, collaboration albums and EPs, Zion I endures, continually producing music where others might quit. Most known for their single “Coastin’” featuring alternative vocalist K. Flay, the group remains a mainstay of the underground and alternative hip-hop scenes. Most recently they released a live album dubbed “The Rapture: Live from Oaklandia.”</p>\n<p>Aside from a potpourri of musical influences, Zion I is also noteworthy for their spiritual vibes. The electronic beats underlying much of their rap exhibit a mystical quality. The group’s instrumentals often feature soulful piano or acoustic sounds as well, and their lyrics typically voice appeals to hope and spiritual unity. A visit to Zion I’s Instagram page reveals a slew of positive-thinking Zen mottos such as “peace is within” and “family is strength.” One image even features DJ Zumbi hard at work mastering Yang Tai Qi movements.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Zion I’s music is available on both Spotify and Bandcamp. They will be at Velvet Jones this Friday, Feb. 12 at 8:00 p.m. Opening are the Panamanian hip-hop/reggaeton duo Los Rakas and West Coast rapper Locksmith. Los Rakas feature a multitude of genre influences as well, and they take their name from the Central American insult “Rakataka” (essentially hoodrat). While Los Rakas come from the streets, they’ve matured into a quickly-growing band, appearing on cultural touchstones like FIFA 2014 and NPR. Locksmith meanwhile remains an underground sensation, building an audience through word-of-mouth and play on West Coast hip-hop radio stations.</p>\n<p>The show at Velvet Jones promises to be essential for any devotees of the alternative hip-hop scene, or anyone who enjoys a well-crafted beat.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI2L7U5n0LI</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

roll blasting through speakers, flashing multicolored lights and densely packed students jumping in every direction made Thursday night’s Battle of the Bands a beacon of excitement amongst a quiet campus. UCSB students escaped the looming threat of midterms for a few hours and rocked out to some of Isla Vista’s local bands at the Hub. The Associated Students-sponsored event gave five bands the chance to compete for a grand prize: a professionally recorded music video created by UCSB Amplified.</p>\n<p>Students migrated from the beer garden to the crowd in front of the stage as the first band, Feral Vida, took the stage. Their friendly smiles were met with shouts of “Feral Vida!” from the growing mass of people. The band kept the cheers going with an upbeat tempo and Augie Houlemard’s loud, raspy vocals that filled the room. Both guitarists demonstrated their dexterity during their cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” with long guitar riffs and drawn-out high notes. Feral Vida got the crowd jumping and ready for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>With a steady beat and mellow sound, Frisson created a more relaxed atmosphere. The slow guitar picking and lower vocals in their first few songs got the crowd swaying and nodding their heads to the beat. Many students made their way back to the beer garden to tap along from the comfort of their seats. The band picked up the pace later in the set with a fast beat and head banging that brought people back to the dance floor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kaitlyn Haberlin, smiling and wide-eyed, remarked, “The first two acts were really cool. I’m surprised at the skill and ability they have as artists. They’re super awesome and fun and they get the crowd excited.”</p>\n<p>Savage Henry took the stage next, their sense of fun and humor revealed before they even began to play. They danced to the intermission music while onstage and playfully pointed their guitars at the audience. The set began with a chest-pounding beat and Wilder Kehke’s high, vibrato-filled voice. The sudden quickening of the drums and loud guitar chords incited mosh pits and crowd surfing as the two guitarists played face-to-face onstage. The lively group finished their set with a clash of smashing drums, squealing guitar and sweeping keyboard in an epic climax.</p>\n<p>Sanders Circus came off strong from the start with loud, grainy electric guitar and calls of “Are you ready?” from guitarist and vocalist David Kuperman. During their cover of “Purple Haze,” Kuperman took the spotlight, dropping to his knees dramatically as he played. His guitar riffs played from behind his head sent the crowd into a frenzy while bassist Joe Barnes gave each song a full sound with funky bass solos. John Pagliassotti, a member of Savage Henry, said of Sanders Circus, “Oh yeah, these guys can really wail.” Lights flashed rapidly as the band finished with a flourish of cymbals.</p>\n<p>From smooth, harmonious guitar to quick bursts of drums and bass, The Don’ts demonstrated their skill and versatility while the crowd chanted their name. Clear, lingering high notes and sliding guitar from both guitarists, Blake Elliot and Ben Seilhamer, created a dynamic sound. Smooth bass and mellow vocals from Mitchell Solkov quickly became a jarring blast of guitar and throaty belting as the song picked up in tempo. Multiple guitar solos and lightning-fast riffing from the two guitarists left the crowd cheering once again.</p>\n<p>The Hub erupted in applause when Savage Henry, the winning band, took the stage. Kehke, all smiles, humbly approached the microphone, calling out to the audience, “Thank you for supporting our band, and supporting all the bands here tonight!” When asked about their performance, Pagliassotti replied, “It was great. We practiced this set like 10 times in the last week, so it was so easy to play the music that you just focus on having fun.” Drummer Will Hettel remarked with a laugh, “To put things in perspective we pretty much never practice, so it was a change in pace.”</p>\n<p>The Battle of the Bands was a clear demonstration of the flourishing arts and music in I.V. Each band brought a unique aspect of performance to the stage, whether in their music or in the way they had fun onstage. With many different styles, personalities and talents, students experienced a night filled with variety all with the classic sound of rock and roll.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/","id":6795,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6794,6793,6792],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":32,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
