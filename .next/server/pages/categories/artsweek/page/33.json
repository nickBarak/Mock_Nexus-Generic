The event was put together as a collaborative effort between the Chainsmokers and a new app called Tilt. Campuses were challenged to pre-sell 800 tickets and the first six schools to do so won a spot on the Tilt Tour. The headliner of the show wasn’t announced until 24 hours before tickets went on sale. UCSB managed to sell out the first round of tickets in less than an hour and half, and the second release in under a minute.</p>\n<p>Tilt is an app that makes it easy to collect money without all the hassle. Basically, a user starts a Tilt campaign with a set “Tilt amount.” Others donate whatever sum they choose, but nobody gets charged until the goal is hit. It’s like Venmo on a Costco-sized scale. The appeal to college campuses is obvious. Whether it’s a party, a trip, philanthropy or day-to-day housing costs, Tilt can make any type of organizing as smooth as can be. Overall, this Tilt campaign managed to sell more than 4,800 tickets in less than two hours, a clear example of the app’s accessibility and efficiency.</p>\n<p>The event itself was a huge success. The crowd managed to fill up the hall regardless of the early show time. Set times were strictly adhered to, and security was very efficient. The opening act vibed well with the excitement of the audience and paved the way for the headliner. Austin Graham, fourth-year chemical engineering major, told me he’s seen The Chainsmokers more times than he can count, but “they still manage to get me ridiculously hyped every time.” During the set another concert go-er, fourth-year economics major Chris Mulvihill, told me that he’s “so glad he skipped studying to come see this event.” Chainsmokers over midterms erryday, amirite?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crowd-funding concerts and tours might be the future of how artists tour. Earlier this year, <em>The New York Times </em>published an article discussing the feasibility of saving musicians revenue with the emergence of prominent streaming services such as Spotify or SoundCloud. A cost of touring that is often overlooked is the wear and tear such a hectic schedule takes on the artists themselves. <em>The New York Times </em>discusses how unsustainable of a business model touring is for artists, especially when record label contracts are considered. Record labels use artist’s independent contractor statuses to release themselves from liabilities pertaining to the well-being of the artist.</p>\n<p>The changes happening in the music industry force artists to adapt. In an interview with <em>The Rolling Stone</em>, Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl said that crowd funding might be the future of how artists plan their tours. The Foo Fighters had to cancel a huge part of their 2015 tour due to an injury Grohl sustained while performing. <em>The New York Times </em>reports that the canceled shows cost the band about $10 million — a sum that is very difficult to recover. An alternative needs to be found to sustain the music industry. The Chainsmokers see things similarly. The duo told Tilt, “We are seeing so much innovation nowadays, and we don’t think the way people attend concerts is any different. As artists especially, we want to go to the markets we have the most demand.”</p>\n<p>Another reason The Chainsmokers might have been attracted to Tilt could be how both Tilt and the dynamic duo relate to fans. Tilt works solely on fan involvement, and The Chainsmokers are known for creating a close relationship with their fan base. They almost always join the after party, discuss fan encounters on their Sirius XM show “Nice Hair” and are known to retweet and respond to fans online. Oh, and we can’t forget their beautiful puppy, Cheddar. (Follow him on Insta @cheddarsaycheese. Seriously. You won’t regret it.) For artists like The Chainsmokers, a form of touring that cuts out the middleman is clearly superior to the old school touring model.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the emergences of crowd funding changes the way artists do what they do. The possibilities are endless.

The company is always looking for more campus reps to make a small goal a reality.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGVMZ7OgzTU</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/","id":6793,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6792,6791,6790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Autograf To Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3899360.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3899360.jpeg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Future house group Autograf will be taking over SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on Feb. 11.

The group is comprised of Chicago natives Jake Carpenter, Louis Kha and Mikul Wing. The three members all hail from unique backgrounds that we don’t always see in the EDM world. Carpenter has an educational background in sculpting and painting with a work history that involves weapons development and underwater robotics for the Department of Defense in Kentucky. Kha worked as a derivatives trader during the workweek and a DJ on the weekends with Wing. Wing did street art and deejayed a lot of underground loft parties. The three came together about a year ago over a mutual love for all things art and discontent with their day-to-day routines.</p>\n<p>The group’s first project together was a recreation of Warhol’s factory concept with their own personal spin. They built sculptures and created a broiler room-esque atmosphere for the event. Manufacturing their own genre, set and effects is something the group is determined to keep doing. Following their first project together, the group released a string of remixes of hits that range all the way from Marvin Gaye’s “Grapevine” to 50 Cent and Lil Kim’s “Magic Stick.” Their first single, “Dream,” released about a year ago, has 2.53 million hits on SoundCloud and paved the way for the group to continue releasing original content.</p>\n<p>Autograf dropped their single “Future Soup” a couple days ago. The track is from their EP, also titled <em>Future Soup, </em>which is set to release independently on Mar. 11. In an interview with <em>Billboard</em>, Autograf said, “<em>Future Soup</em> is our calling to everyone to weave their own story, to make their own metaphorical art series, whatever that may be.” It is a continuation of the trio’s attempts at creating their own sound that sets them apart from the rest of the future house movement. They hope to break away from the mainstream sounds prominent in the EDM genre. The entire Autograf project is geared around the hashtag “#leaveyourmark,” and the slogan, “It’s about leaving your mark on the world.

The film tells the story of the rescue of the S.S. Pendleton, one of the most daring rescue missions in the history of the Coast Guard. When the ship is split in two by a ferocious storm off the coast of Chatham, MA, coxswain Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) sets out in a lifeboat in extremely treacherous conditions to rescue the survivors. Thanks to the efforts of Webber and chief engineer Raymond Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), 32 out of 33 of the Pendleton’s crew members were rescued.

What exactly is it that draws you back to your hometown, and how did your familiarity with the area affect the filming process?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> That’s a good question. I guess I like coming back here just because I’m from here. It’s nice to come home. I’m in California for the time being so I can work; that’s where the industry is. But I’d much rather be here. Boston is also a great place to make movies ‘cause they’ve been making movies here for a long time. They’ve got really good crews there, which is not always the case. And you know, everyone’s professional, and also when the movie comes out and you run into the people who you made it with from Boston, people in Boston don’t mind telling you if they hated it. So it’s nice to know, you know, where you stand. And you don’t have to guess about whether or not they actually liked it or not. That was a joke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Growing up in Boston, were you familiar with the story of the Pendleton’s rescue before your experience with the film?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> I hadn’t heard it before. I’m not totally sure that it’s true. But they say it is, you know, and I guess that’s enough to make a movie, you know. When I — when I did a little research, I was skeptical. I went to the Coast Guard Museum and turns out it all really happened. It’s quite an amazing story. It’s great when you can find totally forgotten [stories] like this that really you could write a book about. You could bring cheer to the story in a lot of ways. But these days, movies are pretty great for making a spectacle, you know. All the amazing things that they can do now in movies. They can really bring something like this to life, the scale of which would be hard to imagine if it weren’t a movie. No matter how much I heard about it or read about it, I was still really surprised by how big the ship was and, you know, just like what that — to think how big those waves must have been to split a 500 foot Oil Tanker in half. It’s the kind of thing you want to see someone make a movie of so you can go watch it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Hey, I just wanted to know how the film being set in 1952, how that changed your approach to the performance?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> Well that’s a good question. There’s a lot of conversation about whether or not we try to emulate the style — the acting style — the movies from that period, because stylistically the movie looks and feels a lot like a movie from back then, albeit also sort of, you know, color and gigantic and sort of awesome in all of the ways that digital cinema is now. But in other ways, in the writing and storytelling, thematically, it sort of feels like an old movie. So should people behave that way as well? And we decided no. So really I just approach it like any other movie the as best you can.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Chris, you play Bernard Weber, who’s the main character of this film. What elements did you bring to your character to honor Weber’s legacy?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Bernie Weber … what I like about Bernie, at least from the script that I was given and — I didn’t know Bernie and really had only a sense of who he was from talking to Andy Fitzgerald, who was on the boat with him that night, and Moe Gutthrew, who’s his best friend, and there’s an autobiographical account that Bernie wrote about the night, and then obviously the book <em>The Finest </em>and a little audio clip of Bernie describing the events of that night. So that was — those were kind of the things that I used to cull an idea of who the man might have been. But from the script that I was given, he was a simple guy that loved his job and loved the waters … and knew what he was doing out there but was obviously affected by a tragedy that happened a year before and didn’t know if he was up for the task of going out that night. But I … do love the idea of a regular man up against seemingly insurmountable odds, and more than anything, I kind of related to Bernie’s fear, you know. Bernie is a man that wears his heart on his sleeve. And he’s not like many of us that, you know, put on all this armor and try to be macho and tough. He’s just — Bernie doesn’t — at least from the script that was given — doesn’t think that way. He just kind of wears his heart on his sleeve, wants to do a good job and loves his wife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Bernie’s character was a really huge rule follower in the film at the beginning. And then at the end, he kind of learned the limits of being a rule follower and kind of broke away from that. Were there any situations in your life where you have broken the rules or taken risks in acting or in life?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Nothing that comes to mind. But that seems to be that theme of, you know, we all like stories of the mavericks and the guys that, I don’t know, go against the grain, and I think what we enjoy about men like that is they usually operate from the sense of an inner moral compass. And I think part of Bernie’s evolution — it’s not that following rules are bad, it’s just that Bernie, by following rules so closely, had lost his voice, and by learning to speak up for himself and to trust his instincts, trust his gut, trust his knowledge of those waters, I think — I think that’s really good.

Spittle flies from his mouth in unnatural fashion, and his eyes glaze over in response to the innumerable traumas he is forced to experience.</p>\n<p>You can tell that DiCaprio physically and emotionally committed himself to this role to the point of being uncomfortable. Many are saying this performance will finally win Leo his Oscar. I’d say it’s entirely possible, as his performance doesn’t just convey a battered yet determined man, but does so in a completely compelling way. Hugh Glass is not a particularly layered character, but he is, without a doubt, engrossing to watch.</p>\n<p>And speaking of engrossing, you ought to see what is captured in-frame. The scenery of Midwestern America is so finely captured and immersive that if snow had started to trickle into the theater, I wouldn’t have batted an eye.</p>\n<p>Like “The Martian,” the film’s wide shots expertly and wordlessly convey how stacked the odds are against the protagonist. He is a dot against a vast, overwhelming landscape of snow and towering forests. Once you see shots like this, they go so far as to add to Glass’s character by making you realize just how determined he really is.</p>\n<p>Also, if “Birdman” (I’m not writing out the subtitle for that thing) taught us anything, it’s that director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, are masters of the long take. Unlike “Birdman,” the movie isn’t made to a look like it was done in one shot, but it is peppered with enough extended takes to evoke the feeling of a physical, theatrical production. They also forgo the eye-gougingly annoying cliché of shaking the camera during the action; everything you see is as clear as the icy rivers Glass drinks from.</p>\n<p>But if you’ll allow me to be blunt for a moment, let me say this: This film is fucking brutal. Nothing in this film is easy to swallow — not the introductory slaughter, not the mauling, not when Glass treats himself.</p>\n<p>The on-screen violence succeeds in shocking you not by becoming over-the-top to the point of hilarity like a Tarantino film, but by being unforgivingly, viscerally authentic. If you have a weak stomach and still want to see large bear fights, “Kung Fu Panda 3” just came out.</p>\n<p>So, I don’t know if I’ll see this again any time soon. “The Revenant” is undoubtedly in a master-class of filmmaking, but its on-screen violence is certainly not for the faint-hearted. Those easily offended might opt for something lighter, like maybe “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” Kidding. Here’s hoping a golden statuette finally lands in DiCaprio’s lap.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/","id":5900,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5899,5898,5897],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Room’ Leaves Viewers Heartbroken","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Like many of the other astounding independent films that debuted in 2015, “Room” failed to gain attention prior to its release.

Despite the setback, the movie has managed to gather the attention of audiences across the world.</p>\n<p>In the past, director Larry Abrahamson’s films have failed to gain said attention; nevertheless, the film, “Room,” continues to receive acclamation from critics. Abrahamson developed his film from Emma Donoghue’s novel, <em>Room</em>. When writing the film Donoghue was hesitant about the novel’s on-screen biopic, afraid that it would simply be “a really soppy movie or pervy, grim, voyeuristic one.” Nonetheless, the film was electrifying, leading fans to experience a whirlwind of emotions.</p>\n<p>The movie stars Brie Larson as “Ma” and Jacob Tremblay as Jack, both of which have been presented with prestigious awards for their spectacular performances in <em>Room</em>. As Jack — an easily impressed five-year-old boy — speaks in amazement during the opening scene, the audience is shown scenes of him running around in amusement confined to a 10-by-10-foot room. Their lifestyle is introduced as being filled with tiresome habits, which becomes evident in seeing that Jack and Ma never leave the condemned area. However, the tone of the film shifts as it reveals that both Ma and Jack have been placed in this room due to a horrific nightmare scenario, causing the audience to embark on a journey filled with despair. Although this may appear to be a vital part of the plot, it pales in comparison to what the rest of the film has to offer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While in captivation, the protagonists develop a schedule that leads a young and vulnerable Jack to believe that he is in a safe environment. His imagination engrosses him in a make-believe world that has made him oblivious to the fact that his mother is living a life filled with sorrow. Furthermore, Jack’s narrow-minded habits manage to make the audience frustrated as they see he is incapable of handling the horrific reality he lives in; and yet, it is up to him to save what is left of his mother’s life. Although the film consists of a rather depressing plot,</p>\n<p>Every scene is indispensable, essential for the next, constantly leaving the audience questioning what will follow. As the film progresses, the audience is forced to separate from a setting, which has constructed a relationship with the viewers. The room is not only a place, but rather a significant part in the lives of both Ma and Jack. Throughout the entire movie, it is referred to as “room,” personifying it as if it were a name with feelings and memories attached to it, rather than simply being a place. Regardless of the fact that the setting changes drastically, the mood only escalates to breathtaking scenes, showing that Ma is suffering a mental breakdown triggered by leading a life filled with vile experiences.</p>\n<p>It is always difficult to believe that what goes on in movies can even come close to being slightly real. “Room” unravels an all-too-realistic situation filled with dire conditions, leading the audience to empathize with those that have to endure a situation similar to the one Ma and Jack faced. Viewers are guaranteed to have an epiphany sparked by the realism that is painted by Abrahamson. Room itself may be small, but the imprint it leaves is enormous.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/","id":5899,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[5898,5897,5896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Exclusive Interview: Robby Hauldren of Louis The Child","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Louis-The-Child-ill-Methodology_1-800x400.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Louis-The-Child-ill-Methodology_1-800x400.png?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Dressed in a light pink sweatshirt underneath the warmth of a Northface jacket, Robby Hauldren, one half of the up-and-coming electronic DJ duo Louis the Child, met up to chat with Artsweek.

Born and raised in the windy city of Chicago, Hauldren and his band mate Freddy Kennett started making music when they were teenagers in high school. “Freddy was making dubstep under the name ‘Fatboy,’” the Illinois native explained. “I was making mashups under the name ‘Hall Pass’ because my last name’s Haudren.”</p>\n<p>At chance meeting at a Madeon concert, the two boys became fast friends. After learning that they shared the same interest in electronic music, the new acquaintances decided to work together. By the time the aspiring artists made some real music, the two began to gain support from friends on Facebook, leading them to hire a manager who encouraged the young DJs to send their music to various online blogs. From then on, listeners on SoundCloud built huge support for the boys. With thousands of plays on their remixes, famed EDM artists such as Madeon and The Chainsmokers noticed the DJ-ing duo and asked the two to open for them on their tours.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy because this past year, we toured with Madeon in the spring and fall. The whole ‘come full circle’ was like, we met at a Madeon concert and we got to go on tour with him.” Hauldren shared about his experience with famed EDM artist, “He has helped us out so much with incredible advice. He’s one of those people who [is] a very genuine artist who cares a lot about his craft. It’s good to get advice from him of all people.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 19-year-old Hauldren is currently a student at University of Southern California. Kennett, who’s a year younger, plans to join his friend in Los Angeles after graduating high school this forthcoming June. Balancing being a DJ and a student simultaneously does not seem to bother the college sophomore.</p>\n<p>“I’m a student during the week and a DJ on the weekends. Every weekend on Fridays, I fly out, and Sundays, I come back and find time for my studies,” Hauldren shared.</p>\n<p>Even with a network of fans all around the world, the young music producer is shocked at the amount of recognition at his school. “I was very pleasantly surprised at going to school and meeting a lot of kids who already knew my music. It’s really eye-opening because, back in my high school, kids know my music because I go to school with them,” the USC student said. “And then to go somewhere completely different and see that all these kids from these different places also know your music and know all of our friends’ music is crazy.”</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2015, Louis the Child dropped their first original record, “It’s Strange (ft. K Flay).” The song was immediately played by millions of listeners and became a critical success. One notable fan was pop music sensation Taylor Swift, who recently shared an Instagram photo of a list of her current music obsessions. The last song on the list was none other than the duo’s debut record.</p>\n<p>“It like still hasn’t hit me. Even the fact that the thought that she even heard of our song — just that it’s gone through her ears — is crazy in itself, but then she likes it enough herself to say, like, ‘Hey, I want other people to hear this and I think it’s a song that will make your life more awesome,’ is the craziest thing,” Hauldren said.</p>\n<p>For the young artist, 2015 was the beginning of many achievements. “Overall, the success of ‘It’s Strange’ — none of us expected it to do as well as it did and it’s crazy the support that it’s gotten from our friends at blogs and our other DJ friends, and Taylor Swift and Lorde tweeting out about it. I’d say ‘It’s Strange’ is a huge highlight of 2015.” As for the coming year, the music producer is looking forward to possibly releasing a debut EP. “We got a lot more touring. We got a lot of really, really big, good festivals booked up right now that I’m super excited about,” the Chicago native shared. “We’re trying to get out an EP as soon as possible within the next couple months, so definitely an EP in early 2016 and a lot of touring and festivals.”</p>\n<p>With a headlining feature at SnowGlobe under his belt and a future performance at Coachella in the spring, Robby Hauldren is enjoying his newfound success with his best friend. Louis The Child is regarded as one of the electronic DJs to watch, and it’s just a matter of time before the two Chicago boys will be headlining sold out festivals all around the world.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67856\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/exclusive-interview-robby-hauldren-of-louis-the-child/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67856\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/exclusive-interview-robby-hauldren-of-louis-the-child/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/exclusive-interview-robby-hauldren-of-louis-the-child/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/exclusive-interview-robby-hauldren-of-louis-the-child/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/exclusive-interview-robby-hauldren-of-louis-the-child/","id":6826,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6825,6824,6823],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hood Internet to Mash Up SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/0000220849_10-e1454300724211.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/0000220849_10-e1454300724211.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1","description":"At 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 4, an unprecedented event in the universe will be happening in downtown Santa Barbara.

Stars will be colliding one after another after another, putting SOhO’s structural integrity to the test. Mashup masters The Hood Internet will be pitting Kendrick Lamar vs. Taylor Swift, Hall and Oates vs. Daft Punk, Mac DeMarco vs. Nas and a variety of other unlikely nemeses in a groove-filled jam-off of cosmic proportions.</p>\n<p>ABX and STV SLV (Steve Sleeve), also known by their earthling names Aaron Brink and Steve Reidell, are the two Chicago-based mixmasters who comprise the act. The duo is known for their ability to find unexpectedly complementary artists and blend them into a beautiful beast of their own design. The group is a proverbial Dr. Victor Frankenstein of the music world and, similar to Frankenstein’s monster, every townsperson is up in arms about what they’ve created — only this time, the arms hold glowsticks and flasks, not torches and pitchforks.</p>\n<p>Since 2007, The Hood Internet has released one studio album and 10 mixtapes, a fact that speaks to the group’s modus operandi: mashing. Their catalog of music therefore consists almost wholly of mashups with a sparse representation of their own music worked in. At SOhO, attendees can depend on the pair to play the crowd favorites: a cross between R. Kelly’s “Ignition” and Phoenix’s “1901,” a synthesis of Justin Timberlake’s “Suit and Tie” and Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” and their original song “Won’t Fuck Us Over.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from dicing up pop hits and touring the nation, the group also runs a blog, aptly named <em><a href=\"http://thehoodinternet.com/\">thehoodinternet.com</a></em><em>.</em> This, along with their SoundCloud, is where they release their music and keep fans updated. They are also the creators and administrators of <em><a href=\"http://albumtacos.tumblr.com/\">albumtacos.tumblr.com</a></em>, a popular board in which users input album covers with tacos and assorted fast foods photoshopped into the artwork.

They even mixed the music for the most recent Youtube Rewind (link: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK9bwTlAvgo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK9bwTlAvgo</a>), the video anthem to this entire culture-combo.</p>\n<p>The group will be coming off a few days of rest and nearing a close to their Western U.S. tour when they make it to Santa Barbara.

He wears a loose-fitting, colorful button-down. I speak with his mother, Sherry Mandell, about the organic produce company she works for. Her son belts out: “This place seems sober as fuck!” Between songs, he calls out to the audience. “Who fucked up this week? Raise your hand if you fucked up this week. If you’re not raising your hand, you’re lying.” I wonder if he includes his mother in this. He is the lead vocalist for the band Pookie, the first warm-up act for Metalachi. In case anyone needed clearing up on the band’s title, the man whose mother is in the audience clarifies. “Pookie — like the crack pipe, like the vagina, like your dog — Pookie.”</p>\n<p>Thus begins the show Friday night, Jan. 22 at Velvet Jones. As bizarre as this stage performance is to give in front of your mother, in person, it was relatively ingratiating. It also characterized the show perfectly. The main act Metalachi, a mariachi-metal fusion band (the world’s first and only) lives and breathes inappropriate comedy. Pookie’s frontman fits right in. The band’s music blares from the speakers.

I’m more blues, classic rock; the bass player and drummer they like metal and reggae, and the singer likes a lot of pop music.”</p>\n<p>Rather than hurting the band, the potpourri of influences helps it create a unique style. Forrest himself is good. During the act, several people tell me how much they like the guitar. His deft navigation of musical styles stands out.</p>\n<p>Finally, Metalachi takes the stage. Metalachi personifies showmanship. Their act is at least as much about the costumes, humor and performance as it is the music. Which isn’t to say the music isn’t good — it is. But singer Vega de la Rockha and trumpeter El Cucuy’s seemingly improvised comedic dialogues comprise the foundation of the performance. De la Rockha opens the act with a shoutout to our own prestigious institution. “Santa Barbara — the college — they’re known for their parties here,” and then after a moment: “They’re also known for their high levels of STDs!”</p>\n<p>And that pretty much sums up Metalachi.</p>\n<p>If you shy away from politically incorrect comedy, Metalachi is not for you. From musing about how “Caitlyn Genders” changed her car out for a garage, to warning patrons not to light a match because of the pervasive mac ’n’ cheese farts in the club (referring to Velvet Jones’s iconic nighttime snack), to lauding “Star Wars” for “incorporating Mexicans into the story” (Oscar Isaac is actually Guatemalan and Cuban), Metalachi exudes irreverence. At one point, El Cucuy refers to Donald Trump and begins a “Fuck that puto!” chant. Velvet Jones’s patrons happily participate.</p>\n<p>Metalachi’s music meshes the classical instrumentation of mariachi music with the catchy melodies of famous rock hits. While metal certainly influences their work, it’s metal in the broadest sense of the word. The band plays hits like “Sweet Child O’ Mine” (“dedicated to all the vatos still paying child-support”) and “I Wanna Rock N Roll All Night.” And it works. The trumpet, violin, guitarrón and guitar end up being the perfect instruments for rock ’n’ roll. Guest violinist “Queen Queef” (as she’s introduced by the other members of the band) stands out for her visceral style with the bow. The band clearly knows each other’s rhythms, too. They have a lot of chemistry, reacting immediately to the conclusions of De la Rockha’s and El Cucuy’s extended joke rifts.</p>\n<p>The band seems at its best pivoting off of these comedic interludes. The members leap into action. Guitarrón player Nacho Picante looks especially energetic, bouncing up and down with his instrument.</p>\n<p>Metalachi at Velvet Jones brought more than a mix of musical styles to the stage. They brought a show. From El Cucuy’s shout out to cougars to guitarist Paco Halen’s pelvic gyrations, this band makes sure what they have isn’t just a musical act, but a <em>performance</em>. At the end the group pays tribute. De la Rockha extols recently deceased Motörhead singer Lemmy Kilmister.</p>\n<p>“This song is dedicated to him, he’s probably checking us out from … I don’t know, hell.”</p>\n<p>The crowd loves it. Metalachi knows hell can be sexy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-2GikwGEfA</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mariachi-metal-group-metalachi-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mariachi-metal-group-metalachi-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mariachi-metal-group-metalachi-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mariachi-metal-group-metalachi-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mariachi-metal-group-metalachi-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6822,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6821,6820,6819],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tradition and Culture Converge with Itzhak Perlman and Emanuel Ax","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-1-261.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-1-261.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hundreds of octogenarians shuffle into their seats.

The house is packed. They have come to hear two of the most celebrated classical musicians in the world.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, Jan. 21st, the famous Grammy-winning performers Itzhak Perlman and Emanuel Ax arrived at the Granada Theater in downtown Santa Barbara. The pair came to the State Street institution as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series. Perlman, a famous violinist, feels like a relic of a more civilized era. The musician often plays for state dignitaries; the closest he’s come to “pop culture” is his work on the acclaimed theme for “Schindler’s List.” Ax, a famous pianist and longtime partner of Yo-Yo Ma (who will be coming to the Granada through Arts &amp; Lectures this March) carries a similar pedigree with him onstage.</p>\n<p>After they were announced, the performers entered the stage. Ax walks, Perlman zooms. Perlman suffers from Polio, a disease he contracted as a young child. He whizzes onstage on the type of scooter one would see on a late night infomercial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Mozart’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 17 in C Major begins, without a word from the musicians. Ax appears physically restrained, though he is partially obscured by the seated Perlman. Perlman erupts into the furious focus of a violinist sawing at maximum velocity. The two are old friends and play off of each other expertly. One patron, Anita Baldwin, spoke with the <em>Nexus</em>. “They must know each other very well. They’re, like, breathing the same breath.”</p>\n<p>The sonata’s pacing varies; the second movement creates a gentler melody and the third ramps up the speed, becoming almost frenetic by the end. The crux of the performance is the musicians’ dependence on one another. The hosts inform the audience in the beginning that while most piano-violin sonatas could be played without the violin and not lose much, Mozart’s No. 17 in C Major relies heavily on the presence of both instruments.</p>\n<p>After Mozart the pair moves into Fauré’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1 in A Major. The first movement begins with a more mournful tone, and throughout the song Ax’s piano often slows to a deliberate rhythm. The third movement diverges into a more whimsical tone. After Fauré comes an intermission.</p>\n<p>Another attendee, Walter Own, gave a word to the <em>Nexus</em>. “It’s amazing, the tradition and the culture that goes into this … presence,” he said. “They played that 200 years ago. They’re still playing it — there’s a reason, [because] they don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>The lights dim, signaling the end of the intermission. The last sonata the duo played is Strauss’s Sonata for Violin and Piano in E-flat Major. One particularly striking part of this performance was the way Perlman’s fingers snaked back-and-forth so rapidly across the neck of his violin. The rapid patterns of digit movement are a part of any string instrument performance. Seeing an instrumentalist without an orchestra or a rock band, however, really emphasizes how much energy and finesse goes into just those two hands, one sawing furiously and the other manipulating the strings.</p>\n<p>As the final scheduled songs conclude the audience leaps to their feet. Not that Ax and Perlman weren’t deserving, but the standing ovation feels routine at this point. I have never been to a performance of classical music where one wasn’t given. It almost feels as if rather than being moved by a performance, audiences dole out their standing ovations to beg for more music. If so, that’s alright, because it works. Ax strolled back out, followed by Perlman’s motorized transport. The two affably bantered about the different pieces they prefer to play. Perlman’s voice resounded with a booming, deep bass. His voice made his older, shrunken figure incredibly formidable, despite the fact that with his loose black clothing his closest visual analog is Noam Chomsky wearing a trash bag.</p>\n<p>David Fickes, a UCSB student and an anomalous under-40 patron, spoke to us about his experiences with Perlman and his music. As a teenager David played with a youth orchestra which hosted Perlman as a guest conductor.</p>\n<p>“They invited some local Vermont teens … I remember sitting about eight feet from this conductor,” he said. “It was the first time I heard music that brought me to tears.”</p>\n<p>The older patrons of the Granada seemed particularly happy to see younger audience members. I wondered if David got the same comments I did about how great it was to see people my age there. Many of the older attendees spoke about the necessity of maintaining culture and beautiful music. Some spoke about how art gets lost and these traditions have to continue. As far as new generations continuing the traditions of classical music, David described his experience as a teenager learning with Perlman for just a day or two.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the reasons I’m at UCSB as a performance major.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67739\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67739\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/","id":6825,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6824,6823,6822],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"XYLØ and FMLYBND Take Over Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-355x230.","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-980x647.","description":"It took me by surprise when I read about XYLØ’s upcoming show dates and I did not see one for Los Angeles, but dates for both San Francisco and Santa Barbara.

XYLØ is a duo based out of L.A., but their fan base has already spread across the world in a very short amount of time. I had the opportunity to speak with David (last name declined), a local longtime hard rock aficionado, before the show began, and he emphasized that “… it took me a while to get into other forms of music … XYLØ is just someone you cannot help but let draw you in.” He was indeed correct with this statement, because XYLØ (along with FMLYBND, Blues and Greys and another local opening act) drew in a full house at Velvet Jones on a frosty Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Velvet Jones as a venue is pretty small and intimate, but this often is an advantage for artists because it makes it easier to interact with the crowd. It also gives the fans an opportunity to engage with their favorite bands or artists. However, if you are under the age of 21, you will on occasion be required to watch the show from the upstairs balcony. This being my first time at the venue, it felt slightly like the “walk of shame,” and it also made it difficult to interact with other fans and possibly network with the performers. Besides this minor problem, Velvet Jones is a decent-sized venue with quality sound, and some of the best macaroni and cheese you have ever tasted.</p>\n<p>The Blues and Greys were an opener for the night, and in contrast to their music style, they played a fairly mellow set. The crowd was in tune with their performance, but oddly, I found them almost easy to ignore. Their lead vocalist has a lot of potential, but I felt the performance would have been a lot better if she would have focused on her vocals rather than her stage presence. I found her movements distracting, and awkward at times, but when I really zeroed in on their sound, I actually enjoyed it. The Blues and Greys possess a sound similar to the earlier days of Paramore, but they nailed the task of taking that sound and making it their own.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Up next would be XYLØ, and from the moment they took the stage, I felt like I was back in a Los Angeles venue myself. Lead vocalist Paige Duddy has a way of taking your gaze and running with it from the second she begins performing to the time she leaves the stage. XYLØ is comprised of brother and sister Paige and Chase Duddy, along with Leonard Newell and Nick Truhan, with a chemistry that makes it an absolute masterpiece. I firmly believe that if anyone different were placed in any of their positions, the band would not possess the soaring energy it does. If one were to attempt to label their stage presence, it would only undermine what it actually is. Every bit of magic poured all throughout the venue, and I could not help but praise as if I were in a church on a delightful Sunday morning. XYLØ will not be playing on small stages for long, so I would advise seeing them while one still has the luxury of watching them at a small, yet intimate venue.</p>\n<p>FMLYBND took the stage last, and as they are Santa Barbara locals, the crowd was all too excited to see them perform. After touring with names like Milky Chance, playing huge festivals and even having a song featured on FIFA 15, it is a homecoming gift to see them play again at such an intimate venue. They were alive, electrifying even, and their grunge take on electronic music is unlike anything I have ever heard before. In every song they performed, there was a clear representation of the use of multiple instruments. Personally, I like to think of FMLYBND as a mixture between MGMT and M83, but when you factor in the rosy vocals and the mystical instruments, there is no way to place them in between anything. Their performance was the revitalization I needed after a very long night.</p>\n<p>Overall, the show was one worth giving up a Saturday night for. Each band had something more to contribute to the previous set, and they did so in a timely fashion. Although it was a pain not being able to talk to any of the bands after, I would do it all again and I would not change a thing if I could hear all of these great bands play together again.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR74ZadqjNA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/","id":6821,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6820,6819,6818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Preview: Lemaitre Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img-lemaitre_121354411982-e1453948400792.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img-lemaitre_121354411982-e1453948400792.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"It may be true to say that electronic music has never been bigger than it is today.

Massive festivals like EDC, Tomorrowland and Electric Zoo dominate the festival-scape, and even more traditional events like Coachella are scrambling to fit electronic acts at the top of their lineups. Due to the dominance of big-name acts and the sea of people spewing music out onto SoundCloud from their laptops, it can often be hard for smaller EDM, dance or techno groups to make a name for themselves in the industry. However Norway-based duo Lemaitre have done just that and on the eve of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U-aDUXpre0\">next album drop</a>, Jan. 28 they will bring their funky electronic magic to the stage at Santa Barbara’s SOhO music club.</p>\n<p>Lemaitre is made up of high school mates Ketil Jansen and Ulrik Denizou Lund. Both in early 20s the two have been making music together since 2010. Their funkadelic, guitar-and-synth-driven style of electronica brings to mind 2000s techno greats like Daft Punk as well as deep and tropical house acts like Fingers Inc. and Kygo. Honestly, it’s music that makes you feel pretty good about yourself and the several inches of air or sweaty flesh around your head. It also demands that you bob in place from side to side like one of those <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bluw-B00G1063-Solar-Dancing-Cactus/dp/B001FRAGDI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8\">solar-powered dancing cactuses</a>. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqkzR0sdtuU\">this</a>. It’s impossible not to.</p>\n<p>While their incredible musicianship and production talents are both worthy of marvel, one of the most unique aspects of Lemaitre is their ability to deftly navigate the landscape of the music industry in the internet age. The duo release all of their music <em>for free </em>on their <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/serious-url\">SoundCloud</a>, and in doing so completely negate the issue of piracy hurting their ability to make a living. They’ve generated a massive fan base through a very active social media presence, especially on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lemaitremusic\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lemaitremusic\">Twitter</a>. This has led to their massive success in recent years, most notably in getting signed to Astralwerks Records, home of industry giants Porter Robinson and Deadmau5. Lemaitre first broke into the scene with a set of EPs called the <em>Relativity Series</em>. The second in the series, <em>Relativity 2</em>, topped the electronica charts in both the U.S. and Canada.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jansen and Lund have recently moved their base of operations to L.A.

However, upon reaching the destination, I noticed married, middle-aged couples hand-in-hand, aspiring young guitarists, a mix of men in jeans and leather jackets (probably reliving the days they played guitar in their parents’ garage) but also men in proper suits and ties. It then hit me the range of audience Emmanuel’s music spoke to. Of course, using the word “spoke” is for lack of better word, as most of his songs are instrumental. Was it going to bother me? Admittedly, a bit. But did it actually <em>really </em>after I left the show? Not at all.</p>\n<p>I rushed to my seat even though the show wasn’t starting for another 15 minutes. People near me chatted about the real talent Emmanuel is. Overall, the vibe was light and optimistic; it almost seemed as if everybody knew everybody (somewhat like a Christmas dinner party, if you ask me).</p>\n<p>As prompted, the show opened with a duo called wisherkeepers. “They have to be married,” was the first thought I had when they sung the first breath of their song — their chemistry was undeniable, after all — and they were. Nice, soothing folk melodies and ballads filled the room until about 8:50 p.m. The energy in the room was enticing and addicting as we all waited on the edge of our seats for Emmanuel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The legendary Australian solo guitarist brought more than just good music (and that itself is an understatement). He brought the heat, he brought enjoyment and he brought absolute genius pieces to grace us with. Right from the get go, men were screaming his name as he entered the stage. It surprised me how much Emmanuel got the elderly hyped.</p>\n<p>Watching Emmanuel perform was nearly otherworldly. The 60-year-old man was pulling smooth tricks on his guitar I didn’t even know could be done. His music generated a happy, “get up and dance” vibe amongst the crowd. However, he could also elicit a melancholic tone through his finger picking technique. All with no words! Although he did sing a few songs, it was the ones that didn’t need the lyrics that hit home the most. He could change the pace so quickly, sometimes you couldn’t even see where his hands were moving. It was all natural, good fun; the man clearly enjoyed showcasing his talent.</p>\n<p>It was moving to hear the inspiration behind the songs he performed. In “Angelina” (his most notable song) he used his daughter as his muse, and another one, “Endless Road,” was inspired by the ups and downs in life. Even the movie “Bridge of Spies” influenced the virtuoso for his song “Eva Waits.” His songwriting was the genuine originality of relying on in-the-moment experiences, where he’d encounter something in life, and use it to create these pieces.</p>\n<p>Seeing his finger picking style was a feat I anticipated above all, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Emmanuel’s talent with the guitar is extraordinary—he simultaneous plucked with the fingernails on one hand while fingers danced across the strings with the other. The most impressive guitar stunt he pulled that night was managing to play the drums. No, there wasn’t an actual drum set on stage. That’s right, he did it with his guitar. The place livened up tenfold at this point. Simple head nodding and feet tapping throughout the show turned to full-on head banging. And let’s just remember the elderly demographic here.</p>\n<p>Emmanuel was downright charming and cheerful on stage. Everyone loved him, maybe a bit <em>too</em> much — “Move here!” someone shouted to him, which was followed by laughs and giggles. What makes it even better is when you learn that his set list was entirely improvised.</p>\n<p>He finished off with an encore of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” — his own rendition, of course. It was sad to see him go — not just for me, but for everyone in the room.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to a lovely older couple, Waneen and John Marks, after the show, they were bursting with life, even in the chilly night weather. “I can’t believe what he can make the guitar do,” Waneen said, her husband nodded in agreement. Although they’re only recent fans of Emmanuel, that doesn’t discredit how much they support him. They flew in from Washington State just to see him perform! First-year UCSB student Madison Parker was only there for her music class, but ended up enjoying the show a lot more than expected. “I’ve never seen anything like it before,” she commented on his finger picking style.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a memorable show and definitely, without a doubt, worth a Friday night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67626\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/tommy-emmanuel-energizes-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67626\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/tommy-emmanuel-energizes-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/tommy-emmanuel-energizes-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/tommy-emmanuel-energizes-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/tommy-emmanuel-energizes-campbell-hall/","id":6819,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[6818,6817,6816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finding Home with Brooklyn","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn.jpg?resize=670%2C377&ssl=1","description":"Where is home? “Brooklyn” chronicles a young woman’s journey that is both literal and introspective.

After stepping out of Ellis Island’s customs checkpoint into a heavenly light, Saoirse Ronan’s Eilis Lacey must choose to commit herself to the possibilities of America or the familiarity of Ireland.</p>\n<p>The movie, set around 1952, exudes a sense of wonderment and melancholy, which I think is appropriate for a story about a young woman finding herself in a strange, new place. After Eilis’s sister Rose arranges for her to live in the colorful scene of Brooklyn, New York, she travels to America aboard a boat that seems hospitable until the waves start a-churnin’ and so does her dinner. Lacey arrives in Brooklyn as one of the many dozens of Irish folk trying to make their way in the world, whereupon she inhabits a boarding house populated by giggly yet helpful women and their amusingly terse housekeeper. Although New York is a lively escape from the quietude of shamrock country, Eilis finds herself tearful as she receives letters from home, reminding her of the life she left behind.</p>\n<p>After getting a job, she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), an aspiring Italian plumber with whom she begins a relationship. After tragic events, she returns home and finds herself enamored with another gentleman caller played by Domhnall Gleeson, now hot off the success of Star Wars. Both of these characters represent their respective environments through their personalities, indirectly drawing Eilis to both sides of the pond.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Fiorello has attitude, ambition and exudes the possibilities of the hardworking American. He embodies a new, exciting life, but comes off as a little pushy, so it’s believable when Eilis considers his towering alternative. In contrast, Gleeson’s Jim Farrell is the more familiar option. He’s mannered yet charming, but reflects the life that Eilis was trying to get away from in the first place. Neither of them are perfect, but they are each believably enticing enough to give credence to Eilis’s hesitation. It’s a plot that’s pulled off far better than it ought to have been. Perhaps I’m just glad that there was no love triangle. I don’t care for those; it’s why “The Hunger Games” eventually lost me. Team I Don’t Give a Shit.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Considering Brooklyn’s narrative, it’s important to be able to both sympathize with the main character and reflect her turmoil in her performance. Saoirse Ronan pulled it off. She goes through a wide array of emotions and sells them: homesickness, despair, love, hope, and confidence. The best performances are the ones during which you look at a screen and see a character, not an actor trying to be that character. This is, of course, one of them. Give the Academy a call if you don’t believe me. Unless, of course, you’re also disgruntled on account of all the white Oscar nominees. In which case, tell Ronan yourself when she comes for SBIFF.</p>\n<p>Her emotional performance goes hand in hand with the film’s visual storytelling. The camera lingers on Ronan’s face for a prolonged moment as her character’s eyes dart around, showing us her confusion. We see a drawer of unopened letters sent from across the sea. The dim, wide beaches of Ireland stand out from the bright and crowded ones of Coney Island. With a “less is more” mindset, director John Crowley subtly puts us in Eilis’s thought process through such imagery, making the film that much more emotionally involving as we come witness to a woman’s growth as she has to answer the question, “where is home?” and an even harder question, “Am I happy?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to say that nothing is more awesome than an Irish brogue. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67628\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67628\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/","id":5895,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5894,5893,5892],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brazilian Girls, Dreamers Set Upon SOho","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0059-e1453676232217.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0059-e1453676232217.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Setting: last Saturday, Jan. 16 a beautifully warm night delighted by a line-up subtly genius in nature draped itself over Santa Barbara.

Inside an interesting restaurant concert venue styled American, almost-Southern-European, bar and lounge, monochrome photographs depicting close ups of models in late 20th century fashion hang along the deep red brick walls. A bar stands stranded in the middle foreground of the dining area, separated from any walls. A brass framed mirror hangs on the lounge wall, reflecting warm, desert-sun casted, sand yellow lamps; thin cylinders pendant from the vaulted, wood-panel ceiling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating lightly zested, succulent, crunchy calamari while Dreamers warm up SOhO Restaurant and Music Club with some quick-paced, hard-thumping snare and bass, enveloped by roughened strumming. A tiramisu and raspberry jam covered cheesecake dessert shared with friends was delicious, while the DJ spun The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Miike Snow and MGMT’s “Kids” followed by Two Door Cinema Club, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Milky Chance; an array of recent chart favorites comfortingly raising the energy levels of visitors that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After enough DJing, Dreamers plug in and slam, shredding mercilessly upon their instruments. A dream-catcher hangs and trembles from lead-singer and guitarist, Nick Wold’s, mic stand. Three voices spill from the stage as drummer Jacob Lee Wick and bassist Nelson join Wold in vocal support. Along with the impeccable sound engineering at the club, the lyrical Dreamers kept SOhO moving.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging from the spray-painted streets of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the group has set out on their first tour. Now they are stationed in L.A. working on their album to be released in mid-to-late March. Surprisingly, this will be their first LP release, although an EP came out in November of 2014. The stage chemistry between the members along with the vibrations and melodies emitted from their instruments portrayed the band as congruous as old veterans.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their sound was not entirely unfamiliar, but stood out among others within their indie-rock genre. A mixture between Young the Giant and a more-garagey Two Door Cinema Club,Dreamers’ music kept the atmosphere buzzing and excited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their tracks “Shooting Shadows” and “No Love” cascaded throughout the dance pit, and “Wolves” shook the rafters, grey-painted metal pipes and the floor beneath the audience’s feet. The energy spewing from the audience stomping and jumping across the wooden floorboards harmonized fluently with the band’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightening up the crowd magnificently, Dreamers made way for Brazilian Girls! Immediately, the lights were dimmed and only the stage light set furthest upstage glowingly alighted the back of the stage in a light fade. This hardly provided enough light to envelop the drummer, Aaron Johnston, if anyone. guitarist Jesse Murphy, lead vocalist Sabina Sciubba and keyboardist Didi Gutman were left to prance around in the dark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the probable request for limited lighting by the band, they spun SOhO around and around until the audience was screaming for an encore at the end of the show. Their upbeat, dance-infused jazz and bossa nova peppered electronic reggae grew out of darkness, awing the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They opened with their new single, “Critics,” which elegantly introduced the public to the pleasant weirdness comprising a good portion of Brazilian Girls’ work. Later, favorites such as “Don’t Stop” and “I’m Still Sleeping” sprayed over the crowd. Thankfully not the last song in their repertoire that night, “Pussy” was performed toward the end of the show; it would have been the obvious choice, but not the only great one. Instead they closed with a “jammed” version of a past album track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd moved with the beat of the music. Sciubba’s alluringly mysterious stage presence crept throughout the space as the front rows shined bright white in smiles. She arrayed herself in a long, draping black sports coat over a deep blue tank top aflame in fire emblems of orange and yellow. Shiny royal blue tights in star emblems aligned her skinny legs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brazilian Girls effortlessly breathed vibrant life into downtown SB, enticing young and old to dance a night away in pure joy. As unique, strange or varied the troupe’s musical endeavors are, they maintained a danceable energy that locals of SB thoroughly inhaled, devoured, respected and enjoyed. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67590\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67590\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/","id":6818,"author":{"id":727,"name":"Alec Hartnett"},"related":[6817,6816,6815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ghastly, Local Acts Make Sunday Funday @ SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Swarms of drunken Isla Vistans descended upon SOhO Restaurant and Music Club Sunday night to jump up, down and all around to the show SELECT Entertainment and We the Beat lined up.

Individuals who normally show up 20 minutes late to their 11 a.m. classes actually arrived to the venue on time in order to support local artists Bucketz and DJ Prodijay. The venue was filling up long before Ghastly was set to go on stage.</p>\n<p>After some slight hassle and wait time to get into the venue, most of the crowd went directly to the bar. Bucketz was able to lure thirsty college students away from their tequila shots and over to the stage with some tasty house tunes. The dance floor was “lit af” and he was only half way done with his set. His support wasn’t only from locals either. I managed to talk to some folks from Santa Monica and Oxnard who told me they were glad they showed up in time to see the opener and couldn’t wait to find him on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>DJ Prodijay kept the hype building for Ghastly with his own blend of house. More and more people were entering the event and gravitating directly over to the stage, a tribute to Prodijay’s mixing. The demographics of the crowd made it feel like Isla Vista had literally taken over SOhO and decided to make it into the greatest house party.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Unfortunately, I spent most of Prodijay’s set waiting in the cursed bathroom line, making bathroom-line friends that I’ll probably never see again. By the time I got out and back on the dance floor, Prodijay was wrapping up his set and SOhO was the most packed I’ve ever seen it. When Ghastly finally came on in the late hours of the night, the crowd was well past drunk and very, very hyped for the headliner.</p>\n<p>Ghastly’s set had all the components of catering to a crowd that was as energetic as any Sunday night. He dropped some nasty beats and paired them with colorful visuals that combined to turn the house party into an all-out rager. Audience members were getting low and pushing around so much that I had to take a step back and watch from the safety of the sound booth corner. Frat dudes lost their shirts and girls ended up on shoulders for the ‘gram — a true sign of a performance well done.</p>\n<p>With the show done, audience members reluctantly left the venue in search of their Ubers and after parties to continue the great experience at SOhO. I managed to snag a spot on a random bus that had no intentions of turning down anytime soon. Seeing local artists build such a great atmosphere for an up-and-coming artist like Ghastly is something I hope to see more of in the future. Kudos to all those that contributed to making that Sunday one for the books, y’all crushed it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/","id":6817,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6816,6815,6814],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":33,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
