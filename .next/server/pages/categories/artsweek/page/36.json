Soft background music created a tranquil ambiance while people freshened up their drinks, engaged in small talk and swayed along to the beat. It was the calm before the storm.</p>\n<p>The attendees of this sold-out show trickled in from every walk of life. Literally. Checkered Vans-wearing undergrads, oxford-sporting graduate students, laid-back locals in flip flops, and frequent club-goers in stilettos all made their marks on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>As the clock approached 9:00, individual groups of minglers quickly morphed into an antsy crowd in anticipation of the opening act. Thanks to SOhO’s intimate setting, dodging elbows to the face in hopes of securing artist visibility was a non-issue, unlike in most general admission venues. Any spot at SOhO is a good spot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So, 9:15 passed. Ok, no big deal. Artists run late all the time.</p>\n<p>Then 9:30 passed.</p>\n<p>By 9:45, the storm began to brew.</p>\n<p>The previously nonthreatening crowd became rambunctious. Drinks were spilled. Chatter was thunderous, and mile-high platform heels turned their owners into mere puddles on the floor.</p>\n<p>Finally, an hour later, Leikeli47 appeared sporting her signature mask and an unapologetic New York attitude. The instant she made her entrance, a surge of bone rattling bass vibrated the room so hard that it is a wonder SOhO still has a second floor. At this point in the night, the crowd was ready to respond to any stimulus, so when Leikeli47 demanded that everybody “clap [their] fucking hands,” you can bet everyone responded obediently regardless of how they felt about the performance. For example, even the middle-aged woman who so eloquently voiced her opinion by shouting, “This shit sucks!” could not resist bouncing along to the bass’s heavy beats.</p>\n<p>Leikeli47’s abrasive raps lacked substance overall, but her exceptionally repetitive and simplistic lyrics had the crowd chanting along to the previously unfamiliar songs. Therefore, although the New Yorker’s vibe was out of place in laid-back Santa Barbara, she did manage to temporarily satiate the small but mighty crowd’s unruly energy.</p>\n<p>Within minutes of the opening act’s departure, a petite girl, who was barely visible under the shadow of a wide brimmed black hat, took her place on the stage. With no introduction necessary, Jennifer Lee (alias TOKiMONSTA) kicked off the third show of her nationwide Fovere tour with a charged-up rendition of Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick Push,” to which the crowd went wild.</p>\n<p>Lee’s hypnotic visuals and pulsing, euphoric beats turned charming SOhO into an elated dance club complete with attendees busting out interpretive, jellyfish-like moves which mimicked Lee’s melodic whimsy. Who else creates a mix of “The Next Episode” and “Hypnotize,” then jumps a decade and transitions to Tinashe’s “2 On,” cuts to “Bitch Better Have My Money” and ends the rollercoaster montage with some Kendrick Lamar?</p>\n<p>While original remixes seemed to be the crowd favorites, die-hard fans like Jessica, a fourth-year UCSB sociology major, were most excited to hear tracks from TOKi’s older albums. However, judging by the lack of familiarity that many attendees had with TOKiMONSTA’s original songs like “Realla” and “Go With It,” one could assume that the majority of this crowd came curious to discover new music. They were not disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lee enjoyed her time on stage almost as much as her audience enjoyed her performance. In the middle of her set, TOKi smirked and addressed the crowd for the first time to say, “I hope you guys like this Spanish version of ‘Hotline Bling,’ because I personally think it’s better than the original.” She later toyed with the audience by pretending her set was over. After a chorus of encores, Lee ran back out and said, “Ok maybe one more.” That one more song turned into two more and then three more until she ended with a bass pounding remix of “Shabba” and “Bugatti” that tore the roof off of SOhO.</p>\n<p>Lee’s inherent charm and knack for mixing things, as she puts it, “that are really chill and really angry and obscure” turned everyone into a fan of the “bunny monster” by the end of the night. Plus, she gets extra points for playing some Spanish Drake.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a very well spent Thursday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarush Mohanti / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>On Dec. 1, 2014, comedian Stephen Colbert dedicated his show’s opening segment to an impassioned recollection of a moment from his childhood: seeing “Star Wars: A New Hope” a whole two weeks before any of his friends did. Colbert, who won two tickets to an advanced screening from a radio station in eighth grade, recognized immediately that “Star Wars” had changed everything and lamented the fact that none of his classmates yet understood his love for that galaxy far, far away. Although Colbert has been a “Star Wars” fan a whole two weeks longer than most people, ask any person who was young during the summer of 1977, and I bet they will have a similar story to tell.</p>\n<p>The success of “Star Wars: A New Hope” was truly unexpected and unprecedented: the film was turned down by United Artists, Universal Pictures and Disney, but was finally budgeted a measly $8 million by 20th Century Fox. It opened on a Wednesday in less than 32 theaters nationwide, with even George Lucas forgetting the film’s premiere. The film was an immediate smash hit — theaters quickly began demanding the film, and Fox’s stock price doubled in three weeks. “Star Wars” quickly became the most successful film they had ever released. All this from a film that Lucas so expected to flop that he wrote a self-contained storyline in case he was denied future funding.</p>\n<p>In 2012, after five more “Star Wars” movies and a handful of ill-fated TV specials and animated features, Lucas sold Lucasfilm, along with the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” properties, to Disney for $4.05 billion. With George’s empire now in their hands, Disney quickly announced a new trilogy of films, with “The Force Awakens” taking place roughly 30 years after the events of “Return of the Jedi,” as well as three stand-alone films focused on specific characters. The Internet, of course, went wild.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With less than a month left until “The Force Awakens” premieres in North America Dec. 18, 2015, how much do we actually know about the film? Unsurprisingly, very little, with a lot of room for speculation. Between a handful of teasers, two trailers (one Japanese) and a 60-second spot, we can infer a lot about the film.</p>\n<p>Even 30 years after the death of Emperor Palpatine, the galaxy still finds itself in a struggle for peace, with the Empire replaced by the New Order, led by a new masked darksider, Kylo Ren, a member of the Knights of Ren, a cult devoted to “finishing what [Vader] started.” Fighting against this new reign of tyranny are scavenger Rey; Poe Dameron, a member of the Resistance, which has replaced the Rebel Alliance; and Finn, a First Order deserter who is somehow in possession of Anakin Skywalker’s lightsaber (y’know, the one that Obi-Wan picked up when he left Anakin for dead and then gave to Luke, who lost it when his hand got chopped off in Cloud City. Yeah, that one). Guiding these young heroes along are near-mythical figures Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker (whose face has yet to appear in promotional content).</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to imagine a storyline for this film. Considered together, the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy tell the tale of the fall of a father and his eventual redemption through the help of his son and the triumph of good over tyrannical evil. From the second that he accepts Anakin’s lightsaber from Obi-Wan in “A New Hope,” Luke assumes the responsibility of being his father’s son, and all the good and evil that comes with it. The Rebel Alliance’s toppling of a monolithic, totalitarian and xenophobic imperialist regime was just a secondary benefit of Luke’s quest. And just as Obi-Wan passed the lightsaber on to Luke, just as George Lucas passed the lightsaber on to J.J. Abrams, just as the generation that saw “A New Hope” in theaters passed the lightsaber on to their children, the characters of the original trilogy pass their triumphs and struggles on to a younger generation — a new group of protagonists who are strong as the aging heroes grow weary.</p>\n<p>And that’s what this is all about, isn’t it? The passing of the lightsaber — the changing of the guard. “The Force Awakens” boasts an amazingly long cast of series veterans, many of whom are returning to these characters after more than 30 years away: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Leia Organa), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Warwick Davis (Wicket the Ewok) and Tim Rose (Admiral Ackbar). The project also employs veterans Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the scripts for “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” composer John Williams and sound designer Ben Burtt.</p>\n<p>And so it was with this “Star Wars” “brain trust” that J.J. Abrams embarked on his labor of love. With the help of Simon Pegg, whom Abrams treated as a sounding board, a generation that had grown up absolutely enamored by “Star Wars” was given the chance to play in the galaxy far, far away while working with many of the people who made the place what it is today. Many of Abrams’s choices hearken back to the original trilogy: heavy reliance on practical effects, scale models and actual set pieces in contrast to the prequel trilogy’s extensive reliance on CGI; the use of 35mm Kodak film and 65mm IMAX in contrast to the digital cameras used for “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith;” and the return of iconic ships such as T.I.E. Fighters, X-Wings, Star Destroyers, a massive spherical superweapon and, most importantly, the Millennium Falcon.</p>\n<p>“The Force Awakens” is a second coming of “Star Wars” in a world that was let down by the prequel trilogy. It is made to recapture the childhood that a generation experienced in the summer of 1977. There is absolutely no way that it will not succeed in terms of sales; the real challenge is changing the game and inspiring a new generation, like “A New Hope” did all those years ago. According to Disney, the film’s second teaser trailer, released April 16, 2015, was viewed more than 88 million times within its first 24 hours online. IMAX ticket sales quickly reached over $6.5 million for just the U.S./Canada market, shattering records set by films like “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Avengers,” which had garnered around $1 million each. Ticket sales site Fandango crashed repeatedly while “The Force Awakens” sold more than eight times the number of tickets of the previous record-holder, “The Hunger Games.” Analyst Phil Contrino has predicted that “Star Wars” will easily earn $1 billion and could cross into the next billion. (For reference, “Jurassic World” grossed $1.669 billion worldwide and current record-holder “Avatar” grossed $2.788 billion.) Not bad for a group of scruffy-looking nerf herders.</p>\n<p>Here are my thoughts to those who of you who are planning on seeing it — and let’s face it, even if you don’t think you’ll see it, you probably will, and if for some reason you are adamant about not seeing it, it’s probably going to be all you hear about until February — re-watch all six films. That’s right, six. Take in the entire story of the Skywalker family, both the good and the bad, because we may soon be moving on to a new lineage of heroes. Plan on staying off the Internet and social media starting Dec. 14. And if by some weird, freaky, miraculous circumstance you have a friend that has not seen a “Star Wars” film, do not by any means let them watch any before they see “The Force Awakens.” Drag your friend through their protestations — through their kicking and screaming — to see “The Force Awakens” with you. If it somehow ends up being bad, then your friend might be angry at you for a bit. But if it turns out to be anything close to what “A New Hope” was, then your friend will forever remember you as the person who showed them an amazing film that changed their life. You will have passed on the lightsaber and shown them what it’s like to live a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away …</p>\n<p>And the Force will be with you.

The film consists of reenactments of real-life stories of LGBTQ+ members residing in Kenya.</p>\n<p>The film lasts about an hour and contains five vignettes, titled “Ask Me Nicely,” “Run,” “Athman,” “Duet” and “Each Night I Dream.” The film is straightforward in its plot and execution: the stories are short and to the point, and the film itself is entirely in black and white. The stories range from the ups and downs of a relationship between two high school girls to a researcher hiring a male escort to visit him in his hotel room. Although the stories vary in the status of relationships and the severity of conflicts within them, all five reenactments involve a sense of urgency in keeping the extent of their sexuality private.</p>\n<p>Many queer Kenyans who express their sexuality face discrimination from strangers, peers and their own families. According to a 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, 96 percent of Kenyans believe that homosexuality should not be condoned by society. Very traditional religious and cultural values held by the majority of residents play a large part in sustaining the country’s deprecating views of the LGBTQ+ community. Men and women can face up to 14 years in prison for engaging in homosexual acts, possibly even 21 years if the encounter is considered to be under “aggravated circumstances.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Laws against discrimination or violent acts don’t protect queer Kenyans. If they are attacked in a hate crime, they’re unable to go to the police to report it without being charged with homosexuality. Many officials even encourage citizens to make arrests themselves if an officer isn’t present. Many are fired from their jobs or kicked out of their homes for being queer. The real-life stories portrayed in “Stories of Our Lives” show how pervasive these detrimental opinions are in Kenya and the immediate effects they have on queer citizens.</p>\n<p>In the first short, “Ask Me Nicely,” a student named Kate is suspended from school for having a relationship with another female student. “Run” involves a violent confrontation between business partners after one sees the other, named Patrick, walking into a gay bar. The final short, “Each Night I Dream,” follows Liz and her partner Achi as they wonder how they’ll respond when the police come to interrogate them about their relationship.</p>\n<p>Stories like these are common among the LGBTQ+ community in Kenya. The film was made by The Nest Collective in 2014 to bring awareness to just how prevalent these circumstances are. The Nest is a collective based in Nairobi that works to create discussion on important societal topics through the arts, including film, music, fashion and other visual arts. The collective gathered the interviews for the film by traveling across Kenya, recording only audio to protect the individual’s identities. The group’s $15,000 budget came entirely from a donation from Uhai/EASHRI, a sexual rights fund also in Nairobi. Reenacting the stories took 8 months of filming with just one DSLR video camera.</p>\n<p>The film is banned for distribution and screening in Kenya for “promoting homosexuality.” Most of the film’s crew has remained anonymous, but director Jim Chuchu, executive producer George Gachara and writer Njoki Ngumi released their names in an interview with <em>Xtra!, </em>an LGBTQ+ magazine based in Toronto. Shortly after they went public, Gachara was arrested for violating the country’s Films and Stage Plays Act.</p>\n<p>While it may seem to some that the world has become much more accepting of differences, it’s apparent that we are nowhere near complete tolerance. Stories like Kate’s, Patrick’s and Liz and Achi’s occur far too often. Films like “Stories of Our Lives” bring a much-needed awareness to a wide audience about how far we still have to go to achieve true equality.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/","id":5890,"author":{"id":733,"name":"Karrah Bates"},"related":[5889,5888,5887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blitzen Trapper: a Socially Acceptable Country Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There I stood, a beacon of teenage streetwear among a sea of 20-somethings in flannels.

The crowd to see Blitzen Trapper on the night of Veterans Day at SOhO was not a varied bunch. The band took the stage at just after 9 p.m., drawing in the white folks from all corners of the venue. Eventually the crowd reached a decent size, especially considering it was a Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper wasted little time on the formalities of crowd interaction. When asked by lead singer Eric Earley how they were doing, the crowd responded with a surprisingly enthusiastic “Wooo!” Earley and I were both taken aback. “Not bad for a Wednesday night,” he mused, appreciative of the energy of the relatively small audience.</p>\n<p>The five-piece jumped straight into the tunes and sounded undeniably tight. Earley’s voice neither cracked nor faltered, carrying over an audience which hung on his every lyric. Drummer Brian Adrian Koch perfectly propelled the band forward, a metronome who knew how to have fun. The group has been together for well over a decade, and it was obvious in their performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Every band member clearly loved playing together on stage, and everyone in the audience loved being there to experience it. Guys nodded their heads and rocked to and fro. Girls swayed around, doing the appropriate corny dance, reminiscent of a Peanuts character. There were some die-hard fans who knew every lyric and sang along with Earley, and others who attempted to sit still and objectively analyze the musicianship, no doubt there for some sort of writing assignment.</p>\n<p>They played 25 or 30 minutes straight, their set mainly consisting of similar-sounding songs. One of their high points was not even one of their songs. They covered “Come Together” by the Beatles, instilling it with a hard American groove that the boys from across the pond never could. That number was impossibly danceable, and even the least country of us there couldn’t resist getting down with it.</p>\n<p>This first set of songs ranged from sounding like Neil Young to Lynyrd Skynyrd, eventually ending with another hard rock song, one of their own called “Fletcher.” It was at this point I realized I was enjoying myself, because I was disappointed to see them leave the stage so soon.</p>\n<p>The band wasn’t actually done — maybe just testing audience reception or regrouping backstage. Before long three of the five guys walked back on stage. The drummer, lead singer and keyboardist took control of the stage, but the tone was suddenly different. Koch the drummer took to a microphone, and the keyboardist opted for a natural piano sound. The trio played through a few ballads, lush with harmony and soothing instrumentation.</p>\n<p>Soon the bassist and rhythm guitarist were ready to rejoin the stage, and the reunited Blitzen Trapper played two finale songs. First they played their biggest hit to date, a song called “Furr” from their 2007 album of the same name. Immediately the crowd roared, then sang along with every word, creating a chorus much larger than seemed possible.</p>\n<p>Finally the band closed with another groovy tune, one called “All Across This Land,” from their newest album also of the same name. This song is ripe with syncopation and distorted guitar riffs. The crowd’s energy peaked as the whole place rocked and rolled with the band. Couples danced, Blitzen Trapper jammed out and smiled, dudes threw up Metal Horns half ironically, girls did that dance where they look at each other and flip their hair around. It was a grand ol’ time that unfortunately came to an end.</p>\n<p>It was only after seeing them live that one really gets to realize where Blitzen Trapper sits in the makeup of the music scene. If you ask a Blitzen Trapper fan to classify their music, the fan says “rock” or “folk.” However, if you played Blitzen Trapper for someone who hadn’t heard it before, most wouldn’t hesitate to call it country. The conclusion is this: Blitzen Trapper provides those who refuse to like country music with a taste of what they’re missing out on.</p>\n<p>Trying to classify Blitzen Trapper is difficult and ultimately futile. They put on an energetic, lively show that was more enjoyable than one would expect. While they can’t be pigeonholed into the labels “country” or “folk” or “rock,” Blitzen Trapper put on a damn good show that ended up being a lot of fun.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Following the overnight sensation of “Azeem’s Senior Flute Recital,” Ward secured a spot on “Jimmy Kimmel.” Shortly after, Ward teamed up with fellow student Timmy Linetzky (DJ Underbelly) for a UK tour spanning across much of England and Scotland. The duo is stateside once again, and they’ll be bringing their special brand of flute and bass to SOhO this Thursday.</p>\n<p>Before donning his Underbelly alter-ego, Linetzky was a classically-trained pianist; however, his current musical production style tends to lean to R&amp;B and hip hop. Last year, disillusioned by the stuffy nature of classical music culture, Ward had a similar divergence from his classical roots. As such, the UCSB alumnus began exploring jazz, R&amp;B and the largely uncharted territory of beat box flute. These wonder twins joined forces following solo performances at an open mic event in Isla Vista. They were at least in part drawn together by Azeem’s flute rendition of the infamous techno anthem, Darude’s “Sandstorm.”</p>\n<p>Not sure what a flute backed by a DJ set up sounds like? Well, neither did any of the concert attendees following this duo on their UK tour. While abroad, they performed for some crowds nearing close to 5,000 concertgoers, and they’re just now recording their first EP. Most of their pieces are jazz-hop reimagined covers of everything from “Habanera” to Ciara’s “Body Party.” Despite the high variation in genre of selected songs, each reinvention remains consistent in its construction: a strong, kick-drum-driven backbeat that dissipates to make way for high register flute melodies. These Gauchos will be delivering their first public performance in the Santa Barbara area this Thursday at SOhO.

They have been carefully crafting new music with their new live band for their “So … You DTF?” tour. Featuring rising artists Hippie Sabotage and Shooka, this mini-festival will be one for the books.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Nashville, Jordan Kelley and Jason Huber are the geniuses behind the rising electro-indie pioneer Cherub. The two met in college at Middle Tennessee State University, where they studied music promotion. They began making music together in 2010 using the leading sound production software. <em>Man of the Hour, </em>released in 2011, was the starting point of their viral career. Relying heavily on live performances, including appearances at Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, and music sharing between friends, the two built a loyal fan base.</p>\n<p>Their synth pop, neo-disco fusion was packed into another full-length album just five months after their debut, titled <em>MoM &amp; DaD</em>. The heavy use of layering Kelley’s half-spoken falsettos created the group’s most effective harmonies yet. They continued to evolve, holding on to their teen angst in two EPs released in 2013, <em>100 Bottles </em>and <em>Antipasto</em>. With tracks influenced by ‘80s alternative dance and sultry piano verses, their range of talent grew, as did their fan base.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cherub managed to retain the label “underground” until their most recent full-length album, <em>Year of the Caprese, </em>was released in May of 2014<em>.</em> The bouncy summer anthem “Doses and Mimosas” is their most successful single to date. Skimming the top of the charts, they finally got the recognition they deserved. <em>Year of the Caprese </em>delivers everything the duo is known for: party songs with light lyrical content that make you want to dance. Their electronic dance music contains more harmonies than bass drops, making for more radio-worthy tracks you can sing along to with the top down.</p>\n<p>Just four months later, in December of 2014, they released another EP, <em>Leftovers.</em> After a tour of the eastern half of the U.S., the two began creating their new live show for the “So … You DTF?” tour, in which they will finally make it back to California. With two additional musicians on stage (producer Nick Curtis on drums and Jordan Bartlett on guitar and keys), the band will be presenting some new music along with everyone’s old favorites.</p>\n<p>Sacramento-raised brothers and remix masters Hippie Sabotage will be joining Cherub in this night of dance-till-you-drop debauchery. The two started their career producing beats for their hometown rappers and soon expanded their variety and started working with a few noteworthy Chicago-based rappers. They debuted their own material with the EP <em>Vacants</em> in 2013, but their recognition factor skyrocketed when Ellie Goulding posted their remix of “Stay High” by Tove Lo on Instagram. With over 300 million views on YouTube, Hippie Sabotage quickly gained worldwide attention, and their tour with Cherub will cultivate their constantly growing fan base.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E45fogGN_Y8&amp;spfreload=10</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/hippie-sabotage-and-cherub-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/hippie-sabotage-and-cherub-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/hippie-sabotage-and-cherub-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/hippie-sabotage-and-cherub-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/hippie-sabotage-and-cherub-coming-to-soho/","id":6855,"author":{"id":731,"name":"Jordan Metz"},"related":[6854,6853,6852],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bay Area Hip Hop Legend Andre Nickatina To Return to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/andre-nickita.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/andre-nickita.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Bay Area hip hop fans are in for a treat Friday night, as Andre Nickatina makes an appearance at Velvet Jones in Santa Barbara.

Nickatina’s contributions to the mid-90s Bay Area hip hop renaissance vindicate his legacy as an underground pioneer. 20 years have passed since the “hyphy” storm first electrified Northern California. Understandably, Nickatina has seen more relevant days, but perhaps that is why you should be excited for this show. Attending will generate the closest thing to musical time travel.</p>\n<p>The list of Nickatina’s colleagues should be enough to pique your interest: E-40, Mac Dre and The Jacka. Nickatina never broke through on the same magnitude as some of his legendary friends, but the Bay still embraces him as an icon of equal importance.</p>\n<p>Nickatina first hit the scene in 1993 under the pseudonym “Dre Dog.” His 1995 album <em>I Hate You with a Passion</em> oozes west coast vibes. It puts a Bay Area spin on the G-Funk style that infested the Southern California 1990s hip-hop scene. Gritty, pounding beats and whiny West Coast synths produce an undeniably recognizable sound that will never be replicated.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nickatina’s sound further developed with his 2004 album, <em>Bullets, Blunts, N Ah Big Bank Role</em>. Similarities to E-40 can immediately be seen in just the titles of some tracks. For example, “Crackin Like Pistachio’s” and “2 T-Shirts N a Adidas Suit” evoke the impression that this is a rapper who can say just about anything and still make it sound cool.</p>\n<p>Most recently, in 2013 Nickatina released his self-titled album <em>Andre Nickatina. </em>His beats have been refined. They keep up with the times while successfully preserving the Bay Area sound that put him on the map.</p>\n<p>Nickatina’s unforgiving tone yields an old-school hip hop sound that is rare in today’s rap world. The performance will be something of a history exhibit. Have you ever wondered how bonkers a hip hop performance looked back when bona fide hustlers ran the game? This is your chance to get a pretty genuine taste.</p>\n<p>Nickatina shows aren’t easy to come by. Santa Barbara isn’t just a leg of a 50-city tour. He is playing six shows in various intimate California venues over the next five months.</p>\n<p>Velvet Jones is the perfect venue for Nickatina. If you’re a big fan, you’ll have an easy time getting up close and personal. If you’re thinking about going just to get your fix of Bay Area hip hop, the standing room balcony might be the viewing spot for you. The music will hit hard and Nickatina will surely make it a party, so buy yourself a $20 ticket and prepare to get hyphy in the function.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66493\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/bay-area-hip-hop-legend-andre-nickatina-to-return-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66493\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/bay-area-hip-hop-legend-andre-nickatina-to-return-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/bay-area-hip-hop-legend-andre-nickatina-to-return-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/bay-area-hip-hop-legend-andre-nickatina-to-return-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/bay-area-hip-hop-legend-andre-nickatina-to-return-to-velvet-jones/","id":6856,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6855,6854,6853],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Folk Legends John Hiatt and Lyle Lovett Come to Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/smosh-brothers.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/smosh-brothers.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Saturday night, Campbell Hall had a far different atmosphere than the average freshman lecture.

The backpacks had been replaced by designer purses. The full heads of hair and wispy no-shave-November efforts had been replaced by bald heads and mature white mustaches. The innumerable Hawaiian shirts remained (it’s still Santa Barbara), but some had the tasteful addition of bolo ties. This aged crowd filed in from across Southern California to see the singer-songwriter legends Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt.</p>\n<p>Hiatt was justified in referring to their tour as “our little Smothers Brothers comedy show.” Escorted by an entourage of guitars and microphones, the duo spent about as much time playing as they did bantering and killing the crowd with wholesome adult humor. The banter wasn’t exclusively verbal — during each solo it seemed as though the musicians were communicating to each other in a way that no one but Lovett and Hiatt could fully understand. This comfortable back-and-forth made it clear that the two were close friends both on and off the stage.</p>\n<p>Lovett, a four-Grammy-winning Texan, was soft-spoken and quick-witted. Every time Hiatt went off on a tangent and lost the crowd, Lovett interjected a quick one-liner and started a song. His lyrics were beautiful and diverse — some were drowned out with the laughter they elicited and others were magnified by the tearful silence that befell the crowd. During Lovett’s powerful final song, “If You Were to Wake Up,” even Hiatt missed the cue for his solo to wipe his eyes. With his endearing crooked smile and sharp wit, lady-killing Lovett met the audience’s high expectations.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hiatt, a Hoosier who grew up on IndyCar and Bob Dylan, had the larger personality of the two. Frequently bringing his singing down to a scratchy, throaty monologue or embarking on a Dylan-esque harmonica solo, Hiatt made his bravado known. It worked. The biggest applauses of the night were following these avant-garde displays, the peak of which was a two-part “bebop whistling” solo during Lovett’s “She’s No Lady.” His musical risk-taking was only a reflection of his own character — he supposedly stole a Thunderbird as a child and had brief stint in jail. Hiatt is his stage presence personified.</p>\n<p>To quote Lovett quoting Townes Van Zandt: “There’s only two kinds of music: the blues and zippity doo-dah.” The show had its fair share of both blues and zippity doo-dah, and plenty of songs that seemed to blur the line. Hiatt first wowed the crowd with the crowd favorite of the night, “Adios to California,” only to have the show immediately stolen back with Lovett’s “Give Back My Heart.” Hiatt’s other blues hits of the night were “Drive South” and his encore “Have a Little Faith in Me.” The best zippity doo-dah song of the night was Hiatt’s “Tennessee Plates,” an outlaw song that is only just beyond autobiographical for a man of his background.</p>\n<p>Lovett’s best blues were the aforementioned masterpiece “If You Were to Wake Up” and “L.A. County,” a song which he followed with his best quip of the night: “Sometimes you care about someone so much you realize they just can’t live without you.” Lovett also lightened the mood with “She’s No Lady” and “Church,” a song that genuinely encapsulated his southern roots.</p>\n<p>Some of the best performances of the night were the duets “White Boy Lost in the Blues” and “Thing Called Love.” The distinct styles of both men coupled harmoniously and their guitar battle was a saga of two masters of their craft, limited not by their skill but purely by their own creativity. Hiatt belted out a series of perfectly pitched hollers as Lovett fingerpicked a freaky fast folky fantasy, the combination of which left the crowd standing in full applause.</p>\n<p>On the second to last leg of their tour, the genial pair seemed to enjoy themselves more than anyone else in Campbell, with a few inside jokes thrown in just for their own enjoyment. After the show, Hiatt asked the crowd for donations to WorldVision, and there was even a bidding war for a Lovett-Hiatt signed guitar to support the cause. The proceeds would go to providing rural African villages with clean drinking water. Fully satisfied, the crowd was very generous, and the high spirits felt as the crowd marched out captured the atmosphere of the night.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbZn_Z5s-yA&amp;spfreload=10</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66479\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/folk-legends-john-hiatt-and-lyle-lovett-come-to-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66479\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/folk-legends-john-hiatt-and-lyle-lovett-come-to-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/folk-legends-john-hiatt-and-lyle-lovett-come-to-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/folk-legends-john-hiatt-and-lyle-lovett-come-to-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/folk-legends-john-hiatt-and-lyle-lovett-come-to-campbell-hall/","id":6852,"author":{"id":722,"name":"Thomas Mannell"},"related":[6851,6850,6849],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Firebrand Record Label To Bring Politics and Music Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fbsamplervol1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fbsamplervol1.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Ryan Harvey of the Riot Folk Collective and Tom Morello, the guitarist for Rage Against the Machine, are coming to SOhO on Nov. 16.

The duo aims to capitalize on the Che Guevara T-shirt-wearing, Occupy Wall Street spirit with their roster of up-and-coming underground musicians. Boasting a smattering of genres, from folk to hip hop to punk rock, and a variety of artists, from Harvey himself to Ramy Essam, the most famous musician to arise out of the rebel music scene of the Arab Spring, their label Firebrand Records launched in June.</p>\n<p>Ryan Harvey was kind enough to speak with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> and offer some insights into the realm of underground, politically motivated music. “So we’re just like watching the World Cup, and I was like, ‘Dude, let’s start a record label,’” Harvey said. Harvey reached out to his fellow folk activists and contacts in the world of radical left political music, and with Morello birthed a new label.</p>\n<p>Harvey himself will perform at SOhO on the 16th, along with three other musicians from the Firebrand label. “These are artists that not a lot of folks have heard of and have been doing stuff in the underground music world for a long time,” said Harvey.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Last Internationale alternates classic rock and punk influences with their energetic and often melodic rebel-rock sensibilities. Their sole album, <em>We Will Reign</em>, features a slew of radical, fist-pumping denunciations of all things corporate and militaristic. When a band writes a song called “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Indian Blood,” you know you’re in for hardcore protest music. They even have an album review from Bill Ayers, the 1960s “terrorist” who the Republicans tried to tie Obama to in 2008.</p>\n<p>Built for the Sea remains the least political of the four bands, but still uses their haunting melodic style to take on global warming with “Sinking Ship.” The band pairs indie rock vocals with ambient electronic sounds to craft a unique style.</p>\n<p>Bell’s Roar blends a unique mix of synth-pop, soul and electronic influences to create poetic compositions. Sean Desiree’s Bronx roots shine through, and her music becomes a medium with which to explore issues of her genderqueer identity.</p>\n<p>Ryan Harvey himself is all folk. Like an angrier, shriller Bob Dylan, he pursues corporate oppression with a vengeance and an acoustic guitar. Harvey often builds up frenzied and frenetic melodies vilifying American foreign policy and racist ideologies. No stranger to activism, Harvey touts the message of his anti-war organization, the Civilian-Soldier Alliance, along with a host of other topics. “I’ve got things about the refugee crisis and things about the Arab Spring protests and Black Lives Matter,” Harvey said.</p>\n<p>The Firebrand label aims to reintroduce many mainstays of the underground folk and activist music worlds. The upcoming show offers the opportunity to see these artists on their way to taking their radical messages and cutting-edge sounds to more mainstream audiences. “It’s a chance to hear hard-hitting music about relevant current events and issues, and given that we’re in such a political time period right now in the world and in the country, we’re trying to complement that in song,” Harvey said. The show promises to be both thought provoking and entertaining, and Harvey makes going or not going an ultimatum: “I don’t know when it will happen again in that area.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5_qUJG8tgQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/","id":6853,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6852,6851,6850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Therapy Becomes Art: “Marwencol” Kicks off The Humanities and the Brain Series","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marwencoldn111116.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marwencoldn111116.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nestled just around the corner of Beauville, France lies a town laden with rusty military tanks, chipped-paint buildings and dusty roads.

Men in camouflage garb bustle about, tending to wounded comrades and toasting to victories. Women dressed in bright pastels stage cat fights, ambush SS soldiers and operate time machines.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the World War II town of Marwencol is no ordinary community. In fact, it exists in two different spaces: in the physical realm as a backyard 1:6 scale model project and in Mark Hogancamp’s mind as a therapeutic endeavor.</p>\n<p>“Marwencol,” directed by Jeff Malmberg (making his documentary feature debut), follows Hogancamp as he creates his fictional town in an attempt to recover from a beating outside a Kingston, NY bar in April 2000. The attack left Hogancamp suspended in a nine-day coma. He awoke with lost memories and the inability to walk, eat, read or write. When his state-sponsored rehabilitation expired, he took matters into his own hands and began building Marwencol. Doll alter egos of his friends, family, attackers and himself populate the town, serving as bar tenders, soldiers, enemies and love interests in epic battles and re-enacted memories. Staging and photographing these dramas allowed Hogancamp to slowly recover his hand-eye coordination and provided an outlet for his frustration.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But little did he know Marwencol would soon break from his private bubble and storm the world stage. After its discovery by arts and culture magazine <em>Esopus </em>and an exhibition at a New York art gallery (and now an award-winning documentary), Hogancamp finds himself in conflict between the safety of his fantasy town and the real world he’s tried so hard to escape from.</p>\n<p>One of the victories this film achieves is in its mise-en-scene, thanks to Hogancamp’s sharp eye for detail. Briefcases clasped in the hands of 1:6 scale dolls carry guns with fake, removable magazines and certificates of ownership, handwritten in tiny yet legible cursive. Expert manipulation of hands and feet breathe realistic emotion in his dolls whether engaged in battle or romantic entanglements. Hogancamp even creates doll alter egos for his doll alter ego to play with, although he can only do so much (drawing eyeliner on a 1:36 scale figure rarely awards “on fleek” results).</p>\n<p>Rarely do the subject and filmmaker play so well together in a documentary, which is why Malmberg also deserves credit for his portrayal of Hogancamp. His success comes from keeping Hogancamp at the film’s focus: using Marwencol to frame the story of a man fashioning a fantasy to rebuild a reality.</p>\n<p>“Marwencol” is the first in the “Focus On: The Humanities and the Brain” series of screenings sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) and the Carsey-Wolf Center. After the film concluded, IHC director Susan Derwin sat down with Malmberg to discuss what Marwencol (and ultimately, art) can represent.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons Marwencol was powerful for [Hogancamp] was because it wasn’t just creating child’s play,” said Malmberg. “Or maybe that’s what child’s play is; it’s the creation of emotion.”</p>\n<p>As he filmed, Malmberg found himself examining the relationship between Hogancamp and himself. He recalls learning to ready the camera early to capture his friend’s uncontained excitement, intimate discussions of art and photography and a personal promise to present the character of Hogancamp as he is. In exploring this unique journey to rehabilitation, Malmberg raises important questions regarding the labels of “art” and “artist” for Hogancamp as a creator, Malmberg as a filmmaker and audience members as spectators.</p>\n<p>“We’re all trying to look inside this private world and he’s been kind enough to show us,” said Malmberg. “There’s responsibility there as an audience member and as a filmmaker to honor that experience.”</p>\n<p>Marwencol continues to grow today. Scenes constantly shift from playing major roles in the main narrative to being cast away as mere dream sequences. New buildings and vehicles (bomber planes, speedboats) boost the capabilities of Marwencol’s characters. Side stories take root, old ones replay, yet all have room for expansion. Call it child’s play, call it art, it’s evident Hogancamp always has something to (re)build.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66380\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66380\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/when-therapy-becomes-art-marwencol-kicks-off-the-humanities-and-the-brain-series/","id":6951,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6950,6949,6948],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Peanuts Returns, and It’s Wonderful","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peanuts.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peanuts.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I may have shot myself in the foot here by choosing to review a film mired in a universe I am only somewhat familiar with.

And I doubt very many people will want to go see a rated-G film in lieu of “Spectre,” which will probably go on to earn a billion dollars like its predecessor. However, if I were to choose between seeing James Bond inevitably kick some ass or see “The Peanuts Movie” again, I’d go for the latter option in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>That’s because “Peanuts,” written by the son and grandson of mastermind Charles Schulz, is flipping <em>adorable. </em>It’s hard not to fall in love with resurrected world of Charlie Brown and company. In addition to getting the tone of the world just right, “Peanuts” mixes nostalgia and new elements in fun ways. The art design is the same, but in CGI. It holds up 95% of the time, apart from a moment when two children talked and their mouths hardly moved. Purists need not panic, there are a few 2D sequences thrown in to spice things up. The classic “Linus and Lucy” comes back for a fitting encore, accompanied by “I’m Better When I’m Dancin’,” a fun little beat by Meghan Trainor. Snoopy even catches a break with his arch nemesis! Some will probably disapprove of these changes in formula. I have to admit, hearing the aforementioned songs side-by-side is a little jarring. It’s like listening to “Love Me Do” then “Radioactive.” If you can get over the feeling of anachrony then you’ll probably fall head over heels for this revival’s irresistible charm.</p>\n<p>“Peanuts” follows the honorable Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) in his quest to impress the Little Red-Haired Girl, who has just moved into town. As his attempts humorously blow up in his face again and again, Snoopy (voiced from beyond the grave by Bill Melendez via archive recordings) finds inspiration from his owner’s repeated failings. He writes a new, romantic tale of him fighting the Red Baron, providing welcome breaks in between the main story, as well as changing the scenery from “Peanuts” to something more along the lines of “Planes: Fire and Rescue” because there are planes, and forests … I need to watch more movies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While watching Snoopy and Woodstock fight the good fight against the forces of imagined evils is fun enough, all emotional investment rests with Chuck. I’m sure a lot of us can relate to the unease he feels with approaching and impressing his crush; we want to see him get the girl. But at the same time, when he is presented with choices that would hurt others as a result of that pursuit, we want to see him do the right thing as well and the film knows it. Scenes like Charlie giving up his slot at the talent show to help his little sister to be her bull for her rodeo routine hit home … grah! This film is too dang cute!</p>\n<p>Now, I think it’s worth noting that, adhering to “Peanuts” tradition, the entire cast (barring animals) is voiced by children. This is a rarity as usually in animation, adult voice actresses voice children, both male and female. Not so here, which really helps drive home the feeling that you’re watching “real” kids. A good thing too, considering much of the humor involves watching Charlie Brown’s classmates say and do things that seem both childlike and adult, from Lucy romantically pursuing the indignant Schroeder to Sally Brown capitalizing on her brother’s newfound fame by giving tours of their house to her interested friends.</p>\n<p>However, as the film went on I started to get the sense that the movie’s humor was not intended for modern day children, because a lot of the jokes were smart and considerably mature. While talkative tots I saw the movie with laughed at the fart gag in the trailer for the new “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” they were completely silent when Charlie Brown went on a snipe hunt for ‘Leo’s Toy Store’ by ‘Warren Piece.’ Add that with lines like, “What if I’m not ready for a serious relationship? I can’t afford a mortgage!” and “Your analysis of this literary classic is beyond reproach,” the children on-screen may as well have been speaking to their real-life counterparts in Latin. At least they cooed when Charlie blushed in the presence of the Little Red-Haired Girl, so I cannot say they were totally uninvested.</p>\n<p>As I conclude what I think actually may be my longest review yet, I want to say that “Peanuts” may not appeal to everyone. If you didn’t grow up with the Great Pumpkin or never had popcorn for Thanksgiving, chances are you’ll feel better watching “Spectre,” and that’s fine. But if you’re willing to indulge your nostalgia or let your inner child out for a day, go see “The Peanuts Movie.” Where else outside of a bad acid trip will you see a dog flying his house like a plane?</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is a big ol’ softie at heart.

Flores managed to garner a decent turnout for his evening of spoken word, hosted by the UCSB MultiCultural Center on Friday Nov. 5. The choice of Reds Bin 211 in downtown Santa Barbara’s “Funk Zone” for the venue turned out to be an apt one, since it was big enough to hold the crowd but small enough to be intimate, despite some issues with disruptive patrons.</p>\n<p>Flores walked on to Amy Winehouse’s “Stronger Than Me” and was bombastic and personable from the start. Throughout the evening he joked with both the DJ and audience members between poems and, even during more serious pieces, his energy never waned. As a San Francisco native, his passion for both his city and his half-Cuban, half-Mexican heritage motivated some of his best performances of the night. Eager to please, he apologised self-consciously for being too political or “a downer” whenever his poetry touched on raw subjects, yet it was in these moments that his performance was most powerful and garnered the biggest response from the audience.</p>\n<p>He opened effectively with “Spanglish,” a poem that alternated between rapid-fire Spanish and English to demonstrate the experience of having a transnational identity in what he described as a “multicultural but monolingual” U.S. While the poem was an excellent demonstration of his enduring connection to Chicano culture and his confidence as a spoken word artist, at points during this poem and the evening his delivery felt too studied and close to resembling a generic “Spoken Word voice”. However, these moments were brief and the potency and sincerity of the message behind his poems were more than enough to compensate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Spanglish” was followed by two more muted and personal poems. The first concerned Flores’ determination to avoid repeating his father’s mistakes in his relationship with his own son. The poem was a moving depiction both of Flores’ personal vulnerabilities and the toxic effect of hyper-masculinity on male relationships in general and was far superior to the love poem that followed. This second poem, based on an Aztec poetry form, occasionally edged into trite imagery and involved a minor overuse of repetition common to a few of his later poems.</p>\n<p>Noting that he loves spoken word because “it gives you the opportunity to say what you need to say,” Flores then changed the tone completely with his angry but humorous poem to Donald Trump. This revenge fantasy of sorts that imagined Trump meeting fugitive Mexican drug lord “El Chapo.” He continued to gain momentum after this point and followed with a poem that celebrated the historical alliance between “black and brown,” which presented historical fact with a passion that was infectious and expressed his disappointment at how this coalition is supressed in the name of financial interest.</p>\n<p>Flores saved his best poem, a rant against gentrification in San Francisco’s Mission called “Crowbar Thing,” until almost the end of the evening. Inspired by an incident in which a bar owner beat three Mexican men with a crowbar for hanging around his establishment, the poem moved from the humorous, lampooning the “googlefucks” looking for somewhere ethnic enough to be trendy, to the tragic with ease.</p>\n<p>The evening finished more light-heartedly with the recipe poem “Arroz Con Pollo,” a rapturous celebration of Mexican food and how it brings people together, as well as a poem toasting the excellence of San Francisco city, an uplifting counterpart to the bitterness of “Crowbar Thing.” This return to the joyfulness and exuberance of “Spanglish” seemed crucial to his message of the endurance of oppressed peoples through hardship and injustice and also served to end the evening on a more positive note.</p>\n<p>Overall, Flores’ performance demonstrated clearly why he deserved to be named San Francisco Weekly’s “Best Politically Active Hip-Hop Performance Artist.” While he is at his most effective as a performer when incensed, he is not content to merely point out social problems and his poetry was always as hopeful as it was angry.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/","id":6944,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[6943,6942,6941],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"7 Nicolas Cage Films That Everyone Needs to See","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-cage-e1447138512278.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-cage-e1447138512278.png?resize=800%2C630&ssl=1","description":"  Since the start of his career, Nicolas Cage has refused to be typecast.

He takes on countless roles that challenge him as an actor, and pushes his skills to the extreme. Over the years, many have considered this to be “over-acting.” What many don’t realize, however, is that Nicolas Cage may just happen to be the most talented actor in Hollywood. Below are some of the optimum films that showcase his versatility and pure gift as an actor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Vampire’s Kiss</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ah, one of his finest films. If the title didn’t give it away already, the answer is yes, in fact, Nic Cage does play a vampire. And yes, he has fangs. And yes, he is afraid of the sun. Quite possibly the best part of this film, however, is the fact that Nic Cage only <em>believes</em> that he is becoming a vampire after an encounter with a suspicious woman. It is all a delusion. Whilst coping with these delusions, Nic grows frustrated with his assistant, Alva. He gets so frustrated; in fact, that he feels compelled to angrily recite the alphabet. All the way from A to Z, Nicolas Cage shines in <em>Vampire’s Kiss.</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Face/Off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>John Travolta and Nic Cage switch faces. That’s right. Again, the title is not misleading in the slightest. Faces are removed, exchanged, and then all hell breaks loose. John Travolta plays an FBI agent who is attempting to prevent a terrorist attack, which is led by Nicolas Cage. When Travolta manages to knock Nic Cage out cold (trust me, it’s a long story), he realizes that the only natural conclusion to stop the attack is to switch faces. Obvious, right? The bloodless, seamless facial procedure feels all too similar to peeling the sticker off of a piece of fruit. Nic Cage eventually wakes up and realizes that he has a new face. And then, there’s the “all hell breaks loose” part. By taking on two roles in this film, Nicolas Cage truly justifies that he really can play any part.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> The Wicker Man</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’ve all heard it before: “NOT THE BEES!” This film is unique in comparison to Nicolas’s other works, because its eccentricity quickly made it a cult classic. Cage plays a sheriff in the film, who is sent to an island to investigate the case of a missing girl. What he finds, however, is a female-based Pagan cult. <em>Wicker Man</em> brings a lot of interesting elements to the table. For example, Nicolas Cage punches a woman in the face, inquires about a burnt wicker doll (“How’d it get burned?? HOW’D IT GET BURNED?”), and is tortured by pagans…with bees.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Stolen</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ever heard of the film <em>Taken</em>? Liam Neeson tries to find his daughter for a couple hours, only for her to be kidnapped two more times. Well, that’s what this is — but with Nicolas Cage. His daughter has been kidnapped, there are large sums of money involved, and there’s an abundantly emphasized deadline. Intermixed with the mysterious “We have your daughter” phone calls are a lot of frantic, hysterical Nicolas Cage moments. But of course, how could I forget the fight scene between Nic Cage and the kidnapper in which both parties end up catching fire? The scene is set to the 1969 Rolling Stones classic, “Gimme Shelter.”</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> National Treasure</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There aren’t a lot of people I would rather have lead me on a treasure hunt than Nicolas Cage. He has the perfect “Guys, I think I found something!” face. Who wouldn’t want to explore with that? The mere fact that his character’s name in the film is Benjamin Franklin Gates is terrific. In <em>National Treasure</em>, Nic Cage is curious, inquisitive, and kind enough to bring us along on his quest.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Moonstruck</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nic Cage as a central love interest is already intriguing, but as Cher’s central love interest? Perfect. In this film, he plays the alluring brother of Cher’s soon-to-be husband. And he nails an Italian (or possibly a Brooklyn) accent. Nic Cage is definitely desirable as a brooding baker in <em>Moonstruck</em>.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Valley Girl</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the movie that founded Nicolas Cage’s long, eclectic career. For that reason, a “thank you” is definitely necessary. It is responsible for his growth as an actor and his ability to perpetually improve his skill. This is also the film where Nic Cage showcased his ability to maintain a really convincing accent. He plays a rough guy from the city that meets a girl from the valley, but he finds that he can’t shake his rough ways. Amongst the superfluous amounts of valley-girl slang and bad boy allure is a young, blossoming Nicolas Cage.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/","id":5913,"author":{"id":386,"name":"Natalie Noblett"},"related":[5912,5911,5910],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blitzen Trapper To Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Blitzen-Trapper.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Blitzen-Trapper.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"The music of Portland-based group Blitzen Trapper is, just like all things from Portland, weird.

This quintet is nearing epic in both its age and discography, and has consistently straddled the lines between country, folk, and alternative rock. Their latest album, <em>All Across This Land</em>, was released on Oct. 2, and was self-described by the band as their “best one yet.” Blitzen Trapper’s national tour promoting the album will be making a stop at Santa Barbara’s own SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club on Nov. 11. The doors open at 7 p.m., and the band goes on at 8, wasting no time with an opener; tickets are $18.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper was formed in 2000, and initially used the moniker Garmonbozia. From inception until 2003, Garmonbozia was psychedelic, experimental, and exceedingly prolific. Garmonbozia was a six-piece which consisted of Erik Menteer, Brian Adrian Koch, Michael Van Pelt, Drew Laughery, Marty Marquis, and front man/songwriter Eric Earley. The band performed shows tirelessly all over the Portland area beginning in 2000. Garmonbozia went through a golden age in 2001, performing incessantly and independently recording four albums, which they sold at their concerts. Whereas most of modern Blitzen Trapper is a cross between alternative country and folk, these Garmonbozia records were closer to experimental in nature, and sounded psychedelic and unmistakably reminiscent of progressive rock.</p>\n<p>A few years and a few more albums later, the band changed its name to Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen Trapper is supposedly a reference to the lead singer’s middle school girlfriend, who had a Trapper Keeper binder with pictures of Santa’s reindeer on it, among them the one named Blitzen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since the name change the band has undergone many musical changes. Their very first album as Blitzen Trapper was eponymous, and while it was refreshingly experimental, it didn’t receive outstanding reviews or national recognition. It was not until their second album, <em>Field Rexx</em>, that Blitzen Trapper became commercially or critically successful. This album was a more straightforward rock record, and it drew comparisons to both Beck and Willie Nelson.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper and lead Eric Earley struggled to follow up <em>Field Rexx, </em>and over the course of the next four years they released no albums after deciding not to release two because they were not up to par with the standard they had set for themselves.</p>\n<p>The band didn’t hit its stride again until 2007, when they released <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em>. This album was a new high for the band. It received strictly rave reviews, even making some end of the year “Best-of” lists.</p>\n<p>Since 2007 Blitzen Trapper has existed in a golden age. At the end of 2007 they signed to the ultra-famous indie label Sub Pop. Since then they’ve released multiple albums, all earning fantastic reviews. They performed on <em>Late Night with Conan O’Brien, </em>made a music video with <em>The Office’s</em> Rainn Wilson, and continued to chart high on various Billboard rankings.</p>\n<p>With Blitzen Trapper’s latest album they attempt to make a return to straightforward, bare-bones bluegrass, drawing inspiration from their very first albums like <em>Field Rexx</em> which brought them to where they are today. Attending their SOhO show is a guaranteed treat, and promises to be a modern alternative hoedown.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7zyfArxibk</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/","id":6889,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6888,6887,6886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brainfeeder Artist TOKiMONSTA To Perform at SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tokimonsta.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tokimonsta.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Halloween may be over, but watch out because the TOKiMONSTA is coming to town.

On Nov. 12 at 8pm, world-renowned DJ and producer TOKiMONSTA (Jennifer Lee) is bringing her Fovere Tour to Santa Barbara’s own SOhO restaurant and music club. Named for her upcoming mini-album, The Fovere Tour kicks off on Nov. 9 making this show only the third stop in her nationwide tour. It’s also extremely affordable; a general admission ticket is only $18 (don’t act like you don’t spend almost that much on a burrito in IV).</p>\n<p>So, why should you go?</p>\n<p>Well, simply put, TOKiMONSTA is just plain cool.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Take her stage name , for example. She explains it as, “You have ‘toki,’ which is Korean for a rabbit—something sweet and innocent—combined with a ‘monster,’ and it explains the mentality behind my music. I have this yin and yang mentality where I like things that are really chill, and I like things that are really angry and obscure.”</p>\n<p>Lee discovered her passion for composing music in college. She attended UC Irvine to study business, but ended up making beats. Lee then participated in the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy in London in 2010, and by 2012, she was touring with the likes of Skrillex, Diplo, Pretty Lights and Grimes. Some notable performances include Coachella, Electric Zoo, Sonar Barcelona and Sasquatch.</p>\n<p>Lee’s unique take on EDM, hip hop, and everything in between led her to release two full albums, multiple EPs and vinyl-only singles through highly regarded labels including Ultra Records and Ninja Tune, and she has also become the first lady of Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder imprint.</p>\n<p>If you’re already familiar with TOKiMONSTA, then you understand why LA Weekly ranked her as LA’s best female DJ and noted her versatility as a producer. Her classical training and widely diverse music taste allow her to create melodies that take you on a journey. The boundless, textural soundscapes of her songs sweep you up, spin you around, and then unapologetically drop you in a newfound realm of music. While TOKi’s needle-pushing music stands on its own, her work with artists including Tinashe, Schoolboy Q, Miguel and Jesse Boykins III also showcase the demand for her productions and remixes.</p>\n<p>Since TOKiMONSTA refuses to box herself in to a single genre of music, her show will feature a little something for everyone through original tunes and new remixes. Lee aims for her sets to approximate “orchestrating live music,” which makes every performance exciting and unique.</p>\n<p>Lee fights against the current of repetitiveness that is prevalent in mainstream music today and marches to the beat of her own drum (or synthesizer) while continuing to please audiences on the dance floor time and time again.</p>\n<p>After all the pressure of midterms and life in general, there is no better way to release those stressful juices than through a night of dancing and musical therapy, so mark your calendars for Thursday, Nov. 12 and get your tickets to TOKiMONSTA. You won’t be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lee’s instinct for melodic whimsy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3kQHZmQmVI</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/","id":6932,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6931,6930,6929],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":36,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
