A few couches accommodate hushed conversations amongst those already there, and any newcomer’s pre-existing social anxiety dissolves into the dim lights and welcoming energy. Some people have never been here before, but the Biko House has a way of making them feel right at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranging from experimental folk to gothic electronica, an array of local and touring talent showcased their music at the Biko House in an event organized by Funzone on Oct. 17. This recurring DIY event operates under the mission of providing an accessible, diverse and substance-free music community to the Santa Barbara area. Bands such as Deanne Bunn, Diatom Deli, Serpent Season and Roper Rider entertained an intimate crowd of less than 30 attendees on what could have been another boring Wednesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time most of the people who come to these shows don’t know the bands who are playing, so it’s always exciting to see what’ll happen,” Serpent Season’s Randall Leong, a UCSB alumnus, said. “It should get pretty weird, probably.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leong, once a Biko House resident, returned to play at this event for the same reason he became involved years ago: the ability to share his music in an environment where creativity is celebrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of festivity, Serpent Season wore Halloween masks as they strummed electric guitars to their self-described sound of “dreary, ambient folk.” With a single set of string lights illuminating behind them in the dark room, it felt like a live rendition of the scoring to a “Stranger Things” episode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the murals gracing the perimeter of the space introduced a newfound form of expression to the audience, especially as it mutated underneath a projector screening psychedelic images. Musicians rotated through the line up, moving into the space one after another — transforming it into one of their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For first-time attendee Gabby Mendez, a third-year English major, the combination of setting and sound is what made her experience memorable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was on an acid trip, but I’ve never done acid,” Mendez said. “I liked that it was different from what I normally listen to, and how the variety of sounds came together to deliver something really unique.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tennessee-based Diatom Deli gathered the largest crowd, filling the room with people both standing and sitting on the floor. Carrying her talent across the West Coast on tour, her multi-instrumental sound encouraged exploration of the unconscious mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is definitely one of my favorite venues I’ve played at so far on the tour,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deli Nebletts said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I loved most about Biko was that it felt like a safe space and everyone was really welcoming, which makes the world of a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Biko House is one of five student housing Co-ops in Isla Vista that stresses the importance of inclusion while supporting a community free of discrimination. The garage space in particular functions as an all-purpose space for the community, hosting events such as art exhibitions and small concerts. The environment not only attracts performers and attendees alike, but is highly valued by those who live there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the best thing I’ve ever been apart of at UCSB and I wish I had lived at Biko last year, too,” fourth-year philosophy major Isabella D’Alessandro said. “It’s cool because things like this are so accessible, they’ve definitely been a highlight of my time here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event wouldn’t have been possible, however, without the help of Funzone. Once a location in downtown Santa Barbara, Funzone now operates through Facebook as a key organizational element for booking shows in the area. Working with radio station KCSB to promote events such as these, they are able to foster a space of music for all ages and give underheard bands a platform for exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only for high school students, but even at UCSB there are a lot of kids that are under 21 that can’t go to half of what happens downtown,” Spencer Von Hershman, Santa Barbara resident and creator of Funzone, said. “It’s a nice other option for people who don’t want to party all the time, or simply aren’t interested in partying at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing an environment that unifies similar-minded people with something that they are passionate about is the ultimate goal of performances like Wednesday evening’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just a safe place to mess around, no one here is judgemental. People want to hang out with nice people who are here to enjoy themselves and be respectful,” Von Hershman said. “Santa Barbara is a really good community for that.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/","id":6608,"author":{"id":689,"name":"Nicole Szczepanek"},"related":[6607,6606,6605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Songs to Cry to During Midterms: An Artsweek Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=450%2C450&ssl=1","description":"In honor of midterms season, Artsweek has compiled a playlist of songs that are the perfect catalyst for emotional release. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We’re finally at the halfway mark of the quarter, which means you’re working hard and deserve a good cry between weeks five and six.

It was only 30 seconds into the song and we were both already blinking back tears.

The last three minutes of pure instrumental leaves space to to pick yourself up after shedding some tears. Even though I want to “runaway as fast as [I] can” from midterms, if Kanye can push through his struggle, so can I. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lizzy Mau</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Vienna” – Billy Joel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Slow down, you crazy child,” the Piano Man cautions us in these times of chaos. Beginning with a soft piano intro, Billy Joel mimics the feeling of drinking a glass of Chardonnay in the vineyards of Vienna, Austria. In an environment of complete confusion, where it seems like we are one midterm away from pursuing a career as a fitness model that advertises protein shakes on Instagram, the song reminds us to enjoy the here and now. Considering the fact that we are never guaranteed success, the only constant we can really rely on is that place, person or activity that inspires the energy we need to get through the many stressful days. So why not partake in a little bit of self-care and just enjoy life rather than speeding through its daily motions? “Vienna” waits for you. </span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 3662px;\" width=\"675\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medlyn Grasheyella</span></i>\n<p><strong>“Ex-Factor” – Lauryn Hill</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With breakup season on the way, this classic bop is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certified</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cry. There’s something especially poignant about Lauryn Hill’s voice that makes her words carry enormous weight. Her croonings of lost love on this track are just as powerful 20 years later as they were then, and the soulful backdrop remains a timeless classic. “Ex-Factor” expresses feelings that we have all felt to some degree, whether it’s minor rejection or a world-crushing heartbreak. It’s also a bit ironic that Drake sampled this song shortly before getting exposed for hiding his child and abandoning the mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Pasion-Gonzales</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Eleanor Rigby” – The Beatles</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” still haunts me and has ever since I was five, when my dad first played it for me. Even then, before I could understand the beautiful lyrics and the heartbreaking story they tell, I could feel the sorrow in this iconic Beatles song. After hours of self-imposed isolation, studying alone in the library for your first midterms of the year, you’ll be sobbing along when Paul McCartney asks where all the lonely people come from. A lament to the hardships of the elderly and dying alone, “Eleanor Rigby” will help you let out all those stress tears when you just need to simp during stressful midterm season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucy Holley</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars” – Mitski</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna see the whole world / I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent / I wanna to see the whole world.” Was wide-eyed mortal panic was ever felt, or said, so simply? In a panic bender of less than two minutes, Mitski pins everything from interview anxiety to ideal locations for death (Jerusalem, please). Her voice is frantic, carried by an instrumental that sounds less like guitar shredding and more like a guitar literally being shredded. It’s an experience accessible only after five shots of espresso.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if my body really is made of crushed little stars (which it is, according to popular consensus), remind me why I’m stuck memorizing solubility charts at 3 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Three Little Birds” – Bob Marley</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this song is filled with encouraging lyrics, it’s perfect for that moment during midterm studying when you’re about to tap out from exhaustion and frustration, but keep telling yourself to pull through because it’ll all be over soon. In that moment, you feel like every little thing is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gonna be alright, as Bob Marley says, since your test is tomorrow and you’re still up at 2 a.m. studying (and crying). However, once “Three Little Birds” engulfs your ears through the speakers in your headphones and Marley advises you to not worry about a thing, the tears once shed out of pure misery now emerge from a place of hope. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristina Valencia</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Doomed” – Moses Sumney</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somber and haunting, “Doomed” by Moses Sumney is the perfect track for your pre-midterm breakdown (or your post-midterm GPA funeral). Questioning the possibility of being doomed to live a life without love, Sumney’s existential crisis can easily translate to a college student’s eternal pondering of whether or not one can live without good grades, a degree or a job. Lean into Sumney’s mournful lyrics and breathtaking falsetto and supplement its lack of percussion with the steady sound of slamming your head into the library table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Needle In the Hay” – Elliott Smith</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you press play and the grim chords of “Needle In the Hay” lead into Elliott Smith’s somber tone of voice, you can predict where the song is about to transport you. The track is quick in being applicable to the plethora of feelings a college student will likely experience during midterm season, meaning that it’s perfect to sob into the night before your dreaded exam. As Smith sings, we experience feeling “strung out and thin” as we attempt to cram in material before exam day, somehow not remembering anything from the past few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Singh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Tears Dry On Their Own” (Original Version)  – Amy Winehouse</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winehouse sings of her despair and feelings of regret as she begins to walk away from a lover. The pain she feels from trying to move on is especially felt in her vocals in this original version. The songstress’s vivid lyrics bring listeners back to a time when they, too, had to close a sentimental affair. The backup vocalists singing “tears dry on their own” at the end of each chorus resemble a heartbreak song from the Motown era.This song is guaranteed to leave you crying as you cope with the end of your social life during midterms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Delamare</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Rock Bottom Riser” – Smog </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you get a lead feeling in your bones, or you feel empty after the stress of exams. As I inch toward my first college midterms, I am reminded, once again, of the feeling of home — the warmth of my mother, or even my cat — and I am whole again. This song encapsulates this as I realize that this isn’t the end, that midterms won’t be the death of me and that I, too, am a rock-bottom riser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sai Sondh </span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Come Back to Earth” – Mac Miller</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac Miller’s “Come Back to Earth” from his final album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great song to cry to when stressing out over midterms. “Come Back to Earth” has poignant lyrics that focus on mental health. Miller maintains, “My regrets look just like texts I shouldn’t send … I just need a way out of my head.” I think we can all relate to sending a risky text to a friend or significant other and overthinking it, or having an endless cycle of negative thoughts. UCSB students can also relate to the lyric, “And don’t you know that sunshine don’t feel right, when you inside all day.” Who wants to be inside studying all day at the library when you could be out soaking in the sunshine or surfing at the beach?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“SUMMER”- BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the heat of the summer I had no papers to write, midterms to take or TAs who won’t email me back. At this point in fall quarter, I know the one thing we all want more than a 4.0 GPA is to go back to irresponsibly basking in the Isla Vista summer sun with all of our friends on an oceanside deck. Go ahead and give “SUMMER” by BROCKHAMPTON a listen and let that summer nostalgia sink in to the sound of wistful piano chords and guitar runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin Fauni</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“The Middle” – Jimmy Eat World</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of the quarter again. Your brain feels like that microwaved mashed potato you forgot about after all your doze-offs snowballed into two-hour naps. But if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that the best remedy for midterm melancholia is some nice, wholesome 2001 pop-punk. Still don’t understand the confusing way your calculus professor teaches u-substitution? “Just do your best, try everything you can!” Hand cramping from all the bubbling and writing? “It just takes some time!” Feeling like this class is dragging on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> longer than you’d like? “You’re in the middle of the ride, everything will be just fine, everything will be alright!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Feliciano</span></i></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;\">“No Hard Feelings” – The Avett Brothers</span></strong><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s midterm season and you feel like you’re dying, so why not listen to a song that perfectly embodies that emotion? “No Hard Feelings” by the Avett Brothers is that song. Its calming melody paired with its depressing lyrics about death is the perfect combination to induce a stream of tears. The Avett Brothers have a profound way of making music that touches the innermost core of our emotions, and this is especially true of “No Hard Feelings.” So sit back, let your existential crisis consume you and cry it out to the Avett Brothers (and their ever-present banjo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elissa Padilla</span></i></p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/","id":6633,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6632,6631,6630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Young Thug Brings Energy to Hallo-weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A.S. Program Board pulled through and succeeded yet again in another year of bringing Gauchos together during the harsh times of our annual Halloween lockdown.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Saturday night, UCSB students came together dressed in Halloween costumes to enjoy the live performances of Young Thug and Social House. While the rest of Isla Vista was busy being policed for any pre-Halloween shenanigans, the Thunderdome offered a place of refuge for those who sought amusement as Young Thug headlined this year’s Delirium concert. Organized exclusively for UCSB by A.S. Program Board, the $5 concert was once again met with a successful turnout as the crowd and performers engaged together in this loud, drunken circus of a night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once inside the Thunderdome, the floor that is usually occupied by basketball players had been transformed into a general admission concert pit, filled with sweaty, shirtless frat boys, cat ears and devil horns galore. Dedicated fans could be seen enduring the heat and absence of personal space on the main floor while others lounged in the bleacher seats upstairs waiting for Young Thug. The crowd seemed to grow more excited as 9 p.m. rolled around, with unidentifiable puffs of smoke beginning to fill the air and costumed girls searching for strangers to take Instagram-worthy photos of themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening act was Social House, a rap duo from Pittsburgh, Pa., comprised of members </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles “Scootie” Anderson and Michael “Mikey” Foster. Although this pair is relatively new to the music scene, they have already worked with and produced songs for artists like Ariana Grande and Jennifer Lopez, recently pivoting to create music of their own.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Unlike some of their hip hop contemporaries, Social House has a rather mellow sound that was clearly reflected in the crowd’s demeanor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At previous shows I’ve seen at the Thunderdome, several audience members had already been plucked out of the pit by security guards early on in the night, so it was interesting to not see that occur so soon this time. Observing a lack of chaos, Social House was quick to change that and stir up excitement by asking each side of the audience to scream louder than the other and by playing brand-new songs they had never performed live before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, at 10:37 p.m., Young Thug made his way onto the stage and was greeted with an uproar of clapping, whistling and shouts of cheer. Despite the boiling temperature inside, Thug was draped in bold fashion choices from head to toe: purple beanie, green sweater, black T-shirt, leather pants and neon green and pink high-top sneakers.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84692\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1071783414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84692\" data-attachment-id=\"84692\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/delirium_marcos-reynoso_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1770&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Delirium_Marcos Reynoso_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C786&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84692\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1-1024x906.jpg?resize=888%2C786\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C906&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening with his song “On the Run,” Young Thug skipped on stage and began jumping in sync with the students in the crowd, fostering an atmosphere that invited everyone to let loose and dance. As the show progressed, the artist brought out a number of guests to the stage, including fellow rapper Duke, who is frequently featured in songs with Young Thug.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the middle of the show, Thug climbed off stage and ran straight to the front row, directly center of the ocean of swaying, drunk Gauchos hoping to get a decent selfie with him. Despite the buckets of sweat that had now drenched every student in sight, Thug remained close to these fans for a couple minutes while he continued to rap, eventually being joined down on the floor by Duke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to “With That,” Thug performed a myriad of hits like “pick up the phone,” “Pull Up On A Kid,” “About The Money” and “Icey.” In the end, Thug concluded his set with the once popular song “Lifestyle,” which famously launched the artist into the public eye with its interestingly unclear lyrics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately after “Lifestyle” ended, Young Thug and his entourage left the stage and the main lights came back on, signaling that it was time to depart. Though the overall performances provided by both Social House and Young Thug were enough to keep concertgoers active and interested for most of the night, many seemed to be disappointed when the show ended after only 50 minutes of Thug’s rapping. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite this somewhat quick ending, A.S. Program Board pulled through and succeeded yet again in another year of bringing Gauchos together during the harsh times of our annual Halloween lockdown.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The two that stood out most, and that were constantly played, were “A Nightmare On Elm Street” and “Halloween.” Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers are two of the most timeless classic horror villains, and both have had iconic original films that impacted audiences around the world and left imprints in the nightmares of both children and adults. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common element among these films is that they both seem to have taken on exhaustingly long quests by creating an abundance of sequels which, oftentimes, did not land as well as the original. Now another trend has risen where films premier during the Halloween season hoping to become blockbusters. While the numbers in attendance may be flattering, most fail to become cult classics. I write this critique in a tentative manner after watching the latest installment of the “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series, which, although not perfect, was undoubtedly a fun, nostalgia-filled, slasher film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.” Nevertheless, hearing that wretched opening music, combined with the word “Halloween” in dripping, bright orange letters brought out a childlike reaction that had me wanting more. The “Halloween” series built itself by delivering murder scenes fueled with cynicism and other elements that are the quintessence of horror filmmaking. On the surface, Michael Myers can be seen as the average person, a slow-paced walking man wearing a mask. But it’s these details, combined with the idea that he is basically immortal (based on the many times he’s either shot in the face or burned alive), that make Myers, or the notion of him, an uncomfortable, deep-seated fear in the hearts of many. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” sticks to its guns and hovers through some of the original filmmaking tactics and classic murder sequences honed throughout the series. It’s the deadly nighttime appearances by Michael Myers and the lack of a purpose behind his rampant killing spree as he sticks his legendary chef’s knife through a random woman’s throat that keeps the audience jumping in their seats. What pushed horror films like “Halloween” out of the mainstream was the use of enhanced technology and horrific costume designs combined with the too many jump scares. This new “Halloween” undoubtedly shows director David Gordon Green’s appreciation for old-school cinematography and screenwriting. The fact that Green has chosen to stray from integrating more modern takes on horror into this new “Halloween” film is indeed ambitious, but it can also create quite a few setbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dialogue in some of the scenes of this movie are incredibly cringeworthy. Awkward pauses and panel switches feel somewhat outdated, which can be a result of Green’s choice to keep the film’s aesthetic much like the original’s. While watching “Halloween,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could not help but dwell on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliché</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plot holes about a lame high school dance and teenage romance, which are made out to be at the forefront of the film. This is all too common in slasher films — we get a variety of disposable characters and multiple plotlines that cut into the runtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best parts about this rendition, if not</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best, is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and her portrayal of  Laurie Strode. Oct. 26 marks the 40-year anniversary since the initial release of the original “Halloween” film, and she has not aged a bit. We are brought into Strode’s present life after being haunted by the traumatic experiences from her past with Myers, and she is rightfully transformed into a deadly assassin looking for vengeance. While it seems like her granddaughter (Andi Matichak) is supposed to be at the forefront of the film, Curtis steals the show. Her presence could have been utilized much more, considering most people who watched the film have a closer connection with Laurie Strode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Jamie Lee Curtis, the performances in “Halloween” are not incredible, and the movie is far from being phenomenal. However, it was entertaining and fun to have the new generation understand, at least somewhat, the importance of a character such as Michael Myers during the Halloween season. “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is meant to be a simple film, with no complex plot that requires an in-depth analysis. The hardest thing to figure out, though … is Michael Myers actually dead this time?</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

I mean, come on! In Venom’s appearances in comic books, animated movie and other forms of media, he has a spider symbol on his chest just like Spider-Man!

Shockingly enough, these aliens can’t survive in a foreign, oxygen-rich environment like Earth. Unfortunately, symbiotes can’t just bond to any organism à la blood types and organ transplants; they need to find an exact match, or the host will die within minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our reluctant hero, journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), just so happens to be an exact match. Hardy delivers an immersive experience both as Eddie Brock and Venom and also voices the titular symbiote/symbiote-human pairing. The film delves into several inconsistently paced and edited themes. At times the film is portrayed as a horror film, as a thriller and, perhaps most frequently, as an action film. Despite the sometimes inconsistent editing of the film’s themes, Hardy manifests these themes and immerses the audience in them exceptionally well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s antagonist, CEO of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), sees a world “on the brink of collapse” and wants to use these symbiotes to forcibly evolve humanity. Though his goal is somewhat noble, Drake leaves behind no moral ambiguity, considering human beings as “disposable” and willingly subjecting humans to disturbing deaths as he tries to find the key to achieving his goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigating the Life Foundation, the Venom symbiote bonds with Brock. Brock, while attempting to manage his “guest,”  is hunted down by Drake’s men as he simultaneously assesses what the symbiote is doing to him with the help of his former girlfriend, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). As the symbiote and Brock bond physically and socially, Drake bonds with another symbiote, Riot. Brock and Venom seek to stop Drake and Riot, who set out to obtain millions of symbiotes so that Riot may take over the Earth and Drake may evolve humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fight between Venom and Riot breaks out, featuring excellent cinematography, choreography and, above all, superb special effects, all of which can be seen previously in the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, there are some editing and pacing issues (sometimes creating logic holes in the film), as well as a lack of character development, but these issues are ultimately overshadowed by Tom Hardy’s stellar performance, general direction of the film, spectacular effects, choreography and cinematography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don’t particularly enjoy the film, I’d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommend staying for the scene during the closing credits.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

SG Lewis, first debuted in Santa Barbara with a DJ set in The Hub. Last Wednesday night marked his return, although this time the 24-year-old <span class=\"s1\">performed </span>a brand new live show and brought an arsenal of new tunes with him, showcasing <span class=\"s1\">just</span> how far his music <span class=\"s1\">has progressed in a single year</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show was set against dark brick walls that define SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club’s industrial interior in downtown Santa Barbara. On stage was a basic five-piece band setup that sat atop a large, intricately designed carpet, dimly lit by a chilling mixture of blue and green lights. It was an effortless and simple design, but alluring <span class=\"s1\">nonetheless</span> <span class=\"s1\">—</span> one that sp<span class=\"s1\">oke</span> well to Lewis’<span class=\"s1\">s </span>style of electronic music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Walking inside the venue, I noticed that the initial energy and excitement for Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show seemed lacking. For <span class=\"s1\">nearly </span>an hour, people lingered between aRod’s opening set and the bar, although most hovered around the bar until <span class=\"s1\">right </span>before Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> performance. Perhaps the Wednesday night drink specials distracted from the usual pre-show excitement but, regardless, as soon as the lights shut off and the infectious build-up of “Coming Up” started playing, the energy flipped.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">“Coming Up” was one of two singles released from Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> <i>Dusk</i> EP, which came out earlier this year in April.

First <span class=\"s1\">come </span>the feelings of anticipation and excitement for what’s to come<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">then</span> the sort of high-energy peak felt at the top of the night and<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">finally,</span> the downtempo comedown that follows that energy.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show last week served as an introductory experience to the musical expression of synerg<span class=\"s1\">y</span> between every different phase of a night out. Even on a Wednesday night, by curating a set that sonically builds, peaks and <span class=\"s1\">subsequently </span>comes back down<span class=\"s1\">, Lewisb guided </span>audience members through the exact journey of emotion and energy that inspired his upcoming album.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Transitioning from “Coming Up” into some of his upbeat tracks like “All Night” and “Better” (<span class=\"s1\">featuring</span> rising electropop star Clairo) solidified the vibe of the first phase. As more people crowded closer to the stage, it was evident that excitement was rising <span class=\"s1\">as </span>each song played. Needless to say, the previously off-putting <span class=\"s1\">atmosphere that filled the club </span>no longer existed in the presence of Lewis, who was accompanied by two other instrumentalists and a captivating duo of vocalists.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then, songs with heavier overtones like “Times We had” and “Smart Aleck Kill” <span class=\"s1\">furthered the crowd’s excitement and</span> <span class=\"s1\">brought </span>them closer to t<span class=\"s1\">he</span> peak energy level that Lewis likely wanted<span class=\"s1\">. In order to maintain that level of enthusiasm, he dropped</span> his most recent banger, “Hurting,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> with fellow Brit AlunaGeorge. <span class=\"s1\">A</span>t this point <span class=\"s1\">in</span> the night, the room was noticeably hotter, people were sweatier and the crowd was moving more groovily than ever.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But, a return to the slow magic of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>signature sound <span class=\"s1\">was </span>what truly <span class=\"s1\">tied</span> th<span class=\"s1\">is whole</span> sonic experience together. Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>sound is deeply mellow and introspective. It’s moody, minimal and full of synth — but also commanding<span class=\"s1\"> and</span> strong.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">His style<span class=\"s1\"> differentiates him from</span> the higher BPMs usually associated with EDM and, even more so, from the headbanging trap, bumpy house and tir<span class=\"s1\">i</span>ng future bass that currently dominates most electronic scenes. However, <span class=\"s1\">he has proved that </span>this does not make his music any less danceable or invigorating. In fact, it’s what landed him alongside U.K. powerhouse names like Disclosure and Jessie Ware at PMR Records in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What is so interesting about<span class=\"s1\"> Lewis’s show and his </span>latest project is how definitive it is of his multifaceted musicality. His ability to pull from a multitude of influences — whether <span class=\"s1\">it be </span>disco, East Coast hip-hop, R&amp;B or indie — and still maintain the cool and calm composure <span class=\"s1\">which </span>characterizes his niche in electronic music is fascinating.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Ending with “Warm,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> a slow-burning tune he impressively sang himself, and an encore comprised of both an unreleased track <span class=\"s1\">and </span>“Yours,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> Lewis truly encapsulated the crowd in the sort of sentiments that define the end of a night out <span class=\"s1\">—</span> bittersweet and empty, <span class=\"s1\">but </span>also a longing for <span class=\"s1\">the peak’s sweet return</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis has proven <span class=\"s1\">his ability to master a</span> myriad of sounds<span class=\"s1\">,</span> and if Wednesday night was any indicator of how effective his forthcoming album will be in telling the narrative he <span class=\"s1\">intends</span>, I<span class=\"s1\"> a</span>m positive he <span class=\"s1\">will be successful</span>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/","id":6627,"author":{"id":685,"name":"Austin Fauni"},"related":[6626,6625,6624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Young Thug To Headline Delirium 2018","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/young-thug-square.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/young-thug-square.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Superstar rapper and contemporary poet Young Thug has been announced as the headliner for Delirium, the annual Halloween show from A.S.

Program Board. Young Thug is set to showcase his freeform, hypnotic hooks to the Thunderdome on Oct. 27th. Thug is one of the founding architects who built the modern Atlanta rap scene, which emphasizes ad-libbing techniques and using one’s voice throughout the song as a versatile instrument.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I don’t care about people understanding me; I do it [music and fashion] for the weird ones,” Thug shared in a 2016 interview with <i>XXL</i>. Thug is an enigma. He rarely gives sit-down interviews with publications and only seems to showcase his personality via sporadic Instagram Live sessions. Even when Thug made a surprise appearance at Velvet Jones in late April to support fellow YSL-labelmate Gunna, he remained reserved and didn’t let his rockstar presence outshine his friend’s performance. But his unique music and eccentric fashion sense allude to the parts of his persona that are often kept hidden away.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Thug recently released the YSL-compilation <i>Slime Language</i> and the EP <i>On the Rvn</i>, both containing examples of Thug animatedly rapping over hints of pop embellishments. The track “High” from <i>On The Rvn </i>features Thug rapping, “All I got is a chicken for the thots” on a reworking of Elton John’s “Rocket Man.” Thug is at the apex of genre-defying music, as he often intermingles his creative sensibilities by rapping alongside the likes of pop princess Ariana Grande and indie producer Jamie XX.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">He has dabbled in the art of making a rap-country album with <i>Beautiful Thugger Girls</i>, which offers its fair share of love songs and anthems dealing with strife and drug dependency. <i>Barter 6 </i>is emblematic of Young Thug’s blond era, which brought the Birdman collab “Constantly Hating” and the romantic feature “Amazing” with R&amp;B crooner Jacquees. Thug’s cult-like following is undoubtedly due to his creativity as an artist. Even if you don’t think you would like attending a Thugger show, there’s at least one song in his discography that you can bop your head to.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For those who believe they are unfamiliar with Young Thug’s impressive catalog, you probably recall slight memories of hearing “Relationship” featuring Future in a backyard party on Trigo Road in Isla Vista, or an onslaught of Vines from 2014 featuring the rapper’s collab with Rich Homie Quan, “Lifestyle.” Travis Scott has also featured the rapper on “Pick Up the Phone,” “Mamacita” and “Maria, I’m Drunk.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">People often retreat to meme-ifying Thug’s presence and musicianship, yet Thug continues to punctuate his projects with inventiveness. He does not fit into the mold of what some people base their perceptions of rap on, but that is what makes him stellar.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Despite the news about Thug refraining from releasing music until 2019 in solidarity for his deaf brother, Thug has released a series of projects and features in 2018 and is hinting at the long-awaited release of<i> Barter 7</i>. Thug is at the helm of the new era of rappers turned rockstars, constantly reinventing himself while keeping the loyalty of hardcore fans. Thug will undoubtedly turn the Thunderdome into a frenzied playground of rap hits and booming basslines.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

another year of stoner hippie magic, the Desert Daze music festival left quite a mark on its attendees this year. With exciting headliners such as indie gods Tame Impala, classic shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine, and Australian psych-pop band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, this three-day festival seemed like the perfect escape into a psychedelic wonderland.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As I was driving myself out to Lake Perris, Desert Daze’s new location, I got a phone call from one of my housemates telling me that she had been waiting in line for parking for over an hour. By the time I finally made it all the way out there myself, I recognized instantly what she was talking about. The line of cars waiting to get into the festival spanned over a mile or two until you couldn’t see where the line ended.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Eventually, I noticed more and more people either turning their cars completely off because of the stand-still, inescapable traffic or sparking up some joints to pass the time while they remained prisoners in their cars. Jocelyn Guardado (@GuardadoJocelyn) even wrote via Twitter, “First and last desert daze. Car ran out [of] gas from the long line. I love waiting in this heat so that my boyfriend can walk two miles to the nearest gas station.” Although Guardado’s case is unfortunate, several others claimed to have waited as long as four hours and still missed most of the Friday performances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">Once inside the venue, it was clear the anger from trying to park had vanished and most festival goers were once again excited for the music. Although Desert Daze, as the name mentions, is normally held in a desert setting, the festival this year made its debut at Lake Perris. It gave off an adult summer camp feel, with campsites across the lot, a beach to swim in and an amazing view of the Moreno Beach mountains. Festival attendees could be seen frolicking in the water as bands played their sets right next to them. In addition to the beauty of Mother Nature that engulfed Desert Daze, several fun food vendors and other booths were scattered throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Like Coachella and other music festivals, Desert Daze had multiple stages: the Moon, the Block, the Theatre, the Sanctuary and the Mystic Bazaar. Besides the Bazaar, which was for campers only, each stage was relatively close to one another, making it easy for attendees to hop from band to band and view insane, Instagram-worthy art installations along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Although it was apparent most attendees were mainly excited to see Tame Impala, the rest of the bands on the Friday lineup didn’t disappoint. Lesser known artists like Idles, Hinds and Jarvis Cocker shone as old and new fans alike were captivated by their performances, often taking small breaks from dancing to light up and drink. More interestingly, though, was the performance of Warpaint, who took the stage right before Tame Impala. Their psych-rock sound, in combination with the feminine edge that comes exclusively from a girls-only band, seemed to call each person to the stage with their hits like “Elephants,” “Undertow” and “Disco//Very.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As the sun began to set on the first night of Desert Daze, the weather became noticeably colder and more people could be seen retreating to their cars to grab jackets, hats and more joints. Though the main stage had been previously occupied by fans enjoying the sets of Warpaint and Pond a couple hours earlier, the Moon Stage was now filled to the max with agonizing anticipation of Tame Impala’s performance. However, it wasn’t until lightning started to strike that the excitement grew.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Scheduled to perform at 10 p.m., Tame Impala entered the stage about 10 minutes late, beginning with their song “Nangs” accompanied by trippy, psychedelic visual art that covered the screens surrounding the band. As the rain began to pick up and lightning became more frequent, Tame Impala quickly jumped into “Let It Happen,” inciting the whole crowd to collectively jump and sway their heads side to side to the familiar and well-loved song. As the long instrumental break blared out of the speakers, my view of Kevin Parker diminished as I got lost in a cloud of weed and vape smoke coming from my fellow standing neighbors.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While Tame Impala played for as long and well as they could, they were no match for the storm that was to come. The flashes of lightning continued to get so much brighter and more frequent than before that festival attendees began enjoying the scene, fully immersing themselves in the chaos of music and nature combining into one coherent experience. So, when the music stopped after 20 minutes and Parker said, “Sorry guys, we gotta go,” it was clear no one had anticipated this short ending. One of the festival coordinators then came out and assured fans that Tame Impala would come back out after the weather cleared up but that everyone was urged to seek shelter in cars or buildings. In the end, though, the Tame set was canceled as well as every other act scheduled to perform after them — and fans were pissed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">In an attempt to make up for the unforeseen weather disturbances during Friday, Desert Daze gave everyone free parking for the weekend and allowed attendees with Friday tickets to enjoy the festival on Saturday as well at no extra charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When Saturday morning finally came around, the rain, lightning and thunder had ceased, creating a cool forecast for festival goers to enjoy throughout the rest of the weekend. To close the show, Death Grips and My Bloody Valentine performed back-to-back, giving audience members unique takes on what psychedelic music can sound like. While Death Grips gave a rather exciting performance, never taking any breaks during their set, My Bloody Valentine really brought it home with their signature garage rock playing that incited enormous response from the crowd. This was especially apparent during their song “Soon,” to which many fans began jumping and throwing elbows and fists as a form of dancing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Though there were some pretty big hiccups with the organization and execution of this festival, Desert Daze still gave its attendees a great playground to meet new people, camp, swim and, of course, enjoy the music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hopefully, they will look at the weather report next year!</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Every time I see an emotionally-charged movie with my friends, I gloat about not shedding a single tear, even at the most heart-wrenching, gut-turning scenes. But I’m not ashamed to say I cried while watching “A Star Is Born.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps it’s a testament to the film’s ability to hit every nerve and proof that it was made with every kind of modern-day music lover in mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bradley Cooper, who also directed and produced the film, plays disenchanted country singer Jackson Maine in earnest, performing all of the songs and even earning a few writing credits on the soundtrack. His story with Ally, played by Lady Gaga, is one of the classic boy-meets-girl variety. In fact, this is the third incarnation of the “Star is Born” screenplay. Lately, it does feel like Hollywood is taking advantage of the remake and reboot format – but in Cooper’s hands, this old story feels fresh again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Maine character is a believable portrayal of an old-soul artist with deep-rooted demons. Sometimes the music helps his issues with drugs and alcohol, but more often than not, his dependency is exacerbated by his obligations to withstand long periods of time on the road for tours and an almost constant disconnection from normalcy. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a surprise: Cooper can sing. Very well. The country-tinged rock songs that his character became famous for sound like they were written for the stage, not the silver screen – which is a good thing. Cooper and co. enlisted the talents of Lukas Nelson, son of Willie Nelson, and alt-country auteur Jason Isbell to assist with the movie’s sound. Maine’s world-weary lyrics paired with his slightly weathered voice are a stunning creation by Cooper and makes for a dynamic fictional artist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga plays opposite Cooper and shines just as bright as the veteran actor in her first movie role. Of course, her portrayal of Ally mirrors some of the aspects of her real-life rise to fame. After singing in New York clubs for a number of years, she was discovered multiple times, but ran into more than a few roadblocks during her search for stardom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was criticized for her appearance, her sound and her songwriting – all things that Ally confronts during her own story arc. After Maine discovers Ally singing an enchanting rendition of “La Vie en Rose” in a drag bar, they soon find themselves swept into a whirlwind of success on each other’s behalf. Ally is skeptical of Maine’s insistence that she’ll make it. You can see a young Gaga in this character, loathing her mousy brown hair and prominent nose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is undeniable on screen and in the melding of their voices in song. Although the “Poker Face” singer is famous for her high-energy dance tracks, she was classically trained in her teenage years. Her voice is strong and instantly recognizable, but never overpowering. Although she begins her career by singing ballads with Maine, Ally eventually finds her way to pop. At one point, Maine tells Ally to ‘dig down into’ her soul for the music and never lose sight of who she is. But there’s an inherent negativity toward her newfound stardom and her sound that caters toward popular music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its glossy sheen and overt theatrics, pop music can still come from a place of authenticity. Lady Gaga the pop star is a wonderful example of this. Of course, she’s famous for the antics of her early career, like wearing dresses made of meat. But you never got the feeling that it wasn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, craziness and all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an electric chemistry between Cooper and Gaga that makes them believable as artists and a couple. The film never felt cheesy or forced because of this match, which is what makes “A Star is Born” so damn impressive. Of course, we’re rooting for Maine and Ally, but we’re able to get angry with them when they create chaos for themselves, or when they make the wrong decisions when it comes to each other. It’s easier to love characters that are imperfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cried for the sadness that Maine feels. I cried for Ally, a young woman who is forced to choose time and time again between love and her career. We know these stories by heart now, the real versions. But it takes a screen to magnify them, to show us what artists have to sacrifice to give us the art. We consume it, and we only think about their struggles when they’re laid out in front of us.

Cuco started out by uploading his Spanish melodies to Bandcamp in 2015. His popularity soared with the release of his 2017 single “Lo Que Siento,” a track in which he discusses dreaming of love when he’s alone. His lyrics are seamless — even though alternating lines can be in different languages, English or Spanish, the song still flows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many students of the UCSB population, Cuco grew up in southwest L.A. county as a first-generation Mexican-Americanand can relate to many Dreamers here on campus. The artist is leading by example and through his music, exemplifying that being a Dreamer can make you stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco also identifies with and advocates for members of the LGBTQ+ community. “But what I think is cool also is that I see more artists of color not just coming from Mexican descent but different orientations with their sexuality and gender identity,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pigeons &amp; Planes, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he shared his humble start as a young independent artist: “I never had connections at any point to the industry. Like, my life was like literally going to school, watching my mom clean houses, my dad driving limos and every other weekend having a guitar … This is raw, this is me,” the artist said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco is not motivated by money or “making it big” with a record label; he’s doing music because that’s what he’s always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84210\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"899396935\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84208\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84210\" data-attachment-id=\"84210\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/marcos-reynoso_cuco_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1281%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1281,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Marcos Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84210\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3-656x1024.jpg?resize=656%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1199&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is Cuco following his creative aspirations, but he’s also helping his parents along the way: “Growing up, any first-generation child’s dream is literally always, ‘I want to help my parents out. I need to get my parents out of working. I want to pay my parents’ mortgage off. I want to get my parents out,’ and that’s hopefully what I’m going to do.” He’s making his parents proud not only through his music or success but also through his motivation to bring them up with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fusing traditional Latinx music with contemporary indie, Cuco is bridging the gap between the two genres and, in turn, creating his own musical niche. His eclectic sound is not like anything on the charts now. He took a risk keeping close to his roots, and it paid off. His sound melds old influence with his own beats, creating his personalized flare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many in the audience connected to his music, even though he is still slightly hesitant to fully embrace his craft. “I don’t know if y’all are going to vibe with my music, but sing this shit with me, alright?” Cuco asked as the audience erupted with cheers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being approached by record labels, Cuco has resisted, standing strong as an independent artist. Even though many refer to his music as “dream” or “bedroom pop,” Cuco’s music cannot be fully defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco has broken barriers not only with his music but also with his messages of tolerance, acceptance and self-love. “I feel like people hate that I’m a guy and I’m making this, like, super soft music,” he once explained, “so I like seeing really big white buff dudes looking all pissed at me because I’m on stage being successful and brown.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/","id":6630,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6629,6628,6627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miguel Closes Out Summer at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage presence of Miguel is articulate and precise, alarmingly reminiscent of the way Michael Jackson used to move about the stage and command his audience’s attention. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the first day of school at UCSB just around the corner, many Santa Barbarans chose to wrap up the summer with a night of innovative,  latin-inspired pop music from Miguel and his openers at the gorgeous outdoor venue of the Santa Barbara Bowl. With support from Nonchalant Savant and OVO signee DVSN, this performance from Miguel’s “The Ascension Tour” was as rehearsed, focused and high-energy as possible, with clear precision and performative value that is practiced, methodical and passionate. This show from Miguel demands acknowledgement of the strength in his entire discography and his long future to come in the music industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DVSN took the stage in preparation for Miguel, and the simple stage setup of three background singers and vocalist Daniel Daley with a mic set the focus solely on vocal prowess, something that Dvsn is very akin to. He performed a wide array of tracks from his three projects, showcasing his extremely wide range of vocal ability, namely his gorgeously high falsetto voice. Midway through his set, Dvsn had his DJ play some classic 90s R&amp;B for the crowd to dance to, which seemingly was a highlight but came off as a cheaper attempt to gain attention from the audience. Despite this, DVSN’s stage presence is undeniable, and the OVO wave of R&amp;B seems to be in good hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel took the stage around 9:15 with a full band, backup singers and a staircase set in the middle of the stage, in alignment with other variations of Ascension to come. He opened with various cuts from new album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including “Banana Clip” and “Harem,” all performed with instrumental variations and a free range of vocal runs. The rock-inspired electric guitar elements in his music play a much bigger role in a live context, as the sharp riffs cut through the air and added powerful sound to the performance. Miguel would later explain that the set is divided into three stages, ending in full ascension in which him and the audience “skywalk,” concluding with his career’s biggest hit, “Sky Walker.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

He had constant choreographed dance moves along to the beat of his tracks and with background dancers behind him. The consistent jumps, hip movements and flails in sync with drum fills, guitar licks and beat switch-ups were crisp, clean and exciting. He began to lose momentum, however, whenever he addressed the crowd directly. His constant rambling about “energy,” “meditation” and the “spirituality” of his performance came off as baseless, as Miguel’s image has always been more lighthearted and transparent as a neo-pop artist. Also, his constant priming of the audience for the performance of “Skywalker” seemed to be a ploy for audience attention. Frequently asking the crowd “Are you guys ready to Skywalk?” after every few songs seemed to have the opposite effect from what was intended. Despite this, the purely musical aspects of the performance were impeccable, with strong instrumentation, vocals and choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the set Miguel played a variety of older cuts from previous albums such as sex anthem “Arch and Point,” hit single “Adorn,” the self critique “So I Lied” and the revered, albeit controversial track “Do You…” (like drugs?). In cautious fashion, Miguel made a point to follow up the latter track with a disclaimer that all drugs should be done safely and in moderation, a slightly cringeworthy yet necessary message, given the state of drug use in popular music today. I assumed, as I’m sure many in the crowd did, that Miguel would take some time to honor past collaborator Mac Miller after his passing, but unfortunately that moment was not taken during the performance. This functions as evidence that, in the midst of growing older and more mature, Miguel has been at a crossroads in navigating his image of edgy sex and drug icon and his wise creative persona, and he may not know what kind of image he wants to sell at this point in his career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set ended with more cuts from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the Kali Uchis Spanish cut “Carmelo Duro” and dreamy landscape “Pineapple Skies.” He concluded his set, as predicted by himself and the audience, with his mega-hit “Sky Walker,” a moment that perhaps felt reduced after the previous hour of hyping it up. Regardless, the track was performed elegantly and with maximum response from the crowd, as “Sky Walker” marks one of the most energetic and fun songs of Miguel’s career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was more than pleased with the celebration of music, maturity and freedom that Miguel delivered at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Despite some flaws in his monologue and constant references to “Sky Walking,” the entire crowd was happy with his musical execution. Miguel is clearly aware of his talent and potential and will not hesitate to utilize these to the fullest of his ability. As the tour name suggests, Miguel has nowhere to go but up.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

groundbreaking about Troye Sivan’s journey. He has all the trappings of a star: a legion of loyal fans, a model boyfriend and muse status in the eyes of countless fashion designers. What’s groundbreaking is Sivan’s grasp on maturity and queer identity while simultaneously producing radio-ready tracks on par with today’s brightest stars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An openly gay Australian pop sensation, Sivan took a fairly conventional route to fame. A product of his time, Sivan first rose to prominence on YouTube, accumulating millions of subscribers with his daily vlogs. By the age of 18, Sivan came out publicly in a video, which now has over eight million views. He soon transitioned from YouTube to the music industry, in typical Disney Channel star fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first album, 2015’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighborhood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saw Sivan tackle the struggles of coming of age and coming out. The synth-pop album captures the highs and lows of adolescence, hitting all the usual boxes: unrequited love, identity issues and even the trappings of the suburbs. It’s the kind of album that could score every scene in a high school rom-com, with its highest charting single appropriately titled “YOUTH.” While the album showed the promise of Sivan’s eventual star status, its uneven pacing and crowded tracklisting reflected his rookie nature. Sivan still needed to do a little growing in order to find his true voice. Now, in 2018, Sivan is in full bloom.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, released Aug. 30, reveals Sivan as a fully defined popstar, confident in his own queer identity and powerful with his own voice. Troye rides the recent wave of “poptimism,” following the likes of Ariana Grande’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweetener </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Lorde’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melodrama</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, harnessing the fun and brightness of pop music in order to produce an album that is genuinely enjoyable to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Seventeen,” bridges the gap between his first and second releases as Sivan recounts his first sexual experience as a 17-year-old. The heartbreaking song tells of Sivan being lured into a meetup with an older man on Grindr. Sivan sings of the experience from a perspective that one only gains from actually growing up as he explores the motivations of his younger self: “I went out looking for love when I was 17 / Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me.” Rather than dwell on the emotions and politics of the moment, Sivan focuses on the curiosity and loneliness that drove him to the exchange. The thoughtful retrospective captures the naivety of youth and the mistakes that insecurity and instability can cause. However, Sivan is no longer that naive, lonely, gay teen and sings from a newly found perspective of wisdom and maturity. Sivan has already done his growing and is ready to showcase what it means to be fully formed, confident and queer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MY MY MY!” does just that, following Sivan onto the dance floor, where he commands attention with ease: “Don’t make me wait another day / ‘Cause passion is passion / You know it just as well as me.” Troye alternates seductive whispers and a booming chorus accompanied by an uptempo dance-ready beat. “MY MY MY!” shows Sivan at his sexiest as he coaxes the object of his affection into his arms. The music video released with the track captures Sivan’s command of his newly found sex symbol status, as he dances fully unabridged and fully queer in an abandoned warehouse, accompanied by shirtless men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan imbues this electrifying, bright, optimistic energy to the rest of album, which alternates ballads and bangers. The titular track, “Bloom,” finds itself on the upbeat side as Sivan not so subtly references “bottoming.” As with the rest of album, Sivan gives little worry to the binaries of sexuality and gender, speaking freely about a topic that has been given little freedom to be expressed in popular culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another upbeat highlight is Sivan’s collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Dance To This.” The two combine forces to deliver an ode to staying in rather than going out. At a time when Grande has never been bigger, Sivan manages to keep the spotlight evenly balanced between the two stars, as their angelic voices combine to create a soothing club track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s evolution as an artist is most obvious when he is at his most understated and vulnerable. Rather than pushing each track to emotional explosion and relying on catharsis to imbue effect, Sivan allows himself to shine in his most breathy, low-key moments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acoustic ballad, “The Good Side,” showcases Sivan’s sweetness, as the mature relationship retrospective emphasizes respect and empathy over the pettiness breakups often go hand-in-hand with. Meanwhile, “Animal,” an experimental ballad ripe with desire and longing, slowly builds until a Frank Oceanic release ends the song in euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s bright, fruitful and flowery imagery subverts the typical masculine pop archetype, perhaps ushering in a new era of artists who reject toxic masculinity and embrace vulnerability. Sivan produces imagery based on the queer experience; however, his masterful pop music is for everyone. Each song on the 10 track listing leaves a bright, harmonious and euphoric feeling in the ears of listeners, signifying Sivan’s rightful place among today’s hitmakers. Perhaps because of society’s slowly changing views on sexuality and gender, there has never been an openly queer artist quite so poised for mainstream success like Sivan. And with Sivan’s razor-sharp execution of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it seems like he’s more than ready to rise to the occasion.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

–– are artists delightfully worthwhile and arguably matching in talent, known as the sleepers. Perhaps the most “slept on,” or often unrecognized of this group of unsung talent is the dark horse of pop, the Latin response to American music, Miguel. Coming off of an incredibly focused and high energy fourth project “War and Leisure,” from 2017, Miguel has been on the road as of late for his “Ascension Tour,” of North America. The tour, presumably named with relation to his hit single “Sky Walker,” has already worked its’ way West across the United States, and will be hitting the Santa Barbara Bowl this Friday the 21st. After a year of touring off of his recent success, and with special guest DVSN along the way for this stretch, the SB Bowl stage is set for a wavy end to the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel first rose to prominence in 2010 with his debut studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All I Want is You</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was met with positive critical acclaim and common recognition of Miguel as one of R&amp;B’s up and comers. His next album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaleidoscope Dream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which came two years later, further cemented Miguel as a force to be reckoned with in music, and even earned him a Grammy for the projects opening track “Adorn.” It wasn’t until his 2014 strong shift </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, that he really earned universal recognition for his artistry and creative bravery. A highlight in his career, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was much more raw, edgy, electronic, and gritty than any of his previous work. The album was released behind a multitude of daunting singles, including the rock influenced “Hollywood Dreams,” and upbeat dream hit “coffee,” also paired with a Wale remix appropriately titled “Coffee (F***ing)”. It also featured hit track “the valley,” a raw and deeply sexual pulse that feels reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails “Closer.” The haunting 808’s and intense lyrical imagery throughout worked to function as a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeezus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-esque mark to his discography, taking a sharp but poignant left turn musically and proving the diversity of the promising musician.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This of course leads us to Miguel’s most recent work which is by far his most positive, dreamy, and refined of his career, the feel good answer to his darkness of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 2017 powerhouse of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

all-female quartet with a unique kind of spice and punch unmatched by anyone else in the current indie music scene. What sets Hinds apart from so many others is their spirit that they successfully manage to communicate through their lo-fi, garage rock sound. Focused more on making music they enjoy rather than creating what seems to be the most profitable sound, Hinds fully embodies what it means to be fun, confident and carefree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresh off the release of their second studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Don’t Run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hinds will be taking the stage of Santa Barbara’s very own SOhO on Sept. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many other indie bands, Hinds got their start on Bandcamp with the original band name “Deers,” which was comprised of founding members Carlotta Cosials and Ana Garc</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ía Perrote. In 2014, their EP “Demo” gained them significant recognition after receiving approval from magazines like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NME</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and various musicians like Patrick Carney of The Black Keys and fellow European band The Pastels. Since then, Cosials and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perrote</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who both contribute vocals and guitar, have added two new members to the group: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ade Mart</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ín on bass and Amber Grimbergen on drums.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they admit they’re not super popular in their home of Madrid, Spain, Hinds has gained significant success in other places like Australia and the United States. Since 2015, these ladies have collaborated with other bands like The Parrots, sold exclusive limited edition merch at Urban Outfitters and played in multiple music festivals like South by Southwest and Burgerama. During a live performance on Seattle radio station KEXP, Cosials even recalls their experience of South by Southwest by explaining, “We did 16 shows in four days, we’re so proud of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With influences like Mac DeMarco, The Strokes, Ty Segall and The Vaccines, these ladies know how to create a groovy tune while simultaneously attacking their music and lyrics with a raw, feminine edge. Their newest album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Don’t Run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explores the difficulties and confusions that come with falling in love and presents its listener with rather realistic feelings of self-doubt, longing and vulnerability. For example, their leading single from this sophomore album, “New For You,” describes a desire to become a new, better version of yourself in the name of love. Lyrics like “Because I wanna be somebody new for you” and “Because I only wanna dream if you’re by my side” display a serious love and commitment for someone in the simplest way possible. As seen similarly throughout their entire discography, these Hinds lyrics cut right to the point and make it clear what they want to say. It’s because of this naivety and simplicity of theirs that so many fans are able to let loose, rock out to their music and feel a real connection to the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hinds is far from being the perfect band, their potential for greatness is as apparent as the sky is blue. It’s uncertain whether these Spanish gals will take over the charts in the near future, but it is clear their mere presence in the male-dominated music industry stands as an inspiration for female artists everywhere.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-83945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Bandcamp</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski Miyawaki has outdone herself. The singer-songwriter, known mononymously as Mitski, released her fifth studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">via Dead Oceans on August 17 to seemingly unanimous critical acclaim. In an album so aesthetically different from her prior works, Mitski proves that she does not need to lean on her lo-fi indie rock niche, as she breaks out of her classic use of vocal overlays and grainy tracks as heard on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Puberty 2 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bury Me At Makeout Point</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski is one of the rare artists who can articulate feelings so complex, that trying to formulate the words to describe them usually seems futile. She isn’t afraid to broadcast emotions and desires that seem ugly or taboo because she knows everybody else feels them, too. That’s what makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such a standout: Every relationship is unique, but the corresponding feelings remain universal, and Mitski chooses to lean into the discomfort with an unflinching candor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Geyser,” is one of Mitski’s more cohesive songs with her previous work. The album begins with a hazy intro and the yearning lyrics, “You’re my number one / You’re the one I want / And you’ve turned down / Every hand that has beckoned me to come.” Unlike many of her other tracks, Mitski admitted in an interview with NPR that “Geyser” breaks from her traditional use of narrative and instead is “all feeling.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem to reference a lover, Mitski sings of her relationship with music and her career. Being an artist has led to her sacrifice of her physical and mental health and her relationships with other people. She skillfully personifies music as a partner, thus allowing “Geyser” to remain wholly relatable, even for those who are not so musically inclined. She ends the song with the woeful, “I will be the one you need / I just can’t be without you,” which is indicative of any passionate — maybe even unhealthy — relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second song on the album, “Why Didn’t You Stop Me?” portrays a self-centered desire for an ex. In this narrative Mitski finds herself feeling regretful after ending things with her partner. “I know I ended it, but / Why won’t you chase after me?” she asks. As the song continues it becomes clear that Mitski has a distorted perception of her partner and the relationship they had together, as she sings, “I look for a picture of you / To keep in my pocket / But I can’t seem to find one / Where you look how I remember / Look how I remember.” It seems incredibly bold for an artist to shed light on a relationship in a way that lacks a whimsical and nostalgic element. While the music may retain these undertones, the lyrics tell a different story of warped ideas of other people and even of ourselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most relatable track on the entire album, Mitski delves into the sentiment behind trying to settle the score with an ex on “Lonesome Love.” She sings of putting on makeup and high heels to prove to her ex that she has moved on and is thriving, but upon seeing them immediately softens and completely loses the upper hand. The melody shifts from an upbeat acoustic guitar to a more solemn tone as she mournfully sings, “‘Cause nobody butters me up like you / And nobody fucks me like me.” Mitski manages to completely gut her listeners (and all in under two minutes) as she relays a story that may feel all too familiar to many. She ends the song on a solemn note: “Why am I lonely for lonesome love? / Why am I lonely?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to her incredible vocals, Mitski is also a profound lyricist. She shows off some of her best songwriting chops on album-standout “Nobody.” Juxtaposed with the upbeat music, the strikingly sad lyrics once again touch on feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Possibly the most insightful verse on the entire album, Mitski compares her own desires to the greenhouse gases on the planet Venus: “Venus, planet of love / Was destroyed by global warming / Did its people want too much too? / Did its people want too much?” Breaking from the abstract she goes onto sing, “And I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me.” On this particular verse, Mitski explained that she views pity as the “emotion you have for someone who’s, like, lower than you. I don’t want your fucking pity…Don’t judge me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so much available content about relationships and all that comes with them, Mitski still finds a way to offer a refreshing take. The album is so densely packed with hits that touching on all of them would simply be too lofty an effort. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proves to be Mitski’s magnum opus. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
