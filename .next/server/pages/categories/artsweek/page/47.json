A virtuoso is defined as “a person highly skilled with special knowledge in various artistic pursuits” and this year’s crew had no shortage of special talents. The honorees included Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”), Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”), J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”), Logan Lerman (“Fury”), David Oyelowo (“Selma”), Chadwick Boseman (“Get on Up”) and Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> was exclusively among the journalistic press on the red carpet and spoke to every honoree before they received their grand award.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Growing up, did you have similar experiences as your character, Mason in “Boyhood?”</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, I mean a lot of them, more and less. I was homeschooled so what I was doing was kind of different, but emotionally and psychological, definitely. I was always kind of right there with Mason … that was an incredible outlet to have, everything I went through, and you’re trying to figure out so much, especially as a teenager, and [I was] able to take those things in fiction and look at them somewhat subjectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What do you remember when you were six years old auditioning for this film?</p>\n<p>A: I remembered it was a long audition process and Richard didn’t have the script written or anything. So it wasn’t like most auditions where you go and read lines. It’s just kind of an understanding, he was trying to get to know me … I brought in art and he talked to my parents and it was very casual.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara. What is your impression of the SB so far?</p>\n<p>A: I had a great time so far. I came up early yesterday morning, we spent a day on beach, had a picnic [and I] went to La Supa Rica last night with my partner. My two sons [are] here, so we’ve just been building sand castles and playing in the waves; it’s wonderful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: This role is such a revolutionary role for women in Hollywood. How does it feel to be chosen to play such a complex character?</p>\n<p>A: It’s just a film about women empowerment, with a bit of murder thrown in for good measure. But take out the murder and a lot of it is about women empowerment. She is sort of an unusual woman who in different circumstances could have been [a] genuinely exceptional human being. It’s just that she has this sort of misplaced sense of entitlement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I think the point is she is not a monster. She is just sort of [a monster], for the sake of a screenwriter having fun writing this villainous character. [But] she’s totally grounded in reality; I know exactly where she comes from. It’s just the extreme we’re not used to seeing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to shoot these scenes over and over again? I know David Fincher and he’s a perfectionist.</p>\n<p>A: Well I am [a perfectionist] too, so we had a meeting in mind on the part. I never mind[ed] how many times I had to do it; I’d rather get it right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like filming that particular scene with Neil Patrick Harris?</p>\n<p>A: That’s the nature of David Fincher filming: his foresight, his planning was like a military operation. We’d do one scene and it [would] be a blood bath, the sides of the set would go up, and the bed would be wheeled out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How many showers did you take for the scene?</p>\n<p>A: 47 or something.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’re such a champion for English designers. Will we be seeing some more English designers for future red carpets, especially at the Oscars?</p>\n<p>A: I’m not going to give anything away but in the near future you will see some English designers coming soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What did you see in this role of Fletcher that first drew you in?</p>\n<p>A: Everything that an actor is looking for in a part is telling a compelling story, and [playing] a character that I can really sink my teeth into.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Playing an evil character is much more fun…</p>\n<p>A: It can be. But I’m glad I don’t play it all the time because it’s nice to go back and forth and play different types of guys.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Was it fun to slap your co-star Miles Teller repeatedly?</p>\n<p>A: It’s great fun to slap Miles Teller, it’s beautiful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s it like to play different characters and not being put in a box?</p>\n<p>A: That’s always the goal; good writing is always a joy to do. Bad writing is hard to act and when you get boxed in doing a stereotypical character, those could be long days in the office.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How does it feel to be nominated for an Oscar from a film that was made in only 20 days?</p>\n<p>A: 19 actually. We’re sort of the little movie that could and for the film to be nominated as a Best Picture nominee, Damien to be nominated and Tom, our sound guy [is incredible].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Damien is only thirty years old, which is pretty young…</p>\n<p>A: He was twenty-six when I first met him, [that’s] when his journey started.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Logan Lerman (“Fury”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: The magnitude of this film — what was it like to work with all these amazing actors?</p>\n<p>A: I felt really lucky to be in good company and they pushed me to play as I’ve ever been before.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did they teach you anything during the process?</p>\n<p>A: They taught me a lot about myself, my personal limits, what it’s like to break those limits and what happens on camera and in scenes. I learned a lot from them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Were there any pranks going on during the filming?</p>\n<p>A: No, it was a pretty serious set. But it was a great experience, it really was.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Should fans anticipate another Percy Jackson?</p>\n<p>A: Not that I’m aware of. I know the fans would really like it and I really want another one. They’re fun films, they are really fun to make, but I haven’t heard anything about that, so I don’t know. I think we all are getting a little old to play those characters, so I wouldn’t hold my breath necessarily.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>David Oyelowo (“Selma”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara, how does it feel to be here?</p>\n<p>A: I love Santa Barbara; I always have a good time every time I come here. It’s nice to come here and get an award.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to prepare for this role, such an iconic character?</p>\n<p>A: It was challenging but it was also incredibly rewarding. The most rewarding thing is to see people respond so beautifully to the film.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I know you recently marched with Oprah this past MLK Day in Selma. How did it feel to march down the town’s incredible history?</p>\n<p>A: It was a full circle for us because Selma still has a lot of problems. [It’s] economically deprived [and] there is still segregation down there, not officially, but practically speaking there is. Hopefully the film brings attention to the community in a way that helps it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman (“Get on Up”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like being a playwright in New York and now getting to play all these iconic characters?</p>\n<p>A: It was two different worlds. As a playwright, it’s just you and your typewriter, it’s you and your character in a room and that it is one of the most exhilarating things you can have when you have a story that is being told to you by your own character. It rivals any moment you can have onstage, moments you can have onscreen when a story is coming through. It’s as exhilarating as being in front of the camera.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I hope that you do come back to theater.</p>\n<p>A: Who says I left theater. Maybe I’ll go to New York and train with a teacher, do some workshops. All that [can] happen, you just haven’t seen it.</p>\n<p>Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How do you feel when people categorize your film as an “abortion romcom?”</p>\n<p>A: Well you are the only person that has said that to me. I would say that when you see the movie, you’ll see that it is a story about one woman in our world right now. [She’s] making appropriate decisions for herself, and finding joy in that, and finding the complexities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I understand maybe why the media would call it an abortion comedy because it seems like a buzzy phrase. [The phrase] doesn’t mean much to me. As you can see from the work we did, our film is beautiful and complex.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/","id":6068,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6067,6066,6065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Emotions Spring Up During Michael Keaton’s Tribute","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Michael Keaton is well-loved.

A man who has done genres from salacious comedy to psycho-thriller, he’s scored admiration from co-stars and directors alike in his career, which began in 1968 when he operated “Picture, Picture” for Mister Rogers. But the fact that Keaton is well-loved was perhaps never as overwhelmingly apparent as it was last Saturday, Jan. 31 during his Maltin Modern Master tribute ceremony for his work in “Birdman.” Between Jeff Bridges’ video message, Danny Devito’s surprise entrance and SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling’s tearful speech, the love was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It started off with a speech from ­­­film critic Leonard Maltin, who moderated the evening. Instead of the proverbial praising of Keaton for all that he has done, Maltin opted for a flashback. “I remember sitting in the theater in Manhattan on Broadway with my wife in 1982 … and watching a movie called ‘Night Shift,’” he said. “Onto the screen burst this extraordinary comedic performer.”</p>\n<p>Maltin continued by focusing not on the Birdman-Batman dichotomy that so many film critics have fallen for, but instead insisting that “Birdman is just a reaffirmation of Michael Keaton’s enormous talent.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Birdman as a reaffirmation of his talent” was a theme that continued throughout the night, a direct response to all the press Keaton is getting for his absence in Hollywood. “Birdman” stars Keaton as a washed-up actor famous for being a superhero, who attempts to restore his craft through theater. So it’s pretty easy to compare Keaton’s own life to that of his character — actor famous for being a superhero disappears until this movie. Perhaps Keaton’s personal life was part of director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s impetus for placing him as Riggan Thomson.</p>\n<p>More likely though is that Keaton’s reputation as a versatile actor contributed to him getting this role, one that has landed him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as a contender for the Oscar. Whatever the reason, the fact that Keaton is a man of many roles was spelled out time and time again during his tribute at the Arlington.</p>\n<p>“Hi Michael, it’s your old friend Noni … I think this [award is] kind of great because it is for your body of work,” said Winona Ryder, in her video message that kicked off “Beetlejuice” clips. She stood in the snow at Sundance, clearly freezing in a hooded coat as she voiced her excitement for Keaton. “The thing about you is that I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people cannot decide what their favorite Michael Keaton movie is … because you create such extraordinary characters.”</p>\n<p>Judging from his expressiveness when talking about his career, it seemed like one of Keaton’s favorites to work on was definitely “Beetlejuice.” The actor lit up while talking about Tim Burton. “Tim. He’s unique,” he said, as the crowd laughed. “It’s not a word you can apply to many people … He had this thing, but he couldn’t quite [describe it yet]. He wasn’t there yet.” Keaton mentioned that he almost didn’t do the movie because the visionary eccentric Burton wasn’t describing anything he could understand.</p>\n<p>But a great thing about working with Burton [apart from directors like, say, Tarantino] was that he did not monopolize his directing status, and allowed Keaton to be part of the creative process. “[Tim told me that] maybe [Betelgeuse] lives under rocks — so I got the idea of mold. That’s where the mold came from.”</p>\n<p>In 1989, Keaton got to work with Burton again for “Batman” and he developed the rough voice that the superhero became so iconic for. He was, in fact, the very first Batman that gave Bruce Wayne a different voice in the suit.</p>\n<p>“I’d move from Bruce Wayne to Batman, [and thought] he had to transcend. I worked out this whole bullshit actor-y thing. I thought, ‘I gotta have something that makes me believe I don’t walk out on the street in this big rubbery suit and people think — hey Bruce Wayne is out again.’ So I did the voice. And we just used it. Every time I was Batman I altered my voice.”</p>\n<p>That bullshit actor-y thing became the basis for Keaton’s Birdman voice. “[For “Birdman”], the voice got crazier, with more incarnations of it. And then it grew from that.”</p>\n<p>The voice is just one of the aesthetic elements of “Birdman,” a drums-steered movie where the camera never stops rolling. “It was a risky gig, for all of us. But what are we here for? We are here for a millisecond,” said Keaton. “For me courage is the ultimate. That’s it. You gotta have guts.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton’s guts were displayed well and true in “Birdman,” but the thing that made this particular evening so special was the enormous affection showered onto him by colleagues. And no video message, not even Robert Duval or Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s, could top the emotion of SBIFF Artistic Director Roger Durling.</p>\n<p>“In 2001, Michael would show up to a coffee shop in Summerland and order a double nonfat latte from a barista,” he began. “[He’d] show up on Sundays to my little café to talk to me about movies … On the red carpet when you just drove in on your limo, you turned to people and said ‘Where is mi amigo Roger’ and it just so shows who you are,” Durling’s voice started cracking.</p>\n<p>“[You’re] not just one of the greatest actors working today, but you’re full of integrity. You are such a real man, an hombre. I feel crystallized that the 12 years I’ve been working at the film festival, it was all meant for me to be able to honor you tonight. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton is well-loved. Yes, indeed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/","id":6036,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6035,6034,6033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award “Theory of Everything” Stars Speak to the Nexus on the Red Carpet","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Eddie Redmayne has been on a roll lately.

That has always been the main focus for all of us, in making the film, to shed light on this phenomenal woman.”</p>\n<p>After the meetings with reporters, and when the photographers finished taking all the red carpet snaps they needed, the procession moved inside the theater for the main event. Roger Durling, executive director of the film festival, gave a short speech and introduced Scott Feinberg, writer for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, who moderated the evening. The Q&amp;A was interspersed with three clips from “The Theory of Everything” as well as clips from past films starring the actors including “Savage Grace,” “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables” for Redmayne, and “The Tempest,” “Like Crazy” and “The Invisible Woman” for Jones.</p>\n<p>Feinberg asked them many questions, starting with if they knew each other before the film. The two had met before, having auditioned for a few of the same films, none of which either of them earned, they joked.</p>\n<p>Meeting Stephen and Jane Wilde Hawking was an honor for the pair, and they described how nervous they would get whenever one of the Hawkings visited the set during production. They also talked about the difficulties of portraying the different stages of Stephen’s ALS, which included Jones acting out the changing methods Jane would use as his disease progressed. This was especially difficult considering that scenes, for budget reasons, are not filmed in chronological order. Luckily, both Stephen and Jane loved the actors’ performances, saying it was like watching themselves.</p>\n<p>Drawing away from “Theory,” the two elaborated on their earlier work. Redmayne described his incredibly awkward but amusing experiences playing Julianne Moore’s son in “Savage Grace<em>,</em>” which is about an incestuous mother-son relationship. While filming “My Week with Marilyn<em>,</em>” he remembered how insensitive he sometimes was about how difficult it was for Michelle Williams to play an icon like Marilyn Monroe. The insensitivity came back to haunt him during his trial and tribulations while acting as Stephen.</p>\n<p>Jones also discussed the interesting experience she had filming “Like Crazy.” The film did not have a formal script, just a very detailed story outline around which the actors improvised all of their dialogue. She said this was a difficult but rewarding experience, and did improvisation again with the same director in “Breathe In.”</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A ended with Feinberg introducing screenwriter McCarten to the stage to present the Cinema Vanguard Award. His moving and funny speech praised the stars for their talent, wit and most of all, their young age. “Their combined age is 35,” he joked. He also thanked them for their extraordinary performances that brought his screenplay to life and gave them their award, ending the beautiful night in downtown Santa Barbara.</p><div

and primary songwriter for Steppenwolf, took the stage on Friday night at SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club before being joined by the night’s main performers, The Dirty Knobs.</p>\n<p>Known for hits such as “Born to Be Wild” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” Steppenwolf achieved worldwide recognition in the late 1960s before breaking up in 1972 and then on-and-off reuniting through the years. Although he often performs with a backing band, John Kay, a Santa Barbara resident, is now the only original member of the group.</p>\n<p>Kay opened the night solo, playing blues songs from his “rambling days” before Steppenwolf. Using his instantly recognizable slide guitar style and switching between acoustic and steel guitars, the musician told stories from his life to provide context for each song. During this set, the general admission audience crowded together near the doorway to see from behind those still eating dinner in front of the stage. SOhO staff also maintained a no-talking policy, but that did not stop some of the more enthusiastic audience members from yelling the occasional “You rock, John Kay!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Any ability to enforce the rule went out the window when The Dirty Knobs walked onstage and joined in midway through “The Pusher,” turning the quiet, but passionate song into a booming, energetic spectacle. Using every inch of space available to them, the crowd danced, shouted and sang along with whatever words they knew. Kay proceeded with “Sookie Sookie” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” ending with a long, aggressive performance of “Born to Be Wild.” He somehow preserved all the roughness and energy of the original recording with some to spare.</p>\n<p>After staff cleared the tables and perfected sound levels, The Dirty Knobs returned sans Kay with their own set list to carry out the night. The Knobs, regulars of SOhO, are generally considered a side project of Mike Campbell, lead guitarist for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. But on Friday, the band was also joined by Ron Blair (who replaced regular bassist Lance “Crawdaddy” Morrison currently on tour with Don Henley) and keyboardist Benmont Tench, both original members of The Heartbreaker.</p>\n<p>On Tench’s inclusion, Campbell said he was eager to play with Kay, but did not realize until after he took the gig that they would need a keyboardist. “You can’t play Steppenwolf without that fucking organ. And there’s only one guy I know up to the challenge,” Campbell said.</p>\n<p>The band performed an eclectic list of cover songs, from Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates’ frequently covered “Shakin’ All Over” to The Kinks’ relatively unknown “Apeman.” Seventy-nine on <em>Rolling Stones’</em> 100 Greatest Guitarists list, Campbell proved that legendary guitarists can afford to be generous, and made a point to give every band member a chance in the spotlight. At one point, he invited the group’s roadie, known simply as Chinner, to play lead guitar on a song.</p>\n<p>In addition to improv solos from Blair and Tench, rhythm guitarist Jason “Ape” Sinay traded lead parts with Campbell, and drummer Matt “Swampfox” Laug played complicated fills, while Campbell frequently directed the crowd’s attention to him as if a proud mother. With the exception of Tench, every band member also sang on at least one song.</p>\n<p>By the end of their set list, the audience was chanting “Dirty Knobs” until the band reemerged for their own rendition of the Jimi-Hendrix-popularized “Hey Joe” with an intro featuring segments of “1983.” Their extended, over-driven and no-holds-barred version of the song put the members’ true skill and cohesion on display. Campbell demonstrated much of the speed, agility and overall guitar mastery of Hendrix, with fewer of the show-off-y riffs.</p>\n<p>As the crowd thinned out, the members walked around the club, speaking with fans and posing for pictures. Laug said the night exceeded his expectations, and that playing with other artists is his favorite aspect of performing live.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was one of the better gigs ever. It was amazing,” he said. “We don’t get that much [interaction between live musicians] these days. Because of the technology, everybody can do everything on the computer by themselves.

But thanks to the groundbreaking filming tools of digital macro and motion macro 3D technology, viewers can now uncover a secret world underneath the waves. We’re talking about a world too small to be seen by the naked eye.</p>\n<p>Shot in the Bahamas, Fiji and Bimini, “Secret Ocean 3D” displays the interdependent relationships of marine life through octopi, Moray eels, arrow crabs and zooplankton spaceships. Over 40 species are observed in the documentary, enabling audience members to get up close and personal to underwater scenes like Squid City and Kelp Forest Avenue. With revolutionary filming techniques, director Jean-Michel Cousteau takes the world on the ultimate dive and shows how even the smallest organisms (on which the rest of the food chain depends) warrant as much protection as the dolphins and whales.</p>\n<p>“Secret Ocean 3D” will be screened downtown on Feb. 2. Jean-Michel Cousteau and his children Fabien and Celine were honored with the Attenborough Award on Jan. 28 at the Arlington Theater. Pick up the <em>Daily Nexus</em> next week for coverage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bD8gnSlZW8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones</p>\n<p>Arasch Blurfrushan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, stars of “The Theory of Everything” will be honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award in recognition of their career achievements, particularly for their acclaimed performances as Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde Hawking.</p>\n<p>Born in London on January 6, 1982, Redmayne started his performance career with the National Youth Music Theatre and made his stage debut at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in 2002. He scored his break with a minor role as Matt Damon’s son in the 2006 film “The Good Shepherd.” His rise continued with major roles in “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables.”</p>\n<p>Jones was born in Birmingham, England on October 17, 1983. The English actress’s first major role was the antagonist in the 1998 British TV series “The Worst Witch.” She went on to appear in “Doctor Who” and in a TV adaptation of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>. In 2011, Jones won the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize for “Like Crazy,” for her role opposite Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence. The actors improvised almost of all of the dialogue from a script outline.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” portrays the personal lives of the Hawkings and how instrumental Jane was in her husband’s success. Jones’s Oscar-nominated and moving performance excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle and her deep love for Stephen that allowed her to stay with him for years. A favorite for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Redmayne’s portrayal of Hawking’s intial stages of ALS was near flawless. Redmayne and Jones will be honored at the Arlington Theater tonight, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Salz7uGp72c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Confession”</p>\n<p>Alex Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Premiering in the United States at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, “Confession” is the debut feature of director Lee Do-Yoon. Nominated for three Korean Golden Bell Awards, the South Korean film is a neo-noir crime thriller that follows three friends: Hyun-tae, In-chul and Min-soo.</p>\n<p>After graduating from school, the three begin to lead separate lives. Hyun-tae and Min-soo take on calm lifestyles with standard jobs, while In-chul’s career as an insurance agent leads him to take some considerably criminal risks. When Hyun-tae’s mother tasks the three with burning down her casino in order to get the insurance money, things get rather complicated. If the film’s trailer is any indication, “Confession” promises to be a twisted, intense film.</p>\n<p>“Confession” will be screened downtown on Jan. 30 through Feb. 1.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JpRDHVlG2zk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Last Five Years”</p>\n<p>Bin Nguyen, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Let’s be honest: were you a fan of “High School Musical” when you were a little kid? Well if you were (or secretly were), you will definitely enjoy this little film, since it is pretty much the adult, real-world version of HSM. Based on the Broadway musical with the same name, “The Last Five Years” is a romantic journey between two young individuals making their way in the city of New York. Struggling actress Cathy Hiatt, (Anna Kendrick, “Pitch Perfect”) and aspiring novelist Jamie Wellerstein (Jeremy Jordan, “Smash”) are a married couple going through the ropes of a modern 21st-century relationship.</p>\n<p>Unlike any other cliché love story, “The Last Five Years” is told in a very different way. Directed by Academy Award nominee Richard LaGravenese, the musical explores the history of the two lovers in opposite chronological order. Cathy’s point of view is told in flashback from the end of the marriage while Jamie’s version is told from the first time the pair met.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t catch spoilers in the last sentence, yes, the marriage did not last. Audiences get to enjoy the songs and music that pair with a slowly destructive relationship, while relating to the issues that every couple has to face.</p>\n<p>The main winner in this situation is the musical’s writer, Jason Robert Brown. While the Broadway musical is based on his own failed marriage to his ex-wife, it is Brown who has the final laugh as he now has written a highly successful play that has been produced internationally. So it must be true … nothing like a heartbreak to develop some real inspiration. Take that Taylor Swift! You’re not the only one making it rain by writing music about your failed relationships!</p>\n<p>“The Last Five Years” will make you laugh, cry, and sing along … maybe all at the same time. It will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 2 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dT0mrKzObw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies”</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60299\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"734258363\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60298\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60299\" data-attachment-id=\"60299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/mv5bmty1ndc4mja5mv5bml5banbnxkftztcwnji5njuwna-_v1_sx214_al_/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"214,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60299 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=214%2C325\" alt=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" width=\"214\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?w=214&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-60299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>imdb.com</em></p></div>\n<p>Follow the steady descent of Gilby Small’s life as he loses his job, his girlfriend and his apartment all in a single week. As a man in his thirties newly re-nesting with his eccentric mother, Gilby doesn’t have much going for him. But when a glimmer of hope appears on the horizon of his increasingly bleak life in the form of Rachel, his best friend’s married sister, Gilby sees no choice but to attempt to woo her … with a string of lies, of course.</p>\n<p>When he finally lies himself into a corner, Gilby realizes he must confront himself before trying to be with anybody else. Written and directed by Phil Allocco, “The Truth About Lies” puts a comically depressing yet endearing twist on the typical romantic comedy. It forces audiences to identify with Gilby, the big liar. What is the truth about lies? Maybe that we all do it to fabricate certain aspects of our lives and ourselves in an attempt to give others a wrong impression. Or maybe that lies can be occasionally well-meaning.</p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies” will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 1 and Feb. 4.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

beach bums, the year-round sunshine and, of course, the unbelievably cheap ticket price to see festival-headlining acts.</p>\n<p>In an altruistic act of maintaining the good name of the Santa Barbara music scene, We The Beat and UCSB DJ Club are bringing out the best and brightest in Trap-style, G-House and NuDisco-Funk. LOUDPVCK, Djemba Djemba, AC Slater and Zimmer will be vibrating chest cavities of hundreds of young people with low frequency bass wobbles and over-looped high hats at the Earl Warren Showgrounds this Saturday, Jan. 31.</p>\n<p>Comprised of trap-style wonder kids Kenny Beats and Ryan Mark, LOUDPVCK has come a long way from the remix-only project that started when they met at Berklee College of Music in 2009. In 2012, they soared up in charts during the explosive popularization of trap music riding the coattails of Baauer, Flosstradamus and RL Grime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the cannabis-enthusiast trap duo proved to be more than another set of EDM flavor-of-the-week DJs. In late 2013, as the ever-fickle electronic music scene left the iconic sound of the dirty south behind in favor of an obnoxious monotony of Big Room House synths, the PVCK remained tried and true to their hip-hop roots.</p>\n<p>While their latest releases feature far more sophisticated layering than early hits like “NV$TY” and “DIP’N IT,” the soul of gangster rap which built their fan base is still brimming in tracks like their A$AP Rocky bootleg. Also, if having a featured set on the radio show “Sway in the Morning” doesn’t certify these guys’s authenticity as hip-hop souls, little else can.</p>\n<p>Also on the bill for Saturday is underdog producer prodigy Djemba Djemba. It’s hard to know what to make of this kid. Andrew Swanson, as his parents know him, is a camera-shy enigma, a rarity in EDM culture where it seems the newest sound is as important as the most fashionable haircut.</p>\n<p>Swanson’s social media is littered with psychedelic paintings of jungle cats and sideways photos of him hunching his shoulders in playfully awkward poses. But don’t let that fool you — this guy is no slouch. He has served as the primary audio engineer for several of the biggest names in the industry, most notably Diplo.</p>\n<p>Swanson is a producer of phenomenal talent whose reach extends beyond his solo project. His name pops on just about everything from track credits on “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” soundtrack to Chris Brown’s latest solo album, <em>X</em>.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with his Boiler Room set will know the DJ disdains being encapsulated by one genre of music. For a prediction of the nature of his set on Saturday, check out his SoundCloud feed. True to his versatile tastes, Swanson’s SoundCloud is comprised almost exclusively of the latest and greatest in electronic music by artists you’ve never heard of.</p>\n<p>Next up, AC Slater of Dim Mak fame needs no grand introduction. He was a pioneer for heavy bass, going one deeper before it was cool. The Tchami signature bass wobbles that now fill main stages across the world owe Slater a kiss on the cheek for paving the way over four years ago.</p>\n<p>But don’t expect fist pumping and jumping during AC Slater. His will be a slower, tempo hip-swaying clubby set, a welcome refresher to counterbalance the headlining act.</p>\n<p>So here’s the bottom line. This show is not for: people who get nervous in crowds, people who say drum machines don’t have a soul and people who don’t like hip hop. This show <em>is</em> for: people who love hip-hop, people who crave the unexpected (Djemba Djemba is one of the most unpredictable live musicians in the industry) and people who realize that <em>usually</em> it’s $30 to see any single one of the four artists on the bill individually.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GjR5lP8kGJo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60318\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/earl-wobble-showgrounds-loudpvck-djemba-djemba-ac-slater-and-zimmer-invade-local-sb-showgrounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60318\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/earl-wobble-showgrounds-loudpvck-djemba-djemba-ac-slater-and-zimmer-invade-local-sb-showgrounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/earl-wobble-showgrounds-loudpvck-djemba-djemba-ac-slater-and-zimmer-invade-local-sb-showgrounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/earl-wobble-showgrounds-loudpvck-djemba-djemba-ac-slater-and-zimmer-invade-local-sb-showgrounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/earl-wobble-showgrounds-loudpvck-djemba-djemba-ac-slater-and-zimmer-invade-local-sb-showgrounds/","id":7731,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7730,7729,7728],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF: “Desert Dancer” Premieres on Opening Night Plus Exclusive Interviews with Star Reece Ritchie and Director Richard Raymond","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Even though Santa Barbara is mostly famous for its beaches and natural landscapes, every year at the end of January the coastal city becomes the place to be for filmmakers and movie lovers.

The Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) is a 12-day celebration of all things cinema. Folks from all around the world travel here to catch the latest premieres and mingle with the hottest celebrities. Notable names this year include Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell. On Jan. 28, SBIFF welcomed its 30th anniversary with the opening premiere of the film “Desert Dancer.”</p>\n<p>Starring “Slumdog Millionaire’s” Freida Pinto, “Downtown Abbey’s” Tom Cullen and “Prince of Persia’s” Reece Ritchie, “Desert Dancer” tells the real-life story of young male dancer named Afshin Ghaffarian , who was born in Iran, a country where dancing is forbidden. Growing to love dancing, Afshin (Ritchie) is taught to resist his artistic abilities at a very young age.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at college, he is quick to discover a group of friends who encourage him to free himself. Having no dance background, Afshin teaches himself the moves through the only safe option he could find, YouTube. After watching countless instructional dancing videos, Afshin teaches his group of friends the basics of modern dance. The group begins rehearsing in secrecy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Then enters Elaheh (Pinto), a beautiful yet troubled classically trained young dancer who becomes Afshin’s ultimate dancer partner. Together, Afshin and Elaheh begin an emotional love story revolving around their passion for dance. Set amidst political turmoil of Iran’s 2009 presidential election, the dancers endure pain, love and separation while continuing to perform their greatest joy.</p>\n<p>However, as Afshin becomes increasingly targeted for his desire to dance, he realizes that the only option to fulfill his dream is to flee to Paris and leave his friends behind. He is liberated from his oppressive state and finds a new home in France, where he is granted political asylum and allowed to accomplished his greatest dream: to dance in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>First-time director Richard Raymond heard of Afshin’s life story in the most unusual way. “I had read it in a newspaper<em>, The Sunday’s Times</em>, a story about a young man Afshin Ghaffarian who wanted to become a dancer. But in Iran, dance was forbidden,” said Raymond in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> on the red carpet. “I couldn’t believe it, I was shocked — I couldn’t believe that something as innocent as dancing could be forbidden.” The young director explained the underlying message of his film, saying, “I believe that art can free anyone from oppression.”</p>\n<p>As the story spread about Afshin, Raymond’s independent film was financed by people who believed in its strong message. “The whole concept of freedom and speech, freedom of expression, it’s very important to have that,” said executive producer Mohammed Al Turki. “It was incredible that this film was only made with four million dollars.” Considering “Desert Dancer’s” star-studded cast and expensive location spots in Morrocco, London and Paris, the film made the most of its menial budget.</p>\n<p>Leading stars Pinto and Ritchie took drastic measures to prepare for their roles. To portray the elegance of a classical dancer, Pinto took rigorous dance training for a year. “The physical challenge was really difficult — blisters, pain, it was really hard,” said Ritchie. “Dancing on sand is nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p>But things started to look up for Ritchie when he re-evaluated his role as Afshin. “You suddenly realize that it’s about the impulse that this person is trying to express, rather than the technical brilliance of the dance,” said Ritchie. “I love that it was different, it was a story about freedom. Instead of car chases and gun fights, it was a human story, [one] that happened only four or five years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” is an emotionally-charged film with an important message: art is freedom. The story of Afshin Ghaffarian serves as a beacon of hope for any young individual who has the desire to achieve their biggest dream.</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” opens in select theaters on April 10.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/","id":6042,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6041,6040,6039],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Patti Smith Plays Explosive Show at the Granada Godmother of Punk Rock Sells Out Arts & Lectures Gig","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting at the edge of the Granada theater stage, the godmother of punk rock shook her silver hair out before jumping down, landing with a feathery thud into the thin carpet.

A collective gasp came from 272 audience members sitting in the front section who held their breath as she moved past them, dancing and clapping for her band onstage. Humble as ever, she tried to make herself a member of the crowd, giving her beloved guitarist of over 25 years Lenny Kaye time to shine. But it didn’t work. All eyes were on the otherworldly woman roaming through the aisles: Patti Smith.</p>\n<p>Sexy, expressive and constantly in motion, Smith and her band played a 15-song set as part of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures winter season. Wearing jeans that bagged around the knees and her signature menswear blazer, Smith bent gender roles through her feisty cool girl stage presence. Described by the late rock critic Lester Bangs in 1976 as a “badass who pulls off the feat of being simultaneously idol of women and lust object of men,” the 68-year-old rocker continued to bring the badassery.</p>\n<p>In between verses of “Ain’t It Strange,” she sprayed saliva over her right shoulder, nearly hitting her bassist, Tony Shanahan, standing four feet away. During the heavier songs, Smith prowled around the stage like an animal, letting Kaye’s explosive guitar riffs pulsate throughout her body. At one point there was so much fierce tension onstage between singer and guitarist that a fire seemed to erupt from their knees, as they kept bending back and forth towards each other in a frenzy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At other times, Smith displayed a feminine flirtiness. During “Pumping (My Heart),” she climbed towards the drum kit, playfully waving her body in front of drummer of 40 years Jay Dee Daugherty. Her dancing ranged from the feistiness of an angsty teenage boy to the slow, fleshy movements of a woman seducing her lover. “She danced as if she was a 50s back up dancer with an up-do and a miniskirt, and it honestly made me want to take my clothes off,” said fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who paused a second before adding, “I think I’m in love with a woman.”</p>\n<p>While she undoubtedly had enormous sex appeal, Smith also exuded a mother-like warmth throughout the venue. Gracious and humble, she never tried to out-do her band. Instead, she showed support and love, visibly encouraging them to jam harder and slipping into the audience and the side of the stage to observe the whole scene.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just the band that felt the warmth; the whole of Granada felt the golden honey cover their bodies and melt away the stresses of tomorrow. Her love for her fans was evident when she trotted through the aisles, holding hands of people who reached for her and receiving hugs and kisses with a smile.</p>\n<p>Linda Benet, a faculty member of SBCC, saw Smith at festivals in the mid-70s, but Tuesday’s show was the first time she saw the rocker perform on a solo bill. “Patti is someone many, many of us seem to trust to take into our psyches perhaps ’cause of her honesty and rawness combined with love,” Benet said.</p>\n<p>This idea of trust resonates especially with those who work closely with Smith. “Her love goes to all people, all people around the world [who] she helps. Patti never had enough food when she was growing up, she never had a toy … she slept in streets. These experiences made her warm,” said Yuki Burns, Smith’s personal assistant, in a conversation after the show. A peppy Japanese lady, Burns has worked with Smith for over 15 years, and handed out prized set lists in Smith’s handwriting to anyone who wanted it.</p>\n<p>Another thing about the lady rocker is that she’s got no shortage of wit. During an improvised rendition of “My Blakean Year,” she stopped the poetry on a line about Ethel Barrymore to rant about John Barrymore being a black sheep and how humans give pigs a bad name. A natural performer, she maintained a lively conversation with the audience throughout the entire show. “Wing!” a man in row Y shouted, referencing a song from <em>Gone Again</em>. “Oh we’re not doing that one,” she answered, but then went into a cappella on the chorus. It was rough around the edges, but her spirit was there and claps ensued afterward. “Sang a little flat, but it was for him, so,” she winked towards the back row.</p>\n<p>Songs were sung in memory of Amy Winehouse, Monty Brown and Fred “Sonic” Smith, the last of whom is her late husband. “I wrote the words of this song for my boyfriend in 1978 … He became my husband, the father of my children and though he is departed, we think of him always. When I sing the words of this song, it is as if it were the first time,” she said, slowing her voice to annunciate “first” and “time” as separate units. “Because the Night” followed this sweet introduction.</p>\n<p>A second tender moment came when she told the story of how The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun” was the first song she hit all the notes to when she was 16. “Eric Burdon and the Animals … were for us, they were for the disenfranchised, the mavericks, the black sheep, maybe they were for John Barrymore. I say this because tonight we all got to meet Eric and I didn’t get to express this little story to him … I am singing today because I hit all the notes.”</p>\n<p>But the best part of the night came when Smith began the poetry of “Gandhi.” Pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose and reading off two sheets of paper stapled together, she started off slow, so slow one could’ve been lulled to sleep.</p>\n<p>Then came the thunder, the firepower that gets unleashed when Smith gets in the groove. Over the course of eight minutes, she threw the paper down, shoved her glasses into the blazer, spat over her shoulder three times and knocked over the mic stand twice. The song pulled and pulsed, the build moving gradually until all of Granada was about to explode with a carnal euphoria.</p>\n<p>In a moment that went unnoticed by the frontwoman, a man sitting in row P behind a couple sharing binoculars smiled to himself. “Nobody does a build like Patti Smith,” he announced out loud. “Nobody.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

across America, the city south of Los Angeles comes alive once again on the stereo with Vince Staples’ new EP, <em>Hell Can Wait</em>. Staples is an artist with a street cred as long as his list of collaborations with artists like Odd Future and Mac Miller. In his new album, the seasoned rapper tells a disarmingly honest and uncomfortably up-front story that takes the listener by the hand through the streets of Long Beach. Never overwhelmingly edgy nor depressingly pessimistic, <em>Hell Can Wait </em>has Staples echoing “Hope I outlive them red roses,” a lyrical sign of the artist’s morning star peeking over the proverbial Long Beach horizon.</p>\n<p>Though the album is only half an hour long, don’t mistake brevity for lack of depth and versatility. The rapper offers his thoughts on everything from gangbanging to police brutality from his own experiences in a coherent, rational fashion. Never hurried, the lyrics come from a deeply rooted place that he offers as soul food to his audience.</p>\n<p>In “65 Hunnid,” Staples reflects on his days gangbanging, reminiscing “You alone / Car full of n*ggas but you alone / It’s time to show how much you love your homies.” Juxtaposing sex and gangbanging, Staples shows that his story isn’t the typical, “get money mo’ money” stories saturating the gangster rap industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rather, his tales are told in the “still-life” moments of hustling, the day-to-day moments of living on the streets. In a recent interview with <em>Pitchfork</em>, Staples compares music to being “in the zoo, and the listeners are the people outside of the cage … you’re not going to step inside that glass, because you know what’ll happen to you. [But] Rappers are making this shit a petting zoo.” Whether that’s a verdict on the rap industry as a whole or Staples offering his thoughts on his song-writing process is up for interpretation.</p>\n<p>A lack of glorification of gang culture is a defining aspect of <em>Hell Can Wait</em>. Staples’ constant themes about the Dickensian aspect of the street-life, from selling drugs to riding with his homies, solidifies his credo as one of the most genuine rappers today. In “Screen Door,” he explores his past living with his drug-dealing father and working-class mother, ranting, “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG / this ain’t no movie, bro.” Laid over an unobtrusive beat and instrumental, Staples chants, “Who’s that peekin’ in my screen door” in between verses of his father’s evolution from drug-dealing to more criminal activities. In a previous mixtape, Staples meditates on his father’s crime, rapping, “Dad did time ‘cause he sold drugs for me / I could never judge a man trying to better off his fam.” Though weak on raw emotion, “Screen Door” is prototypical of the whole album, touching on everything from his mother’s teenage pregnancy, his father’s drug fiasco and his own burning passion for money and respect on the streets.</p>\n<p>And, what’s a ghetto gospel going to be without mention of the police? In “Hands Up,” Staples’ ire against the police and school district comes alive, as he rants, “LAPD, they ain’t ‘bout shit.” His lyrics takes on a caustic quality. Criticizing the police’s use of excessive force, Staples’ lyrics are reminiscent of recent events in Ferguson and reference America’s failed war on crime. Echoing fellow artist Run the Jewels, Staples sardonically reflects, “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around.” According to Staples, Orwellian state oppression has held him down long enough and his lyrics burst with that tension.</p>\n<p>Staples’ future is undoubtedly going to be full of success. Judging from his prolific nature in the past two years, fans probably won’t have to wait too long for another taste. <em>Hell Can Wait </em>is only a freshman EP and Staples is no doubt working on his next album, a prospect that both excites and terrifies this reviewer. Staples’ development over the years shows that his mentors have taught him many useful technical tricks that will prove critically important as he gains more attention in the hip hop community. He has already achieved much by signing on to Def Jam Records. Now all he needs to do is prove that he earned it, a definite struggle in the works.</p>\n<p>Hip hop has always been a trinity between dance, rap and graffiti, the whole being greater than the sum of all three. It has also always been an identity of the oppressed, of the powerless. But as hip hop became more mainstream over the last decade, the community has been more and more marginalized.</p>\n<p>One instance of this was <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s suggestion that the much-maligned rapper Iggy Azalea ‘ran hip hop,’ which drew much criticism of readers and forced the magazine to alter the title of the article. And, even though <em>Forbes</em> is a business magazine that has no relevance in music reporting, the response is symptomatic of a larger disconnect between the mainstream, deridingly-labeled “sell-outs” and their moderate hip hop fans, and the less-well-known underground rappers and their hardcore hip hop fans.</p>\n<p>As Vince Staples walks across the tightrope of success, he must listen to both these groups and his instincts as an artist. There isn’t a <em>Dummy’s Guide to Success as a Hip Hop Artist</em>. He needs to stay relevant in an industry ruled by dance music. But he also needs to stay genuine and true to his art. Whatever he’s going to choose, only time will tell. But, as for right now, <em>Hell Can Wait</em> is a true hip hop album, a fine anthology of life on the streets by a man who lived on the streets.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJLfCBBcZAo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/hell-can-wait-by-vince-staples-taking-a-peek-through-the-screen-door-of-life-in-long-beach/","id":7732,"author":{"id":753,"name":"Jon Choi"},"related":[7731,7730,7729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper and Comes Back to Tell Us What It’s Taught Him","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/81ccb02b.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/81ccb02b.jpeg?resize=648%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Through his extensive solo work and his group Animal Collective, Noah Lennox, AKA Panda Bear, has already established himself in the music world.

As an artist he has nothing to prove anymore, and in creating his fifth full-length solo album, <em>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, </em>he is seemingly able to fully channel this into releasing a product completely reminiscent of his own style and tastes—not that he’s ever really felt the need to conform in his music—and it shows.</p>\n<p><em>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper </em>plays like an ongoing mental trip, the thirteen individual songs play together fluidly yet the album changes and shifts its style slightly with each song’s individual energy. Still the whole thing maintains a consistent feel brought on by distorted unintelligible vocals that somehow come together to create a warped psychedelic dream sequence.</p>\n<p>“Sequential Circuits” opens the record, inciting curiosity and luring the listener in for more with its foreboding seductiveness. The next song, “Mr. Noah” may be the most unique as well as catchy on the album. It begins with a slow build and a dog’s distant whining before infusing a drum and beat. It’s easy to lose oneself in the song, especially since the words come off as mostly syncopated vowel sounds. Still, it’s hard not to try to emulate them with your own strange sounds and break into expressive dance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Another definite high point on the album is reached by the fourth song, “Crosswords.” This song almost evokes a feeling of nostalgia from an unknown memory. If there were a memory associated with this song though, it would be drunkenly slow dancing in a tropical beachside nightclub as Lennox repeats “you got it good, so good…” This continues with a steadier, faster more rhythmic beat in “Butcher Baker Candlestick Maker” and the slow tropical psychedelic vibe is again revisited in “Come To Your Senses” later in the album.</p>\n<p>As far as lyrics and song meanings go, “Boys Latin” may be the most hopeful to try and read, and that’s with the help of an exceptionally abstract music video. Words like “Beasts don’t have a second to think// But we don’t appreciate our things// Dark Cloud descended again” probably references the simplicity of the survival focused “beast” mentality, compared with that of “we” humans who are constantly conscious and ruminating. This coupled with the beautifully trippy video that depicts a man engaging with nature and blurring this binary by slowly morphing into nature-beast nonhuman figure form a mild spiritual enlightenment.</p>\n<p>By the eighth song “Tropic of Cancer” it is almost although a second chapter of the album has begun. Like it has broken through the funky chaos of the first half and resurfaced into a mellow serene Eden. “Lonely Wanderer” officially welcomes the listener to this new land, allowing them to drift away into a childlike state of wondering, or wandering. This new land is fully manifested in “Principe Real” whose underlying marching chant almost seems like a nod to MGMT’s early album <em>Oracular Spectacular. </em></p>\n<p>The album unfortunately must end and does so with “Acid Wash,” which would have been an appropriate name for the entire record. The song sings almost like a congratulatory finale, for what remains unknown. Perhaps for completing the introspective journey the album takes you, and coming out more sensitive and perceptive in its wake. This doesn’t seem too unlikely with lyrics like “You’ve won against the deep// Laugh, the chasm.”</p>\n<p>Although the album’s lyrics are relatively hard to decipher and highly abstract, there is obviously deep relatable meaning left to be interpreted by the listener. To further digest the album looking up the lyrics is highly suggested and almost allows listeners to listen again for the first time with new knowledge and perspective.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/prBaZzYmQrI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-and-comes-back-to-tell-us-what-its-taught-him/","id":7729,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[7728,7727,7726],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain Delights Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ukulele-Orchestra-Image.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ukulele-Orchestra-Image.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  Back for a second performance, The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain dazzled the Campbell Hall stage on Jan. 20 as part of the UCSB Arts & Lectures winter season.

The origins of this orchestra are interesting. Tired of the conventions of the music business, the founders created the group in 1985 based on the strange idea of an orchestra consisting of ukuleles of different sizes. Thirty years later, this strange idea is what makes The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain a continued success. Their ability to charm crowds with their humor, musicality and versatile song choice on the ukulele separates the orchestra from other performing groups.</p>\n<p>Not new to the music scene, The Ukulele Orchestra has previously released albums and DVDs with their own label, as well as with CBS, Sony, Longman, Volume and the Ministry of Sound. In addition to covering popular songs of various genres, the orchestra’s original compositions have been featured in TV, plays, commercials and film including silent films for the British Film Institute. The orchestra has also been invited by classical music channel BBC Radio 3 many times to play live on-air, as well as BBC Radio 1, the rock music channel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On Tuesday night, the orchestra attracted and entertained the crowd at Campbell with lively music and a pleasant sense of humor. Though the crowd was comprised of mostly older, middle-aged men and women, UCSB students piled into the seats.</p>\n<p>“You’re watching the best ukulele orchestra in the nation!” ukulele player Dave Suich said as an introduction. “That’s because we’re the only one the nation!” Surprisingly, they are actually not the only ukulele orchestra in the world. They are, however, the very first one that inspired the birth of a dozen new orchestras.</p>\n<p>The orchestra played original songs and covered wide selections of music, from country singer Dolly Parton’s “Joshua” to French classical composer Camille Saint-Saëns’ “Danse Macabre.” Though the performance consisted of eight members playing in unison, each member performed with his/her own distinct character. Some sang solos, displaying a versatility between the plucking and vocals.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me if I sound like Jimi Hendrix on Quaaludes,” joked soloist George Hinchliffe as he covered English rock band Blur’s “Song 2.”</p>\n<p>Different types of ukuleles were featured, including soprano, concert, baritone, tenor and even bass. The variety of ukes allowed the players to play simple and virtuosic tunes in both high and low registers. After many ’70s song covers, the orchestra gave a rendition of Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.” More upbeat songs followed, and a re-energized crowd erupted in syncopated claps.</p>\n<p>“We only have time for one more song,” Leisa Rea said, to which the audience sighed in unison. “Yeah, sorry. We’re going to have to play it,” she teased.</p>\n<p>Overall, an enjoyable night filled with tuneful plucking and clapping was had by all. Created to be entertaining and strange, The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain do not take themselves too seriously. But that is not to say that listeners don’t take them seriously. Whether they are playing popular tunes, complicated chords or just a simple melody, every talented member of the orchestra creates beauty and amusement in a special way that deserves notice for decades to come. If you ever thought the ukulele was a limited instrument, you would have been proven wrong that night at Campbell Hall by The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

muted my friend’s voice before it came through the other end of the telephone, “Yeah man Mångo Mångo just came on! You don’t want to miss these guys get over here quick!” I rushed through the courtyard, was stamped by the bouncers and slid to the front of the crowd only to be engulfed by vibed-out synths and the highflying vocals of Anna Kasper.</p>\n<p>The party was in full form and its celebratory intentions were clear. The audience donned polka-dotted party hats and the floor was littered with multicolored balloons in accordance with the birthday party album artwork of Ghost Tiger’s new EP, <em>Some Friends Feel Like Family</em>.</p>\n<p>Kasper’s vocals continued to hover over the warm synths and cut through the buttery beats with a clean edge. The combination of sweet disco grooves and Kasper’s drop-dead gorgeous looks was the epitome of sensory overload. Her melody lines sent chills up the spine like Lana del Rey, but without the dreary rainy-day feeling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I wiped a dumbfounded look off my face, shook the thoughts of making her my wife out of my head and resolved to dance like a chilled-out, tobacco-rolling hipster. Mångo Mångo had set the tone for this concert at SOhO, centered on the soulful stylized music from heartbreaking frontwomen and their wailing bands.</p>\n<p>Next came the Blues and Greys, another hand-picked opener and local band with a stunning leading lady, Lindsey Ann. Their indie pop sound was reminiscent of The Killers and The Temper Trap, highlighting heavy rolling bass licks, fast high hats and popping snares that held down wandering guitar licks and Ann’s smooth vocals. Both openers were featured at the New Noise Festival last year and surely have a promising future of creation ahead of them.</p>\n<p>Before Ghost Tiger took the stage, we stepped onto the rooftop to get some air, away from the now-brimming club. Outside, drunk foreigners hopped over the gate and tried to bribe security guards for entry into the sold-out show. Wearing thick Russian accents, they begged “Please! Please! We will pay whatever you want!”</p>\n<p>The security guard calmly and sternly pushed them back behind the gate, simply shaking his head. Although, the scene was slightly pathetic, it was a definite validation that SOhO was the spot for seeing the best music in Santa Barbara on this night.</p>\n<p>Back inside, the crowd was packed tightly together to get up-close and personal with the phantom animal, Ghost Tiger. Alixandra Macmillan-Fiedel, the lead vocalist, stood behind a keyboard with a cherry red, semi-hollow body Gretsch guitar that matched her lipstick. Her eyes and pursed lips sparkled as the rest of the band got set. Christopher Norlinger, lead guitarist, strapped up a black Fender Jaguar that crunched out of a tweed Bogner combo, while bass player Kevin Evans was saddled with a metallic gold Les Paul bass. With Emma Huston on keyboard and backup vocals and Chris Stansell crushing the drums, the band was complete and ready to show off their new tunes.</p>\n<p>All of the songs were musically articulate and intriguing in different ways. Some tracks felt as if you were in your mother’s kitchen, while others conjured up memories of heartbreak or the feeling of wandering through a dark, enchanting forest. Towards the end of the set an ominous bang from Stansell’s floor tom reached down into the pits of the audience’s stomachs as an older man whispered to his wife, “I love this song.”</p>\n<p>The song he was referencing was “Whiskey Winter,” which Macmillan-Fiedel described in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> as a chanting song.</p>\n<p>“I wrote (Whiskey Winter) about four years ago … I was walking around the house with this little drum, kind of in solitude going a little crazy with that beat, because you know it’s sort of chanting … it was one of those songs that kind of just came to me and then I took it to the band and we developed it, of course,” Macmillan-Fiedel said.</p>\n<p>Ghost Tiger ended their set with their catchy and captivating new single, “Science Camp.” Spiking the listener’s interest from the beginning with three loud handclaps, the song reels one in with a pulsing guitar chord. Lyrically, “Science Camp” follows the modern love story of royally fucking up and then begging for your lover back. The lyrics are barebones and take the listener for ride with a wonderful building bridge towards the end.</p>\n<p>Ghost Tiger’s EP release party was a supreme success. Ghost Tiger will be on tour for the next few months, so if you missed them at SOhO check out their tour dates on their website or their Facebook page, and of course watch out for Mångo Mångo and Blues and Greys to be blowing up the local scene.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\"

whiskey sours while a crowd of Gauchos dance their faces off to “I don’t give a f*ck,” the latest ramble of sophistication from Big Sean to bless this college campus. No, this didn’t actually happen, but who knows what the very near future will hold — because it just so happens that Aniston, Carell and Redmayne will be hanging out on State Street, coming to claim their awards as victors in the 2015 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>SBIFF is the 12 days out of the year when State Street is inundated with movie stars and paparazzi, when the red carpet rolls out in front of the Arlington Theater and limousines arrive in hordes like freshmen at a fraternity party. Never-before-seen films debut at one of the seven theaters downtown, with categories including shorts, features, documentaries and the delectably titled “screen cuisine.”</p>\n<p>Post-screening galas are accompanied by Santa Ynez Valley wine, and directors from all over the world swap stories with each other (and lucky Artsweek reporters). Competitions abound, with films from the eastern bloc, Spanish/Latin America and social justice realms going head-to-head for the win. Writers, producers and women from all stages of film production hold panel discussions for aspiring actors and anyone who happens to walk in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2015 marks applause-worthy celebrity award ceremonies for SBIFF, with Michael Keaton (“Birdman”), Logan Lerman (“Fury”), Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”) and Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”) all in attendance.

Lin is an antisocial nerd. Yeh carries a tough-guy facade. The three teens have nothing in common until the death of fellow student Hsia Wei-chiao provides a chance encounter for the boys to meet. Though it is ruled a suicide, the boys’ nagging suspicion propels them to embark on a mission to uncover the true cause of her death.</p>\n<p>As lies are told and secrets are revealed, the Taiwanese film “Partners in Crime” exposes what it means to be a teenager: students are more than just typical high school archetypes, restlessness and loneliness dominate youthful crises. The film also delves into the impact that one-word responses from adults who don’t understand can have. In this compelling mystery thriller, director Chang Jung-chi brings to light the truths of a girl’s death and the reality of the teenage character.</p>\n<p>“Partners in Crime” will be screened on Jan. 28, Feb. 1 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FNbN6dSENA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>When you spend 12 years of your life making one film, you’re going to get some kind of award. It’s just a fact of life.</p>\n<p>Although they actually didn’t work on Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” for <em>that </em>long (just a few weeks every year), Patricia Arquette and regular Linklater-collaborator Ethan Hawke are rightfully receiving the American Riviera Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The two portray the parents of protagonist Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane). Each parent is layered and unique in their own ways. Arquette portrays Olivia Evans, a woman who manages to raise two children and become a professor despite being a single mother and enduring a slew of doomed marriages, one of which was abusive.</p>\n<p>Hawke’s turn as Mason Evans Sr. is equally powerful. He’s fun, holds strong beliefs and occasionally shows some irresponsibility, but like Olivia, his love for his children never wavers. The two actors’ portrayals are both subtle and powerful, never screaming “love me!”, but allowing the audience to see them for who they are: two people. In “Boyhood,” you don’t see Hawke and Arquette playing roles, you see Olivia and Mason Evans, separated parents who grow up just as much as their kids.</p>\n<p>For their fantastic performances, the two will be the first pair of actors to jointly receive the American Riviera Award at the Arlington Theater on State Street on Feb. 5.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0oX0xiwOv8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars”</p>\n<p>Bin Nguyen, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is a dark, fantasy-reality-themed, satirical look on the sexy, yet dangerous world of Hollywood. Starring Academy Award Nominee Julianne Moore and “Twilight” vampire Robert Pattinson, the film focuses on the turbulent, crazy life of a Hollywood actress (Moore) and her personal chauffeur (Pattinson). Her psychotic assistant, played by Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” star Mia Wasikowska, may or may not have a troubling obsession with Moore.</p>\n<p>Using Hollywood as its personal backdrop, “Maps to the Stars” entails all the elements that a good movie needs — drama, sex and suspense. Known in the horror movie genre, director David Cronenberg often incorporates themes of personal transformation in the physicality and emotional aspects of his characters. The movie appears to have all those key qualities; good characters aren’t always good and bad characters aren’t always bad.</p>\n<p>Judging from the film’s trailer, “Maps to the Stars” is a nonstop ride of events that could result in cringe-worthy moments for the audience. While one must need to see the film to appreciate its entire glory, its most notable award being Moore’s Best Actress win at the glamorous Cannes Film Festival in France. “Map to the Stars” is finally making its debut at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and Artsweek suggests you watch it to observe the nonexistence of the famous red mane on Moore’s head, if for nothing else. Yep. Iconic ginger Julianne Moore has turned blonde.</p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is showing Feb. 5-7.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIpD7V4cG9c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer </em></p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston skyrocketed to fame during her time as Rachel Green on “Friends”<em>,</em> when her great hair and bubbly personality stole the nation’s (and world’s) heart. Since then she’s managed to maintain her superstar status through great hair and playing the lead in countless romantic comedies. That isn’t to say Aniston has limited talent — her growing repertoire alone proves she’s a great actress.</p>\n<p>That being said, the seasoned star is now ready to showcase her skill in a new type of role. In Daniel Barnz’s “Cake<em>,</em>” released in late 2014, she stars alongside Anna Kendrick and William H. Macy as a dressed-down and gritty version of herself, a costume she’s never worn before. Aside from the physical difference, this film allows Aniston to portray a character dealing with emotional and physical health issues within a darker plot.</p>\n<p>“Cake” follows Aniston as she becomes obsessed with the suicide of a woman in her support group, while simultaneously dealing with her own deep conflicts. The movie promises to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey, and it will undeniably be interesting to watch the beloved actress transfer her gifts to a different type of film.</p>\n<p>Aniston will be honored with the Montecito Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Jan. 30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3IsUOSHlnU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Wet Bum”</p>\n<p>Jane Huson, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>First-time feature filmmaker Lindsay MacKay masterfully portrays the troubling teenage years of 14-year-old Sam (Julia Sarah Stone) in “Wet Bum.” Not yet physically matured into a “full woman,” Sam is mercilessly mocked for her physical attributes, or lack thereof, by her peers. Ignored and cast aside at school, Sam is forced by her mother to work at the senior assisted living home she manages. There she develops relationships with two residents in particular – Judith (Diana Leblanc), a silent woman who gives attention exclusively to Sam and Ed (Kenneth Welsh), a curmudgeon who often attempts to escape to mysterious places.</p>\n<p>As she grows closer to these disgruntled old-timers, Sam experiences hardship and enlightenment far beyond her years. “Wet Bum” features all the fears and follies you would expect from a coming-of-age story with a wise authenticity that can only be attributed to its youthful director and star. “Wet Bum” will be screened on Jan. 28-30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8Rq78ZJfMo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Steve Carell</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>He has been the 40-Year-Old Virgin, Michael Scott, Maxwell Smart, Brick Tamland, Evan Almighty and Burt Wonderstone. All of these roles have been intended to make audiences laugh, but in “Foxcatcher,” Steve Carell defied expectations and completely immersed himself in the role of John du Pont, a real-life wrestling enthusiast whose unsatisfactory life and touch with insanity destroyed his own life and the lives of others as well. For this metamorphic, shocking and career-defining performance, Carell will receive the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>In “Foxcatcher,” Carell is nigh-unrecognizable as du Pont. The manic, smiling, loud energy with which he utilized in his more famous roles, such as in “The Office” and “Anchorman” are gone. In their stead is a somber, downplayed personality, feelings ranging from torn sadness to brimming rage and noticeable mouth breathing, all coming together to recreate a man who emanates a sense of perverse uneasiness. Carell’s performance clearly portrays a very disturbed man and he does it so extremely well that all other actors in the film (including Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) pale in comparison.</p>\n<p>Carell will be awarded the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award in a Tribute celebration at the Arlington on Feb. 6.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8361stZ8n0w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/","id":6034,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6033,6032,6031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jazz Singer Gregory Porter Charmed Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Campbell Hall buzzed with energy as a crowd waited for jazz singer Gregory Porter to take the stage.

Porter has generated an increasing amount of buzz lately; his 2014 Grammy win for Best Jazz Vocal Album only the latest in a stream of high recognition for his work. Given the singer’s reputation and the fact that he does not often play on the West Coast, this special performance brought by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures met a thrilled audience.</p>\n<p>The stage lights went up on Porter’s band: pianist Chip Crawford, bassist Aaron James, drummer Emanuel Harrold and saxophonist Yosuke Sato all looked suave in neutral-toned suits as they played up-tempo jazz. Applause erupted when Porter strode coolly onstage and took the mic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The California native’s rich baritone voice poured forth like honey whiskey, his tone and delivery intoxicating. He wore a grey jacket over a light green vest along with his signature black cap. After a few bluesy verses, Sato took off on a lofty solo that immediately established his impressive sax chops. Crawford followed with a classical-inspired piano solo. The crowd whooped and cheered as the song climaxed into Porter’s passionate vocals.</p>\n<p>After proper band introductions, a riotous bebop tune discharged. Sato and Crawford delivered rollicking solos that had audience members calling out in delight. A man in the back far right of the audience shouted comments like “yeah, sing it!”</p>\n<p>“For this next one, I’m gonna ask you guys to sing along, kinda like that guy is already doing,” Porter joked. “Yeah I see you man, I see you.” Back Right Guy proceeded to sing a very audible harmony atop the call-and-response chorus of the next song. But it didn’t come off as rude. Rather, adding one’s voice in this way seemed to be encouraged.</p>\n<p>Porter then got the audience clapping enthusiastically to the grooving beat of “Liquid Spirit,” the title track from his latest album. Others in the crowd started calling out with emotion during particularly powerful moments. The fourth wall receded more and more as the night went on.</p>\n<p>A highlight of the show came when Porter sang two slow blues verses a cappella. His superb voice and affecting delivery sent shivers down the spine. Suddenly his lyrics melted into a drumroll and the transition filled the room with anticipatory energy.  Harrold then broke into the best drum solo this reporter has ever seen, at once primal and modern, and extremely satisfying.</p>\n<p>The whole band exuded passion and control in their playing. Emotive facial expressions accompanied impressive feats of musical skill. Throughout the performance, sophistication commingled with rousing music and audience participation, two qualities that do not generally lend themselves to a refined atmosphere.</p>\n<p>One self-described former “jazz head” in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, said the show was quite different than the ones he used to see. He mentioned that he had expected a bit more “coherent behavior” from the band, referring to the abundant amount of soloing. He was impressed with the skill of all the performers despite this, particularly Porter and Sato.</p>\n<p>“Peace and love y’all, thanks so much,” Porter said before strolling offstage with a wave and a smile. The audience applauded wildly and gave him a standing ovation as the band continued to play. After a few minutes, he came back and performed several more songs. When he strode off for a second time, the audience rose again in another standing ovation, this time clapping to the beat. The show ended with a satisfying bass solo from James.</p>\n<p>Gregory Porter and his band delivered an exceptional performance last Thursday. It was everything one hopes a concert will be; moving and entertaining with the occasional spine-chill. In this reporter’s humble opinion, the hype about Gregory Porter is well-deserved.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/","id":7724,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7723,7722,7721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2015 Golden Globes: An evening full of laughter, winners and a surprising F-Bomb.","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"19.3 million people watched the 72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards this past Sunday, kicking off awards season with a bang of surprises.

From the shenanigans of Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, to the surprising victors and their tearful speeches, the Globes kept viewers engaged throughout.</p>\n<p>Poehler and Fey hosted for the third time since their first hosting in 2013, and also announced that this would be their last time as the Golden duo. The funny ladies wasted no time in poking fun at the star-studded audience. Despite the ongoing North Korea Sony hackers gag and a cringe-worthy poke at the Bill Cosby scandal, the comedians mostly kept it lighthearted.</p>\n<p>The best joke of the night was Fey’s jab at George Clooney for receiving an award while his wife received nothing for her work as an activist. “George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin this year,” Fey began. “Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an advisor to Kofi Annan regarding Syria and was selected for a three-person U.N. commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Another comedic highlight came from the viewers themselves. The rise of meme generators made Chrissy Teigen’s crying face an instant source of laughs for many when the model’s husband, John Legend, won a Globe for Best Original Song “Glory” from the film “Selma.”</p>\n<p>The big winners of the evening were “Boyhood” for Best Motion Picture, Drama and “The Grand Budapest Hotel” for Best Picture, Musical or Comedy. The latter was a surprise as many thought “Birdman” would take the Globe home. Richard Linklater took home the Globe for Best Director for his film “Boyhood.”</p>\n<p>Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama went to Eddie Redmayne for his outstanding performance as Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything” and Julianne Moore for “Still Alice” in the actress category. For the Comedy/Musical category, Amy Adams won for the second year in a row, (she took the Globe for “American Hustle” in 2014) with “Big Eyes,” and Michael Keaton beat out fellow actors in the same category for his standout performance in “Birdman,” which tells the story of a washed-up actor who stars in a Broadway play to jumpstart his failing career.</p>\n<p>The acceptance speeches had a common theme of overwhelming emotion and genuine shock. Keaton gave a heartfelt speech, calling his son his “very best friend.” Star of “Jane the Virgin” Gina Rodriguez won Best Actress in a TV Series, landing the CW Network with their first Golden Globe winner. The 30-year-old’s speech left many reaching for the tissue box.</p>\n<p>“My dad used to tell me to wake up and say ‘I can and I will,’” a teary Rodriguez said. “Well, Dad, today is a great day. I can and I did!”</p>\n<p>Kevin Spacey delivered the bleeped-out F-bomb heard throughout the Beverly Hilton when he won best actor for his role as power-hungry Frank Underwood in the Netflix series “House of Cards.” As his first win after being nominated eight times, that F-bomb was more than justified.</p>\n<p>Shocking wins filtered throughout the night. New television shows with terrible soap opera names such as “The Affair” and “Transparent” swept the best actress and actor categories and left puzzled faces asking, “What channel are these shows even on?” (FYI: “The Affair” is on Showtime and “Transparent” streams on Amazon.)</p>\n<p>While the Golden Globes may not be as thrilling as the Emmys or as popular as the Oscars, the show does its job. As the kickoff to awards season, the Globes gives a solid excuse to put on PJ’s, drink wine, eat some fancy cheese and watch the stars we admire be rewarded for bringing their characters to life.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-17/2015-golden-globes-an-evening-full-of-laughter-winners-and-a-surprising-f-bomb/","id":6003,"author":{"id":744,"name":"Brianna Guzman"},"related":[6002,6001,6000],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":47,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
