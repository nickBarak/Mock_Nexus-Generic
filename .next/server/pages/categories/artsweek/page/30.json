Fans prepared themselves for what they thought might be the end of a beautiful era as well as a band they had come to not only know, but grow with. Various theories rose out of this act of disappearance, but most souls were put at ease when the band account, along with its members, resurfaced in a new color based on an entirely new mindset. The 1975 is the band that was able to pull off this reincarnation and emerge in a new light that no one ever saw coming.</p>\n<p>When people first heard The 1975, they envisioned a typical boyband surrounded by hormonal teenage girls in pursuit of a love that may never be. Admittedly, the band’s fan base is heavily weighted on the female end. This is not what it aimed to be identified with, and it is not what it envisioned people viewing them as. By deleting all forms of social media and essentially reinventing themselves, the members of the band have given people the opportunity to reject social norms and view them first for who they are as a band, along with the music they put forth, rather than labeling them in regards to their fan base.</p>\n<p>The music in itself speaks clearly about their ideas about society and even challenges the way that people view them, whether or not they think they know who The 1975 is. Before the release of their latest album, <em>I Like it When You Sleep for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It</em>, fans and media were granted the opportunity to get to know the band and the vision behind the album through numerous pop-up shops, interviews and listening parties. This humble, generous effort has allowed people to get a better sense of what the new era is all about.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It goes without saying that The 1975 is phenomenal when it comes to their artistry and their hunger to remain themselves despite the criticism they face. This sets them apart from other artists in the media. Their constant effort to enhance their aesthetic is evident in their performance, and it is exactly what makes them an absolute joy to watch live. There are many bands that rise in fame and fall behind the scenes never to be heard from again, but The 1975 is a band that could rise and fall with people still willing to move mountains to hear from them again. The beauty in their performance is so innocent and pure that it will change a person’s outlook on the world for days to follow. Santa Barbara natives have the chance to witness this beauty first-hand Thursday, April 21 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, and because the band is in demand in numerous parts of the world, there is no question that missing this show is a decision you’ll regret.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It was April 7, a Thursday night, and the venue was nowhere near its capacity. Nevertheless, DiMona proceeded to play his remix of Blackbear’s “90210.” There was a wave of head bobbing as the song played and the pace stayed moderate as he went on to play his song “I Just Want You.” After giving the crowd a taste of his own music, DiMona filled the venue with some nostalgic vibes as he played “Bartender” by T-Pain. Everyone sang along as the soulful jam boomed from the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>After the R&amp;B hit was over, it was clear that everyone was ready for more. At this point what was once a room filled with a few heads bobbing back and forth was now one with the nightclub aesthetic. A slight pause went by, and the words “Your love is fadin’” filled the room as the song “Fade” by Kanye West came on. The audience rocked back and forth with intensity as the funky vibrations shook the room. Not only was DiMona able to make great use of one of West’s newest songs, but he also managed to resurrect the sensational music of R&amp;B artist Frank Ocean as he played his song “Lost.” The crowd yelled in agreement with the DiMona as he questioned “Yo, when is Frank Ocean going to drop that album though?!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69887\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69887\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1782381608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69887\" data-attachment-id=\"69887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69887\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As DiMona made subtle transitions between electronic and rock music — ranging from from Blood Orange to music with a much more house-like feel — the energy levels only became higher and more intense. It was clear that DiMona was feeling the liveliness of the crowd, seeing as he was jumping up and down and encouraging those around him to join him. Just as the crowd thought he was finished, the DJ yelled, “Yo, you guys down to listen to a song I’ve never performed before?” Of course, the audience yelled in excitement as his never before heard tune came on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was a bittersweet ending to an amazing set list, but the night was not over at the Hub. Goldroom had yet to reach the stage but everyone continued dancing, keeping the upbeat mood alive. The tone was set in stone as the Goldroom crew proceeded to set up their variety of instruments.</p>\n<p>There was a unique array of sounds infused throughout the venue as the six-person group began their set for the night. The musicians began the night by performing their song “Only You Can Show Me,” and as the audience engaged themselves in the sensational sounds that the tropical band had to offer, it was clear that the Gauchos were digging the music.</p>\n<p>“Her voice is crazy!” yelled one of the audience members in reference to the female vocalist. For a brief moment the singer stood in the middle of the stage, and as she sang “Till Sunrise” the melodious lyrics pierced through the crowd and echoed throughout the venue. Josh Legg, the mastermind behind the production and lyrics of the music Goldroom has to offer, has stated that he enjoys switching up the musicians for his live performances. It makes for a unique show with unpredictable outcomes seeing as everyone is artistic and skilled in their own way.</p>\n<p>Along with the beautiful vocals that Goldroom provided came the energetic instrumentals. From the drums, guitar, bass, keyboard and even the chimes, every instrument played a crucial role in the live performance. It was dance music with a serene and passionate feeling throughout the crowd. Although it was a bit awkward when Legg announced, “Find somebody to make out with,” as the song “Fifteen” came on, there was a sense of relief when Goldroom played what was deemed to be a new song called “Breaks.”</p>\n<p>“This song can be a break from anything, really.” Legg said, and it was just that: a break from reality.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, you guys are beautiful!” said Legg as he and the rest of the group made their way off the stage. However, that was not enough for the Gauchos on that Thursday night; they fiended for more, and as they yelled, “Encore!” over and over again, Goldroom came back to the stage to perform one last song for the deserving audience. In an interview a few days prior to the concert, Legg stated that a good crowd for him is one that is not “cool” but is willing to embrace the music, dance and have fun. That night, the Hub’s audience, without a doubt, met his expectations.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_69888\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69888\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185469295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69888\" data-attachment-id=\"69888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69888\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Vocalist Tyrone Lindqvist, keyboardist Jon George and drummer James Hunt find themselves on State Street April 20 to perform a sold-out show to their loving, supportive fans.</p>\n<p>The alternative dance group hails from Sydney, Australia, where their debut album <em>Atlas </em>topped the album charts at No. 1 in 2013, while their second album<em> Bloom </em>made its way to the top in 2016. Getting inspiration from other electronic dance and indie musicians and enthusiasts like Flume and Foals, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>decided to shake up the basis of electronic dance music. By using real instruments in their music, the group has taken their artistic ability and authenticity to a whole new level. With mellow vocals combined with an upbeat rhythm, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL</strong> is just one of the few acts changing the EDM genre.</p>\n<p>The “You Were Right” producers formed back in 2010 where they performed at house parties to crowds of about 50 people. It wasn’t until 2011 — when they released their first EP, <strong><em>RÜFÜS </em></strong><em>EP — </em>that things started changing<em>.</em> The group released four singles from <strong><em>RÜFÜS, </em></strong>all helping carve their path to success. <em>Atlas</em>, the group’s first full length album, scored the trio a chance to take their “Desert Night” tour to North America. Making stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and New York, the tour marked great success for the three members. <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>was on the rage, and the trio kept trucking along until they found themselves playing at SxSw, where they blessed the hearts of hundreds of fans. The group has sure come a long way from performing to a crowd of 50 to performing to crowds of hundreds, sometimes even thousands of people in one night. At SxSw, they played three shows in one night alone.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nominated for six ARIA Music Awards, it wasn’t until the group’s 2015 Best Dance Release nomination when they were crowned the winner for their single “You Were Right.” <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>have fought their way into the mainstream and the battle has paid off. The trio continues their 2016 “Bloom” tour by playing week two of Coachella and then flying off to their home country for the Australian and New Zealand leg of their tour only to return to the states in June to play festivals like Firefly, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza and Outside Lands.</p>\n<p>Even with all the nominations and festivals the group hasn’t strayed from their humble beginnings. Being friends for years, the bands cohesiveness is very secure. They keep each other level when things get too overwhelming. The comradery shared between the three has resulted in fantastic live shows with an excess amount of vibrant energy. At only six years old, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>is knocking on the front door of every barrier and kicking them down.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

artists that typically would not think to stop in the city. Thanks to the large capacity of the venue, SB is advancing on the charts as a concert city next to places like Los Angeles and San Diego and has even sparked the interest of arising hip hop legend G-Eazy. G-Eazy will be making a stop in Santa Barbara on the second leg of his “When It’s Dark Out” tour Tuesday, April 19 and, as per usual, will not make his exit without leaving his mark on the beautiful city.</p>\n<p>Young Gerald, aka G-Eazy, knew from the beginning that he was going to make it big, yet he remained humble and let other people find out for themselves just how good he is. His lyrics are often misinterpreted as being filled with the typical tangents of cockiness that rappers rant about in the midst of their fame; however, G-Eazy’s perception of himself and what he is capable of has remained constant throughout his music even as he evolves as an artist. When this is attributed to his character, it is easy to decode the messages in his music in a negative light and dislike him as a person. On the contrary, his love for his fans is monumental, and it is evident that he will not rest until he puts the Bay Area on the map. As well as repping the Bay, he is known for collaborating with a number of well-known artists like Mod Sun, Blackbear, Kehlani and Marc E. Bassy.</p>\n<p>Even with the restless back-to-back shows on his lengthy tours, G-Eazy found the time to open another leg of “When It’s Dark Out” shows after the release of the album. The album itself received an overwhelming amount of reviews from astounded critics on various social media outlets and music blogs. The first leg of the tour featured surprise guest appearances from artists like Chris Brown, YG, ASAP Ferg and Diddy, leading fans to describe his shows as something directly out of a movie. That being said, when G-Eazy books a show, he brings a show. Fans at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be in for a treat and will get to discover exactly what things happen when it’s dark out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The concert began with a performance from Kitten, a relatively recent L.A. band who have also opened for No Doubt and Paramore. They were followed by Junglepussy, a New York rapper with a cult following who has attracted the notice of artists like Nicki Minaj and Erykah Badu, and headlining the concert was big-name queer artist Le1f. Le1f’s most popular song “Wut” has over 3 million hits on Youtube, but, based on the turnout on Friday night, it seems very few of them came from UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Third-year theatre and dance major Eleanor Gribbin, who was visiting from Davis for the weekend partly because of the concert, was one of many surprised and disappointed by the size of the crowd, which seemed even smaller in the large venue.</p>\n<p>“We arrived really early to make sure we would get in and then there was a tiny crowd, which frustrated us,” Gribbin said. “Perhaps the organisers were relying on the ‘big names’ to fill the room for the event, but the lack of promotion just led to the UCSB queer community seeming to be even smaller than I expected.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It’s possible that this lack of promotion was due to the concert being organised last minute since the Hub website instead said they would be holding an “Education for All Ball” that night, leading to confusion among some attendees. There was even a table at the event inexplicably covered in plastic masquerade masks, possibly intended for this cancelled event.</p>\n<p>However, despite the turnout and a fairly late start, everyone involved did their best to make the evening a success. The drag queen emcee did a great job amping up the crowd with her irreverent humour and genuine enthusiasm for the acts, and none of the performers seemed to let the various issues with the event — such as fairly poor sound quality — get to them.</p>\n<p>Kitten, the opening act, had by far the smallest crowd and gave an extremely high-energy performance, with lead singer Chloe Chaidez whipping her hair aggressively while singing. As an indie-rock band they were an odd choice to open for two rap artists, but they nevertheless got the crowd moving and cheering even if no one seemed to know any of the songs.</p>\n<p>Junglepussy by contrast gave the kind of effortlessly casual performance for which she is known, not dancing as much as the other performers but still a commanding stage presence. Her lyrics are boastful and antagonistic but also humorous enough that the audience is always aware she is playing a character, often one that seems to parody contemporary male rappers. Her playful confidence and unapologetic crassness would be enough to make her charming, but her music is elevated further by her commentary on the reality of being a black woman. Lyrics such as “Compliment her if she’s light/ If she’s black don’t get her hype,” in “Pop For You” send up serious social issues like colorism but in a way that is succinct and punchy.</p>\n<p>This made her a fantastic artist to pair with headliner Le1f, whose lyrics frequently address complicated political issues, even if this can sometimes escape notice beneath his incredible beats and rapid-fire flow. His song “Hey” features the lyric “Ask a gay question / Here’s a black answer,” sending up his presentation as merely a “gay rapper” in mainstream media and how the ways in which his sexuality and race intersect are often ignored.</p>\n<p>The fact that his delivery is quite low and not so loud meant his performance was the most adversely affected by the venue’s poor sound. Still, Le1f is not only a great rapper but a fantastic producer and dancer and honestly could have stopped rapping entirely and still given an incredible performance. Even his style was impressive — he somehow got his fairly long braids to stick straight up like antennae and his energy only seemed to increase as the performance went on, culminating in him jumping over the barrier and dancing in the crowd.</p>\n<p>Third-year theology student Claire Nuttal noted that in this way the small crowd was almost a positive since “the performers capitalised off the intimate setting by interacting with the audience members and joking around on stage.”</p>\n<p>“I came expecting great music,” Nuttal said, “but didn’t anticipate the incredible feelings of inclusivity, pride and celebration emanating from the artists and the crowd in equal parts.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

But the hyping wasn’t done yet; once Gibbs’ DJ and ESGN (Evil Seeds Grow Naturally) crew got on stage, they played popular hip-hop hits (the word bangers comes to mind) for about 30 minutes before Gibbs came out. This lasted about twenty-five minutes too long, but witnessing an entire crowd sing Kanye’s earth-shatteringly stupid line, “If I fuck this model / And she just bleached her asshole / And I get bleach on my T-shirt / Imma feel like an asshole,” will be forever ingrained in my mind for better or worse.</p>\n<p>Even with all the hype awaiting Gibbs, he delivered exceptionally well, coming out all guns blazing with “Rearview,” a song off his newest album with a borrowed hook from Tupac’s “All Eyes On Me.” Like Tupac, Gibbs has been surrounded by drugs and violence his whole life, as is made all too clear from his more “mild” lines like, “My neighbor used to hit my alley just to buy a bag,” or, “Pill habit heavy, hella bars I can’t even count / L.A. County Jail, ain’t got my moms here to bail me out.”</p>\n<p>After each song, Gibbs stopped to take off a layer, sip Patron or make fun of his DJ, even getting the whole crowd to chant “chug, chug, chug” as the peer-pressured mixmaster put down half a bottle of Patron. While I was under the impression that this was something reserved for frat parties, it’s nice to see that abusing alcohol is a social class-less (and classless) equalizer. When Gibbs was ready to move on to the next song, he would incite another chant without fail, this one being: “fuck police, fuck police, fuck police.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Gibbs played all the crowd favorites and even went a cappella on some of them to do the most impressive speed rapping this reporter has ever heard. Despite the dropped beats, the crowd loved it, especially the fan next to me who repeatedly screamed, “I fux wit that,” after every unaccompanied freestyle. Gibbs tucked away this skill during his most popular songs like “Old English” or “High,” allowing the crowd to join him in his anthems to the finer things in life: 40s and blunts.</p>\n<p>In short, Gibbs murdered it. Showing more raw energy than anyone who smokes a half ounce of weed a day should be capable of, he supersaturated a crowd that seemed already at full enthusiasm. As a train-robbing, gangster-rapping, ex D1 football player, a less-informed person might make the assumption the Gibbs would come off as the cocky, too-good-for-you type. This person would be shocked to see Gibbs shaking hands, signing vinyls and joking with the crowd after the show. This person would be even more shocked to see the recent cute baby viral video that features “Gangsta Gibbs” as a humble dad (<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjcB_PJhB0\">youtube.com/watch?v=_SjcB_PJhB0</a></em>). A man of many talents, Freddie Gibbs confidently captivated an intimate Velvet Jones crowd; anyone who gets the chance to see him should take it up in a heartbeat.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Quantic’s unique blend of traditionally acoustic music styles (cumbia, salsa, jazz) with edgy, electronic experimentation creates the perfect ambience for cruising through L.A. at 2 a.m. Fortunately, it also makes for a rockin’ party. On Friday, April 1 the England-born, Columbia-taught, New York-based artist came to Santa Barbara to play at Velvet Jones.</p>\n<p>Opening first was Givers and Takers, a self-described “bliss-rock” band comprised of former Gauchos. Standing at the front of the stage, lead vocalist and keyboardist Zack Greenwald wore loose, colorful clothing and a blue-and-yellow scarf around his head. He looked as if someone had tie-dyed a Hare Krishna. Givers and Takers played a relatively smooth electronic set. Most of the time, the bliss-rock label was fitting, but the band often digressed into harder chords and vocals more representative of true rock than anything particularly indie or pop.</p>\n<p>Following Givers and Takers was Xenia Rubinos. Rubinos shares some of Quantic’s Caribbean influences, but blends these with soul, hip-hop and R&amp;B. She herself boasts a smoky, soulful voice that’s simultaneously playful, oddly reminiscent of Kate Nash. She also used the full extent of her physicality on stage. Rubinos extended her arms out, twining her fingers together. She beckoned the audience closer and gracefully twirled her arms. With her unique vocals and movement, the singer crafts a distinct and affecting stage presence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally, Quantic himself mounted the stage with his band. They all sported shirts with green and pink triangle patterns, the kind of design that would be at home on a dashiki. Quantic (aka Will Holland) maintained an unassuming stage presence. He never stood front and center, keeping slightly back and to the right, level with his drummer and saxophonist.</p>\n<p>All three members of the band pivoted between instruments. Quantic himself played guitar and accordion; percussionist Wilson Viveros played a drum set but also hopped out front at times to rapidly beat on a single drum; regular Quantic collaborator Sylvester Onyejiaka alternated between his sax, a keyboard and a flute that he piped notes out on. Together the band fuses Latin and Caribbean vibes with electronic twists. At some point Quantic pulled out his accordion and dove into cumbia, the dance-oriented, tropical-sounding genre popular in Latin America. Holding his accordion, Quantic bounced up and down on stage, smiling widely. Later, the band played a more melodic, melancholic song Quantic called “Time is the Enemy.” The lighting designer wisely chose to bathe the stage in dark blue light. Rather than lose the audience with this more somber tune, Quantic managed to captivate them. After quite a few minutes of this, the band reverted back to a lighter, more danceable tune.</p>\n<p>One fourth-year UCSB student, Tomek Buras, spoke with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about what drew him to Quantic.</p>\n<p>“I love the blend between the Latin and the Caribbean vibes, and I love the electronic fusion,” said Buras.</p>\n<p>Quantic is known for his preference for sharing the stage, and Friday night was no exception. L.A.-based collaborator Jimetta Rose repeatedly returned to the stage to invigorate the show. Rose exuded a formidable and exuberant presence, calling to the audience and fiercely belting out spirited lyrics. Rose embodies soul — she howls her words. At one point she implored the audience, “Tell the person next to you ‘you’re beautiful.’ We all need to hear those words, every single day.” A guy next to me said “you’re beautiful” and held out his fist to bump. I repeated the words and bumped him, not sure if what happened was a sincere exchange of genuine human affection or just a laugh. Maybe the performers do have a mystical sway in instilling a sense of free love and community into the audience through groovy Latin vibes. Certainly one elderly hippie lady (55 plus years old) seemed to believe so as she mounted the stage and swayed about, clearly drugged-out. Velvet Jones security did not share this communal euphoria. Drummer Wilson Viveros thought it was hilarious.</p>\n<p>Viveros as a musician is remarkable. The older Columbian man maintained a perpetually bemused look on his face as he plunged into several drum solos throughout the show, all done with lightning speed and precision.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his performance, Quantic played music from his most forthcoming album. The beats emanating from the speaker exhibited a harsher techno, but remained highly danceable.</p>\n<p>As his performance concluded, the audience began a chant of “Uno mas!” After a moment, Quantic came back up and spoke. “I’m afraid I’m done, due to Santa Barbara zoning laws — they’re searching people for drugs.” A moment passed. “April Fools” he said, smiling, 45 minutes into April 2 before coming back up with his band to play several mas.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6775,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6774,6773,6772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Max Goldenstein Serenades Batcave","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"On the bright Sunday morning of March 6, the Daily Nexus was joined by Isla Vista musician-slash-rugged heartthrob Max Goldenstein for a session in the Batcave.

You folks may know him as the front man of local garage rock group Sun Daes, frequent headliners at the backyard parties and park concerts you know and love. Their voluptuous, groovy sound has made them one of I.V.’s most memorable bands, accommodating equal amounts of jiving and thrashing from their listeners.</p>\n<p>However, Max has a budding and ambitious solo career as well; with material up on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/max-17\">Soundcloud</a> and <a href=\"https://aqualounge.bandcamp.com/releases\">Bandcamp</a>, his extremely varied style blends elements of electro, psych, folk and lounge music into a heady brew of sonic delight. His quick wit and merry, easy-going disposition come out in his lyrics to great effect, and anyone who’s spent more than a month in I.V. should be able to relate to his words. We sat down to an interview together, after he’d finished playing:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: So, how does playing on your own differ from playing with the band? Is there one you like more than the other?</p>\n<p>Max Goldenstein: No … no, I don’t think so; they both have different things about them that are good and stuff that’s bad. We’re all great friends, so it’s amazing playing and being up there [with them] and there’s definitely a groove you can get into. When you’re in a band, though, it’s not just your sound, it’s all of yours; you have to be willing to compromise. When I’m on my own, though, there’s definitely … there’s a freedom that comes with that. I can explore my own ideas for songs and lyrics and all that.</p>\n<p>DN: Have you ever thought about picking up a backing band or something like that?</p>\n<p>MG: I have, yeah, but there are problems you run into. It basically means finding people — drums, bass, whatever — who don’t have a problem taking more of a backseat position. They have to be okay with playing <em>your</em> music. What that means, I think, is that the band probably shouldn’t be their central thing — their only thing. I’m still looking right now, actually. Can you actually put that in the article?</p>\n<p>DN: Yeah, of course.</p>\n<p>MG: Thanks.</p>\n<p>DN: Do you think you want to keep on doing music as a career?</p>\n<p>MG: Well sure, I mean, that’s the dream, right? I’d love to spend the rest of my life in the studio and playing shows and touring and shit — all that stuff’s really … I really enjoy it. But being able to share my music with other people — with the world — that’s what’s important for me. The music scene, it’s a really hard place to continuously make money in, so a lot of what I’ve been thinking about is how to make money, at least enough to live on, while I can keep writing and performing. So having a job that I like, something cool — that’s why I’m in marine bio — to pay for food and rent and all that so I can do what I really want in my own time; I think I’d be fine with that, too.</p>\n<p>DN: Definitely, yeah. I know that’s something a lot of people here are wrestling with. Taking things back into more of a local view, what do you think is unique about being a band in Isla Vista, as opposed to someplace else?</p>\n<p>MG: I think … I think it’s really unique to be in a community made up almost entirely of inspired kids who not only want to have fun, but are trying to go after their passions. The arts scene here, it’s really special. I’ve met some of my favorite people here and I’ve seen some crazy shit. I don’t think you could go anywhere else and find the same number of — and how huge they are —the parties and shows around here! It’s a fucking crazy place to be in a band. There’s always somewhere you can play.</p>\n<p>DN: And for either you yourself or the band, do you think living in I.V. has shaped your sound at all?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh definitely, yeah. It’s like I was saying: I.V.’s such a unique place that it makes for really great inspiration; there’s plenty of song material here. It’s also a brilliant place for just fucking around, and we do a lot of that and I feel like that’s reflected in the music we make.</p>\n<p>DN: Nice, nice. And now while our readers do love to hear about the music, they also want the dish. So I gotta ask, what were you listening to in middle school?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh god. Uh, gimme a sec … Avenged Sevenfold, I guess? Rise Against? All that shit … I think I had one Slipknot song at one point.</p>\n<p>DN: My Chemical Romance?</p>\n<p>MG: Hahahaha, oh sure, yeah.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The spacious events center transformed into a large venue, providing both standing room and seating accommodations, yet most of the crowd were without a doubt drawn to the stage. Despite doors opening at 8:00 p.m., nearly two hours went by before the opening act, Tor Miller, took the stage. In most cases this would call for an uproar of anger from the crowd, but there were no hints of angst threatening to taint the atmosphere. Whether it was the feeling of being surrounded by peers who understood or the number of impaired people in the crowd, the night was too mystic to let impatience get in the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69614\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69614\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1497867743\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69608\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69614\" data-attachment-id=\"69614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/grouplove-warms-it-up-at-deltopia-show/grouplove-by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Grouplove by Lorenzo Basilio 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69614\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Just as the crowd seemed to be losing an ounce of hope, Tor Miller and band took the stage and set the tone for a night that would send everyone present through a spiral of emotions. He may have been a New York native, but the students at UCSB welcomed him with open arms. Although most people were not aware of who he was, he was captivating enough to keep their attention. His stage presence — along with the band members that surrounded him — allowed him to do so. Much to the crowd’s dismay, a portion of his set was a bit on the slower side, yet it enhanced the vitality of songs to follow when the songs did pick up the pace.</p>\n<p>Tor Miller was particularly enjoyable because of his ability to shift between various styles of sound. It is evident in his performance alone that he takes the risk of toying around with various genres instead of finding one that works and sticking with it. Every soulful, alluring song aided to the feeling of wanting to stay inside that room just a little longer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The room erupted in the weight of a thousand lights intensifying with every scream. It was apparent that the band was happy to be there, and the crowd only reciprocated the feeling. The connection between the band and the crowd was dynamic, and the rapport among the students alone was fascinating. The sublime unison could only be explained through the music that played in the background, and while getting lost in the moment, the realization came that this performance was something that only UCSB students had experienced. Rather than just simply seeing Grouplove do what they do best and calling it a night to remember, it became a night to remember because we were able to experience together.</p>\n<p>Grouplove’s energy, along with their artistry, is unequivocal. There is no questioning the fact that they brought a much needed revival to the campus after a long break. It was an extravagant night that one just had to be there to experience, especially with the performance of their hit single, “Tongue Tied.” Every bit of apprehension evaporated the further they went down the set list, and it would be an understatement to say that the school will miss them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

coming to Velvet Jones this Thursday, April 7. An authentic and self-described thug, Gibbs has been hustling his whole life, whether through rapping, dealing drugs or in a more literal sense playing D1 football. He has led a high-stakes and highly dramatic life and shows no signs of slowing down. Born Fredrick Tipton in eastside Gary, Indiana, Gibbs welcomed the street life early on. After getting kicked out of Ball State, his criminal motivation kicked into high gear. He has since been arrested for gun possession, drug dealing and robbery and has even worked as a pimp. In a more 1800s-style crime streak, Gibbs crossed over to the Wild Wild West outlaw realm as he began robbing freight trains. Rap pulled him out of this lifestyle briefly when he signed onto Interscope. This venture was short lived, and after it crumbled he returned to the lifestyle he was trying to escape. Eventually he returned to rap, putting out a staggering three albums, five mixtapes and seven EPs since 2010.</p>\n<p>While you would probably know him best from his recent song “Old English” or the Kanye remix “Cocaine Parties in LA,” his discography is as complex and extensive as his life. Whether it’s his gritty <em>Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik</em> (referencing Outkast’s <em>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</em>) or compilation mixtape <em>The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs</em>, Gibbs offers lyrically driven, all-too-real gangsta rap. His 2014 album <em>Piñata</em> was a collaborative album with producer Madlib which received widespread critical acclaim and earned him a spot on Pitchfork’s Top 50 Albums of the Year. Concertgoers should expect a lot of hits from this album and his most recent one, <em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>a trappier, heavier album that sounds more like his older mixtapes.</p>\n<p>In a world where everyone from the streets thinks he can rap and everybody who can rap thinks he’s from the streets, Gibbs demands the world realize a genuine street/rap crossover can still thrive. Whereas highly debatable lines like Drake’s “Started From The Bottom” make many people cringe, it doesn’t seem like much of a stretch when Gibbs refers to himself as “Gangsta Gibbs” or “Freddie Corleone.” As a man whose entourage has literally taken bullets for him, who has himself sold drugs and struggled with addiction, who has actually, seriously robbed a freight train, Gibbs has safely secured himself a position as a bona fide badass. One can only wonder how much more aggressive he’d be if he wasn’t smoking a reported half ounce of weed per day. This all being said, his show will provide an interesting perspective that most UCSB students cannot relate to while simultaneously blowing the fucking roof off of Velvet Jones with some of the most uninhibited, unapologetic rapping you’ve ever heard. Not a bad deal for $25.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-06/freddie-gibbs-putting-the-g-in-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-06/freddie-gibbs-putting-the-g-in-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-06/freddie-gibbs-putting-the-g-in-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-06/freddie-gibbs-putting-the-g-in-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-06/freddie-gibbs-putting-the-g-in-velvet-jones/","id":6774,"author":{"id":722,"name":"Thomas Mannell"},"related":[6773,6772,6771],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UMO Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=658%2C438&ssl=1","description":"Psych-rock set Unknown Mortal Orchestra to warm up for their Coachella act right here in SB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69440\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69440\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"375272114\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69440\" data-attachment-id=\"69440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/e2f8750d/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=658%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"658,438\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"e2f8750d\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=658%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=658%2C438\" alt=\"Courtesy of pitchfork.com\" width=\"658\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of pitchfork.com</em></p></div>\n<p>In 2010, a mysterious, hip new track was floating around the ether, gaining acclaim from popular and respected music bloggers. After some time trying to track down the creator of this delectable new flavor of lo-fi rock, singer and guitarist Ruban Nielson finally laid claim to it under the name Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Thus, with “Ffunny Ffrends,” UMO was born. Fueled by this pre-prepared hipster blog following, the New Zealand/Portland-based group hit the ground running, releasing a self-titled album in 2011 that gained acclaim from Pitchfork Media for its unique lo-fi garage rock sound with just the right touch of psychedelia.</p>\n<p>With the recent success of their third album, <em>Multi-Love</em>, it is no surprise that Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s upcoming show at SOhO has been sold out for weeks. You may know UMO from last summer’s Outside Lands lineup, though you may not have seen them given Mac DeMarco’s conflicting show time. Be this the case, I sincerely hope you’ve claimed your SOhO ticket, because an Unknown Mortal Orchestra performance is so grungy yet perfectly executed that it turns passive music listeners into connoisseurs and brings connoisseurs to tears.</p>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from classic jazz and hip-hop artists like Chet Baker and MF Doom, UMO’s vintage sound peppered with affected guitar and hypnotic bass lines is the stuff of underground rock dreams. Though their recordings are testament to this, it is impossible to comprehend the depth of talent each musician in the band possesses individually without witnessing one of their seven-minute intra-song jams during a live show. So, calling all lo-fi fanatics, all garage rock enthusiasts and all psychedelic devotees; this April 14, 9 p.m. show is the one for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/","id":6690,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6689,6688,6687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Preview: GoldHub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The instrumental DJ plays at The Hub on April 7.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69250\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69250\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"947142357\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69249\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69250\" data-attachment-id=\"69250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/goldroom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=250%2C203&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=888%2C722&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C650\" alt=\"Courtesy of nesthq.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>nesthq.com</em></p></div>\n<p>On Thursday, April 7, UCSB’s very own Hub is in for a funky night filled with good vibes as DJ, producer and songwriter Josh Legg — better known as Goldroom — will be taking the stage, along with special guest Matt DiMona. Goldroom is particularly unique from other DJs because his career began when he was part of the band NightWaves. Since then, Legg has taken on the pseudonym Goldroom and found much success by providing his fans with amazing and relaxing sounds.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based artist sticks close to his roots, as his name stems from the city itself. Legg sees LA as one big gold room, and this is what influenced him to choose the nom de plume. Legg’s first few songs, “City Girls” and “Morgan’s Bay,” were heavily influenced by LA and in a way were odes to the beautiful city. Being an artist from such a big city is difficult because one is surrounded by hundreds of other young people with big dreams. Nevertheless, Legg found his way in the music industry and has brought along some friends. After working as a solo project for some time, Legg turned Goldroom into a trio when he was joined by keyboardist/vocalist Mereki Beach and drummer Nick Sandler.</p>\n<p>After transforming into a live three-member ensemble, Goldroom’s sound has evolved into a mixture of tropical and upbeat production accompanied by soothing and melodious vocals. Since 2013 his performances have evolved into live shows involving four members, adding in a bassist. Although his sound is categorized as dance music, Legg integrates instrumentation and vocals that lead to a much more passionate and ardent feeling than the work of typical EDM artists. His distinctive melody has paved the way for him as he has made notable appearances at some of the most prestigious music festivals and venues in the landscape; for example, he joined reputable artists such as Flume, Mac DeMarco and Toro Y Moi at last year’s FYF festival.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goldroom is on his Pacific Coast Trip tour right now, performing in places ranging from Portland to Santa Barbara to Indio. Luckily, Josh Legg took some time from his busy schedule to answer some questions from the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some artists that get caught up in fame and materiality, it is clear that Legg has a genuine passion for what he does. Legg digs deep into his creative process and makes sure to keep his vibe unlike that of many other DJs.</p>\n<p>“I like to think of myself as a songwriter that happens to make dance music,” he stated when asked about the lyrics in his music.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that he produces his beats, Legg also holds the vocal component of his music near and dear to his heart.</p>\n<p>“Songwriting is the core,” says Legg. “The lyrics allow me to convey a message.” It is evident that he finds the connection between him and his listeners to be a vital aspect of his creative process.</p>\n<p>Legg sticks close to his roots and constantly finds himself going back to where he started: playing an acoustic guitar.</p>\n<p>“I was always playing acoustic guitar and writing songs. When I was younger I was always in band.” In fact, he also says that whenever he gets writer’s block what seems to help him gain some motivation is going straight to his acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, Legg urges others to “make a challenge for yourself.”</p>\n<p>His songwriting has definitely progressed since his first EP, and Legg shared that this is surely going to be noticeable in his upcoming debut album.</p>\n<p>“My songwriting has gone to a new level,” claims Legg.</p>\n<p>Not only have his songwriting abilities advanced, but he has also found himself embracing more performers in his live act. Throughout his entire career he has only had a six-piece group once, but he feels as if this helps in making his performance much more electrifying.</p>\n<p>“Performing live is normal for people who are performing other people’s songs,” states the songwriter. “This adds a unique flavor from other artists.”</p>\n<p>Rather than being close-minded, Legg believes that Goldroom is about trying new sounds and taking risks. “When I close my eyes, this is what I pictured Goldroom to be,” states Legg.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Santa Barbara will have the opportunity to experience the sensational and tropical vibes that Goldroom has to offer at The Hub on April 7. Doors will open at 8:30 p.m. and students can buy their ticket at the A.S. Ticket Office for $14 or $21 at the door.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/","id":6768,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6767,6766,6765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Batman v.

Who does DC think they’re kidding? Zack Snyder is not Christopher Nolan, and having him return to direct this movie (AND the upcoming Justice League films) is tantamount to quality suicide. Once again we have been given a colorless, joyless, thoroughly flawed piece of work. Snyder’s indifference to his own film can be glimpsed in the opening credits, where “Batman v. Superman” appears in the corner of the frame and fades out in a brief moment without any pomp or enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>The basic framework of “Batman v. Superman” is simple: take the fight from the end of the acclaimed <em>The Dark Knight Returns </em>comic, mix Lex Luthor and Doomsday into the mix and profit.</p>\n<p>The first problem here is that they forgot to add any dramatic weight to that aforementioned fight, which is orchestrated by the flimsiest of reasons (thinking back, there really weren’t any to begin with) and concluded just as lazily. Ben Affleck’s Batman feels compelled to go after Superman because he had a bad dream or vision or some such unexplained plot convenience that convinces him that he has to kill Superman instead of talking to and/or learning about him. One training montage later, he’s all beefed up to fight the blue boy scout.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Except Superman (Henry Cavill) is not a boy scout. He’s still the pondering, dour Jesus figure from the last movie who engages in some truly awful love dialogue with the ever-annoying Lois Lane (Amy Adams). His character has not a shred of fun in his body, nor wonderment. It’s all angst. At one point, he even goes off to the mountains to mope — something that is apparently supposed to be a big deal, but it’s so rushed and inconsequential that it completely lacks emotional impact. And it seemed more like an excuse for him to have a vision so that a certain actor from “Man of Steel” could cameo.</p>\n<p>Speaking of excuses, there’s one specific segment of the film that felt like it was supposed to be amazing and game-changing, but it wasn’t: Batman sends Wonder Woman (who is on the receiving end of a sly panty shot at one point … gender equality!) videos of other superheroes for her to watch. It didn’t serve the plot in any fashion; it was just a gratuitous reminder from Snyder that more films are on the horizon. The screenplay BS is aplenty: Batman and Luthor decide to kill Superman at the exact same time. Superman is framed for killing African mercenaries, incorrectly implying that Superman uses guns and that Americans care about what happens to African mercenaries. There are some appallingly banal lines: “Superman is just a farm boy’s dream,” followed up with, “That farm boy’s dream is all some people have.” It’s as if Chris Terrio took writing classes from George Lucas.</p>\n<p>But I digress; let’s address the butchered villains. Let it be known that Jesse Eisenberg’s performance as Luthor is not the problem with his character — it’s that he doesn’t even actually play Lex Luthor. His character is not a cold, calculated weapons manufacturer with an inferiority complex. He’s just some rich brat with a lot of time to kill who happens to speak almost exclusively in metaphor. It’s okay to reinvent a character, but the character we get is annoying, doesn’t talk like an actual human being and has no motivations to speak for his actions. All he needed was to step in crap and we’d have a new Jar Jar Binks.</p>\n<p>Doomsday (Robin Atkin Downes) doesn’t feel like Doomsday, either. The significance of his comic book iteration (being so powerful and strong to be able to beat Superman bloody) is lost. It also doesn’t help that he looks and sounds far more like the cave troll from “The Fellowship of the Ring.” As for his creation, it basically just boils down to the so-called Luthor putting General Zod’s body in goo and seeing what happens. Why does he do it? How does he know it will work? Because it was in the script, and that’s more insight than the movie will ever give you.</p>\n<p>Now, you might be under the impression by now that I didn’t particularly like this movie. To which I say you are completely right. But “Batman v. Superman” is, of course, not without its merits, of which there are a scant few.</p>\n<p>Affleck fits comfortably in his role as Batman (who gets the best action scenes), and having him use a voice-changer to deepen his voice as opposed to emulating Christian Bale was a nice touch. He kicks ass with lethal prejudice, immediately setting him apart from his predecessor. While this lack of qualms about killing is darkly refreshing (and allows for some cool homages to “The Dark Knight Returns”), we are given little insight into what drove him to take such drastic measures.</p>\n<p>Zack Snyder is certainly not incompetent when it comes to cinematography — that much can be said. He frames and sets up shots beautifully, and the editing never feels so frenetic that you can’t tell what’s happening in the action scenes.</p>\n<p>But regardless, the minuses heavily outweigh the plusses of this film.</p>\n<p>If you want to watch Superman combat Doomsday, Luthor or Batman, there are a slew of animated films that you can find on the Internet that will whet your appetite. They’re better written and shorter, too.</p>\n<p>Now all we can do is wait and see if “Suicide Squad” will serve as the antidote to the poison that is Snyder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung recommends reading </em>The Dark Knight Returns<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While this idea may seem appealing to some people, it diminishes the reality of what the band is actually capable of. No matter what Grouplove is depicted to be, they have a song for everyone, and this Saturday at the Thunderdome they will grace each UCSB student with the immense artistry that lies in every one of their songs.</p>\n<p>Grouplove formed with its five members in 2009 purely out of passion, and these friends were unaware of just how big they were going to become. After playing their first show mid-2010, they proceeded to go on tour with bands like Foster the People, The Joy Formidable, and Florence + the Machine. After just two short years of being together, the name Grouplove was on everyone’s radar, and before they knew it they were performing explosive sets at large festivals like Glastonbury, Coachella, Outside Lands and Lollapalooza to name a few.</p>\n<p>In the midst of these defining performances, the band managed to release both their self-titled EP, <em>Grouplove</em>, and their debut album, <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em>, all in the same year. <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em> features their hit single, “Tongue Tied,” and if that song alone is not reason enough to see them live, both the debut album and EP feature blissful, captivating sounds. The melodies tend to be contradictory in the way they appear when compared to the meaning behind the songs, but that is what separates Grouplove from other, more ordinary acts. There is no attempt to sound like anyone else, nor is there an attempt to market happiness by pretending to be happy. The concept that someone can listen to them and battle a multitude of feelings that have nothing to do with happiness but still feel overwhelmed by the forthcoming perception of joy is what makes this band so alluring. Their live set only amps up this joyousness, with the band members playfully and energetically hopping around to hype up their ecstatic audience.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although this is not the way that many people pictured spending their first weekend back from Spring Break, this alternative makes other options seem inferior.

Gnash as an artist is particularly unique because he is able to create his own genre with such subtlety that there is no room for comparison. Many have debated the idea, but he neither identifies as a singer nor rapper, nor solely a DJ, but just as an artist. Attempting to label his creativity would be difficult, so if, for whatever reason, necessity called for a label, it would simply be “Gnash.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash, along with Goody Grace and Julius, is a Los Angeles local, and he is certainly not a stranger to the scene. Performing at shows with artists like Kehlani, Mod Sun and Blackbear, his fan base has expanded enormously over the last several years. He has been friends with these artists for some time, so it is not accurate to say that this is where his fan base originated from, but rather it helped him to become known to the people who had looked past him for some time. His first EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is crafted as a vivid representation of someone who has loved and lost, yet refuses to let it tear them down completely. This is a common theme throughout his early music, giving people an inside look at his heart and mind while also letting people know that is okay to feel something even when it feels like it can destroy you. Gnash’s latest EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, includes this similar truth, but it is much more lively. As he stated in an Instagram post immediately following the release of the EP, it includes many of the life lessons he has learned about moving on and being content with being alone, a healing that is completely evident between the lines of every track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash’s music is all about his journey, and it makes it easier to get to know him as a person. If his sounds are ever too difficult to follow (which is nearly impossible), then it is a joy to get to know his personality through the updates he provides for his “dreamers” via Twitter and Snapchat. His love for his fans shows through his constant hard work and interactions, and there is never a time in which you would second guess supporting him. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to experience Gnash’s music live comes around often, but it increases with intensity with each performance. His energy on stage is overwhelming, and his ability to adapt to any stage or fan base is what makes his performances so enjoyable. If someone is not familiar with his music, they will be sure to check him out after the show. For someone who has seen Gnash a number of times, I know for a fact that he will bring everything he has to the stage. Everything he does, he does it for the people that support him, and he is never quick to forget that his fans are the backbone of his success in addition to his worth ethic. Velvet Jones is a very intimate venue, so it will only enhance the Gnash experience. Getting to see Goody Grace and Julius (who are featured on several songs with Gnash) alongside him is going to make this show go down history. Santa Barbara will be raving about these Los Angeles natives for days, and the lucky ones will be able to say they were there to experience it.</span></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/gnash/ihateuiloveu</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/","id":6773,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6772,6771,6770],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":30,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
