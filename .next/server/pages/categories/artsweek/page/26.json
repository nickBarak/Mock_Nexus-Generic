But as they arrived, ready in their rain boots and warm layers, they found that Treasure Island was the grossly unprepared one. The festival was continuously way behind schedule and even canceled artists minutes before they were about to come on. Here’s the low-down on some of the ones that actually ended up playing:</p>\n<p><strong>Young Thug</strong></p>\n<p>After a wait of three hours — not 30 minutes of which passed by under a torrential downpour — Young Thug finally took the stage. He apologized for travel complications and quickly started his set. The crowd was very low-energy; after waiting three hours, it was to be expected. Throughout his entire set, Thug would try to hype up the crowd and ask, “If you’re ready to turn up, say, ‘hell yeah,’” but the “hell yeahs” were pretty sad. However, this didn’t last for long: Toward the end, when he started singing “Pick up the Phone,” the crowd’s enthusiasm was back. You could hear people singing and dancing along, with various shouts of, “It’s LIT!” during the song. Despite the rough start, Young Thug definitely put everyone back in a good mood by the end.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Glass Animals</strong></p>\n<p>Glass Animals put on a solid performance despite the short amount of time they had on stage. The creepy, cool voice of Dave Bayley spread through the crowd and gave everyone chills during “Toes.” The chilly, windy, post-rain atmosphere matched the vibes of Glass Animals’s set. Playing songs from both <em>Zaba </em>and<em> How to Be a Human Being</em>, the set combined older favorites with newer jams. “Cane Shuga” — a song from their recent album that isn’t very popular, what with its simple synth background beats — stood out like a hidden gem. Finally, Glass Animals ended with a favorite: “Gooey.” Everyone in the crowd was singing and moving to the catchy, buzzing tune.</p>\n<p><strong>Zhu</strong></p>\n<p>Zhu is a performer who is never afraid to change it up. At his TIMF set, one of his band members began with a guitar solo of “The Star-Spangled Banner” with a huge projected Zhu flag on the back screen. This differed from his performance at Coachella, which was a bit more mysterious with lots of fog and smoke. Both of these performances, however, show Zhu to be an artist who values production as much as music. Every one of Zhu’s intros and outros was remixed in new and unexpected ways. Many of the songs he played were accompanied by energetic guitar and saxophone solos, and he also sang all of his songs live while DJing. His voice, a high falsetto, only further adds to his mysterious, sensual aesthetic. The lights flashed black, white and red as the screen depicted hints of a cityscape. As the crowd listened, the combination of vocals and the dark visuals added to Zhu’s enigmatic persona. In addition, attendees who’d caught him just a few days before on his tour confirmed that his Treasure Island set was completely different. Zhu is always two steps ahead of the crowd. Toward the end of his set, he started playing “One Minute to Midnight,” but just as the crowd started anticipating the song, he immediately transitioned to one of his more hype tracks, “Hold Up Wait a Minute.” Zhu continues to push live mixing to its boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Tycho</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73362\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379438551\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73362\" data-attachment-id=\"73362\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73362\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tycho recently dropped a new album, <em>Epoch</em>. His live set, which was during the late afternoon, was a bit more mellow of an experience than many of the other acts. But don’t confuse mellow for boring; combined with his visuals, which comprised of Grand-Canyon-like natural footage superimposed with funky oranges and pinks, his sound seemed to take you away to another place. Although he played specific cuts from all of his albums, his entire set seemed like one connected experience with seamless transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sylvan Esso</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73363\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"949299361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73363\" data-attachment-id=\"73363\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73363\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73363\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Thought to be just a one-album project, Sylvan Esso recently released a single, “Radio.” This surprised many fans, giving them hope that they would release a new album. The DJ-singer duo who rarely tour was one of the more special performances of the weekend. Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath took the stage and announced that this would be their last performance before they dropped their next album, and excitement ensued. Amelia captivated the audience with her crazy dance moves and crazy-good voice. At this point of the evening on the second night, there had already been so much rain that the mud covered people’s shoes. But it didn’t matter: When she sang  “H.S.K.T.,” everyone in the crowd was dancing and pointing to their heads, shoulders, knees and toes as she sang the chorus.</p>\n<p>This was Treasure Island’s 10th Anniversary and last year on San Francisco Bay’s Treasure Island. The eclectic lineup and their talented performances were the main attraction. But while the performances themselves were phenomenal, the music festival was supremely disorganized. Some of the main acts during the evening like Duke Dumont, Flight Facilities and James Blake were cancelled due to rain or wind.

As a curtain of fog swirled beneath their feet, a singular point of light oscillated back and forth across a great black backdrop. Like Blake’s music, it was minimal yet incredibly transfixing.</p>\n<p>The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new. “I’m gonna try and play some of my newer material,” he announced before diving into his famous cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love” from his self-titled debut back in 2011. This is how James Blake operates; he sets up rules for the listener, and then shatters them into millions of glittering bits almost immediately after they’ve been formed. During “Modern Soul,” for example, a pulsing white rectangle we’d grown to accept as a central part of Blake’s backdrop suddenly rotated into a brilliant, multicolored ring, leaving everyone in the room subsumed in the best possible way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although they were originally intent on retaining their air of ruthless politeness, the crowd of sedate Santa Barbarans were finally pulled from their theater seats during his <em>excellent</em> remix of U.K. dubstep act Untold’s “Stop What You’re Doing.” According SB local David Shin, “We didn’t expect this type of energy! For him to bring everyone out of their seats like this … it was unreal.” And unreal it was; I’d never seen a crowd dance in a way so sensual yet collectively understated.

The tawny synth maestro clearly loves putting on a show (I’d never known the Clavia Nord 4 to be a full-bodied instrument!), but after spending a set in his presence you get the feeling he’s there for the audience, not for himself. However, Blake’s musical performance really only made for half of the concert experience. The background visuals by abstract artist Matt Clark — current creative director of United Visual Artists — were perfect ekphrases of Blake’s sound. When coupled with intricate lighting changes of every shape and color on the spectrum, they made for the most thoroughly audio-visual experience I’ve ever witnessed. Apart from a minor technical which incited Blake to charmingly scrap a song in the middle of it, the performance went off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Nearing the show’s finale, Blake and the band finally gave into chants from the front few rows, tiptoeing their way into 2013’s “Retrograde,” Blake’s most popular track. No matter how many times you listen to it, there’s always a certain subtlety to Blake’s sound; it sneaks up on you. Even though everyone in attendance knew this track by heart, when it finally swelled into the chorus it was as if we were standing at the feet of an eclipse.</p>\n<p>Paying homage to his long-time fans as well as his own roots, Blake finished the set with “The Wilhelm Scream” from his aforementioned self-titled. The song is a cover of one his father, James Litherland, wrote. Even through the electric fervor and downtempo drum rhythms, you can really hear the affection in Blake’s voice. Through Blake’s traditional style of minimalist repetition, the song builds upon a wall of soothing reverb like a set of waves gradually overtaking a shore. The end result is a wall of noise reminiscent of one of My Bloody Valentine’s famous “holocaust sections,” but with the intent of melting the audience into a puddle of their own sentiments rather than reducing them to dust.</p>\n<p>After a scant few minutes of frenzied cheers, Blake returned by his lonesome to perform a serene, two-song encore. As his solemn silhouette casually lit up the empty backdrop, he serenaded us with his cover of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You,” leaving more than a few eyes in the room in a state of pleasant dampness.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73315\" style=\"width: 4414px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1575840009\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73315\" data-attachment-id=\"73315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/james-blake-arlington-theatre-oct-18th-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=4404%2C3146&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4404,3146\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct  18th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73315 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct 18th 2016.

So do you think you could … let this one just be me?”</p>\n<p>As I sat there mulling over how I’d never be asked to <em>shut the fuck up</em> so pleasantly again in my life, Blake, voice alone, began spinning the first verses of “Measurements.”</p>\n<p>“God damn …” a man in front of me whispered, clearly struggling to contain his whoops of pleasure. In the most wonderfully masturbatory show of musicianship I’d ever seen, Blake proceeded to harmonize with himself six or seven times over, his vocal cords weaving a veritable tapestry of sound. These voices then gradually trickled off one by one as people stooped down to grab their jackets and purses, and Blake’s set closed gracefully like the bud of a morning glory at dusk.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/","id":6747,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6746,6745,6744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joey Alexander Trio: Prodigious","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alexander’s original compositions are simply inspirational.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on the island of Bali, Indonesia, Alexander first encountered a keyboard at age six and immediately knew piano was his calling, jazz piano in particular. Not only could he pick up virtually any blues composition by ear, but he could also improvise with a level of experience far beyond his years. In 2014 at the young age of 11, the musical genius was discovered by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and flown out to New York for Marsalis’s all-star jazz concert at Lincoln Center. From there, his career took off. He’s released two solo albums and been nominated for two Grammys in just the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is Alexander’s first time on the road. He was accompanied by Juilliard graduate and two-time Grammy winner Ulysses Owen, Jr. on the drums and Berklee College of Music alum Reuben Rogers on upright bass. Celesta M. Billeci, executive director of the Arts &amp; Lectures program, introduced the band by simply stating, “I don’t even know how to describe what you’re about to see tonight except: Wow.”</p>\n<p>Greeted with tremendous applause, Alexander opened the show with a classic by John Coltrane called “Calm Down” followed by several original compositions. He received continuous encouragement from bass player Rogers, who periodically yelled out a supportive “yeah!” The trio as a whole was tremendously in sync; Alexander thrives in the syncopated rhythms of jazz. He studied classical music as a child, like the works of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, but always wanted to elaborate on it. Classical music is supposed to be played as written, though; you’re not supposed to embellish. Jazz, however, allows the freedom to express yourself, unlike classical composition, and you can tell it’s what the young virtuoso is meant to be playing.</p>\n<p>His bandmates perfectly complemented him with many impressive solos displaying their remarkable skills on their respective instruments. If you think Miles Teller was good in “Whiplash,” you obviously haven’t seen Owen, Jr. play yet. His hands moved so quickly they completely blurred. Rogers, the “jokester” of the gang according to Alexander, was having the time of his life on stage, yelling out and swaying with the music.</p>\n<p>Now, if you like music — which I assume you do if you’re reading this article — you’ll like Alexander’s original compositions. They’re simply inspirational. It’s more than just genius in its arrangement, it’s the notion of a 13-year-old following his dream and truly succeeding. Every silence and pause was precise and intentional. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel deep down in your core. It makes you want to get out of your seat and cheer, cry and grin. Many audience members shook their heads in disbelief. After the first piece, the woman to my left let out a quiet “Wow,” one you could only hear if you were sitting directly next to her. Everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>After the show, Eleanor York was more than excited to share her thoughts about Alexander’s performance. “It was phenomenal. The way everyone played off of each other and with each other; it’s amazing for anyone, let alone a thirteen 13-year-old,” said York, who has followed Wynton Marsalis as a frequent patron of the Arts &amp; Lectures events for years and knew when Joey got his endorsement he was someone to look out for. “It was just delicious.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a word other than “adorable” to describe the pianist, but gifted will undoubtedly suffice. When he speaks, though he is not completely fluent in English, he is humble and compassionate. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Hans Christian Andersen: “Where words fail, music speaks.” While Joey’s English may not be the best, he certainly makes up for it with his music. His sound and soul are much older than 13 years, and when he plays you forget about his age. This was evident in the <em>two</em> standing ovations he received.</p>\n<p>I was left with only one question at the end of the night: is Joey good for a 13-year-old, or is he just good? I think it’s safe to say he’s just good.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

weekend and stands to deliver another fantastic showing of artists. Past years have featured bands like last year’s headliner and indie rap superstars Run the Jewels, as well as multi-talented drummer and music producer Andrew W.K. and YouTube violin sensation Lindsey Stirling. This year, over a dozen different acts will perform throughout the weekend with bands from all across the indie music spectrum, both locally and nationally renowned.</p>\n<p>Oct. 22 should be the highlight of the festival as STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra headline the first day of the New Noise Block Party part of the festival. Both groups are often described as psychedelic, so they should really complement each other and make for a great night of chill vibes and interesting sounds. While these groups might not have the same fervor and excitement as other past headliners, their sound really matches the relaxing beach town vibe of Santa Barbara, and the direction the festival is going is very promising.</p>\n<p>While STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra might be the most attention grabbing, plenty of other bands will be playing throughout the weekend as well and promise to bring another dynamic to the festival. One standout is Ho99o9 (pronounced Horror) which performs on Saturday night at Velvet Jones as part of the festival. The punk-rock flavored experimental New Jersey rap group remains well-known in the underground hardcore rap scene for their explosive, high-energy shows. The group, which has been compared to Death Grips, headlines the more hip-hop inspired part of the festival along with their opening act Ashe Blanco, a female California-based MC.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If Saturday doesn’t appeal to you, don’t fret.

After the lull of summer, I.V. is again filled with students enjoying their community and ready to see some fun-filled live shows. With so many new and returning Isla Vista residents, the UCSB Community Housing Office, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District welcomed everyone with the Kick-Off Community Concert. The event served as a housing fair, educational center and venue for Isla Vista talent.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’oyo’ Park was set up as a maze of tables for the event. Representatives from many I.V. property providers were there offering cookies, lemonade and information about their properties. The Isla Vista Tenants Union sparked interest in passersby with games and prizes such as succulents and various home goods. A photo booth was nestled in the back of the park with fun hats and accessories. The atmosphere was festive and welcoming as people talked, ate and lounged on the grassy hill of the park’s amphitheater. What really drew the crowds, however, was the upbeat music permeating I.V.’s usual cacophony of sounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Real Savage Henry was first to perform, reinstating their presence as a staple of the Isla Vista music scene. They brought their usual persona of fun and humor to the stage, wearing novelty accessories like a captain’s cap and a sailor hat. Wilder Kehke danced barefoot across the stage with his guitar and a carefree air of enjoyment. Even when many people were still roaming through the tables instead of sitting down to watch, the band remained lively and interactive with their initially small audience. They called out “Thank you!” to the applauding group at the very back of the amphitheater. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s first few songs were mellow and jazzy, reminiscent of coffee-house tunes to match the laid-back atmosphere of the event. The songs were heavy on the drums, with drummer Will Hettel laying down a slow but strong beat that pounded through the space. The beginning of the set had an improvisational feel as each song had an occasional piano solo. Andrew Mac Innes mixed up his steady pops of keyboard with sweeping scales and fast trills of notes. Guitar solos were common as well as Kehke held out long, wavering notes combined with quick, short bursts of riffing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Pagliassotti’s steady bass transitioned into quick, accented strumming as the beat began to pick up. Quick bursts from Mac Innes’s keyboard mirrored the faster bass line. Hettel’s drumming grew louder and faster as Kehke’s hands flew up and down the guitar in frequent, wailing riffs. The pace never stayed too intense for too long, however, as the music quickly softened again to more mellow rhythms. Savage Henry’s atmospheric yet still distinct style at the event was a welcome sound for many after being away from Isla Vista all summer.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73266\" style=\"width: 252px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1581113689\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73282\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73266\" data-attachment-id=\"73266\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/file_006/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=300%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"file_006\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73266\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?resize=242%2C362\" alt=\"Kaityln Haberlin / Daily Nexus\" width=\"242\" height=\"362\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kaityln Haberlin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next band to the stage was The NITWITS, giving event-goers a more rock-n-roll style to enjoy. Graham Bunce’s upbeat, catchy bass line got the audience bobbing their heads and swaying to the beat from the very beginning, as spontaneous bursts of drums and symbols added a flair of excited energy to the song. Drummer Ryan Lowe demonstrated his talent with seemingly no effort, his sticks flying across the drums and every beat strong and intense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While singer and guitarist Bryan Rawn’s raspy voice was very characteristic of classic alternative rock, it was actually because he was under the weather, not imitating singers from the ‘90s. “As you can probably tell, I’m a little sick,” the singer apologized with a smile, “but you know what, we’re having fun!” The band had to stop one song because Rawn’s weakened voice wasn’t strong enough for the vocals, but they picked up again right away with another high-tempo number. Rawn hit impressive high notes with all his might and kept the song’s energy up with fast guitar strumming and stylish riffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who were new to the Isla Vista community or simply those who have been away for a while, the concert was an inclusive opportunity to learn about I.V. living while also getting a taste of the local talent. The organizations and bands of Isla Vista are here to kick off another great school year. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Barbara. Wild Nothing is a critically acclaimed indie-pop band solely created by Jack Tatum in 2009. At the time, Tatum was finishing his senior year of college, but that didn’t stop him from releasing Wild Nothing’s debut album <i>Gemini,</i> which brought an immense amount of attention to Tatum’s dreamlike and nostalgic style.</p>\n<p><i>Gemini </i>features a variety of songs that showcase Tatum’s unique approach to creating music. The songs feature beautiful and whimsical keyboard sounds as well as simple but sweet additions from the guitar. <i>Gemini </i>ultimately evokes a sense of longing through Tatum’s dim lyrics, but still presents hints of light by pairing soft pop beats with peaceful rhythms. The initial song on this album, “Live in Dreams,” immediately represents the more somber approach Tatum takes when writing lyrics and creating sounds. Other songs on this album such as “Bored Games” and “Summer Holiday” are calm, beautiful tracks that force you to feel nostalgic for anything, whether it’s childhood, old love or a past memory. Wild Nothing knows how to be an innovative force in the current indie music scene.  Tatum effortlessly makes you grasp the sentiment and longing you’ve pushed back and tried to rid yourself of. The talented indie artist cultivates within listeners that it is okay to be feel nostalgia and to reflect on the beauty of the past. This is ultimately what Wild Nothing does to us with <i>Gemini </i>and this is without a doubt what to expect if you catch them in concert at the SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on Tuesday, Oct. 18.</p>\n<p>Tatum continued to develop his synth-heavy brand of music with the release of perhaps Wild Nothing’s most acclaimed album, <i>Nocturne.</i> This album shares similar stylistic traits as <i>Gemini,</i> but Tatum dives deeper in providing a more soothing and holistic sound for listeners. The leading tracks on<i> Nocturne</i>, “Paradise” and “Shadow,” are undeniably luscious, gentle and blissful songs. This album and Wild Nothing collectively are the epitome of ‘80s dream-pop, a unique quality that Wild Nothing brings to the current indie scene. Each song on <i>Nocturne </i>possesses delicate rhythms and soft, alluring sounds that paint light-colored images. “Through the Grass” and “Nocturne” are just two of the many songs on this album that give listeners a truly introspective experience, and this is what makes Wild Nothing such an avant-garde project in the indie music realm. Overall, Tatum does an exceedingly well job of crafting glimmering and echoing sounds with <i>Nocturne</i>, and provides listeners a simply beautiful, elegant and delicate album to indulge in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wild Nothing is definitely worth seeing live.

other movie goers on Friday evening as they eagerly awaited the commencement of the screening of “Swiss Army Man.” For only $4, the event, hosted by UCSB’s Magic Lantern Films, boasted a night of tasty snacks, interesting trivia, themed prizes and, most importantly, an appearance by Daniel Scheinert, one of the directors of the film. The event delivered, with an arsenal of buttery complimentary popcorn at the entrance, a plethora of film posters and a swiss army knife, ready to be given away to lucky prize winners. Upon stepping into the screening area, the first sight was that of the night’s special guest, who looked nearly indistinguishable from the college students who surrounded him, chatting to a large group of curious and attentive viewers.</p>\n<p>“Swiss Army Man,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the story of Hank, played by Paul Dano (“Little Miss Sunshine” and “Love and Mercy”), who is stranded on a desert island. He discovers a corpse named Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame), whose body has special powers. Hank manipulates Manny’s powers, which consist of a number of odd bodily functions, to navigate their way back home. Throughout their hilarious and heartfelt journey, Hank teaches Manny what it is like to be alive and Manny reminds Hank of what it is like to not be alone.</p>\n<p>The movie thrived off of its disarming and offbeat humor, in a series of uncomfortably funny moments in which Manny attempts to understand and adapt to the conventions of the world. Yet, it displays a vulnerable, raw human connection between Dano’s lonely and undeniably relatable Hank and Radcliffe’s compassionate corpse.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film was written and directed by Scheinert and his creative partner Daniel Kwan, who, together, call themselves The Daniels. This is Scheinert and Kwan’s first feature film. However, the two previously garnered internet fame through their innovative music videos for artists such as Foster The People and The Shins. One of their more terrifically absurd videos, created for Lil Jon’s song “Turn Down for What,” was even played before the screening of the film. Second-year Erin Sim remarked, “It was so interesting to see how their style translated from the music videos to the big screen. It was obvious some of their previous work influenced the movie, especially in terms of the special effects.”</p>\n<p>Following the screening, Scheinert climbed onstage as T. Rex’s “I Love to Boogie” blasted through the speakers of the auditorium. He explained that he “drove down from L.A. with a bunch of [his] friends with that song on repeat throughout the whole trip,” and expressed his newfound distaste for it. During a Q&amp;A session, he mentioned that the film contained many musical inside jokes much like that one, including a ballad rendition of “Cotton Eye Joe” performed by the directors’ friends, Manchester Orchestra, and the frequently hummed tune of Jurassic Park. “I always hum that or ‘Kiss from a Rose,’ by Seal, [while working with Kwan],” Scheinert joked.</p>\n<p>The audience was graced with tidbits of trivia, including how the appearance of a fictional creature in the film came to be. “Daniel Radcliffe’s bodyguard dressed up as Bigfoot one day and just ran in the back of shots,” Scheinert revealed. And when asked where the multitude of fart sounds littered throughout the movie were obtained, he chuckled, replying, “I guess it’s kind of illegal, but we actually took tracks from this video online called ‘101 Real Farts’ … We wanted the farts to be unique, because every one was supposed to be a character development moment.” As the audience roared with laughter, he expressed his hopes that “someone will recognize their own fart in [the] movie.”</p>\n<p>One audience member commended Scheinert on the impact of the film, explaining that they had gotten up to go to the bathroom during the middle of the movie, but upon seeing “everyone in pure awe, laughing and smiling” they rethought their decision. Scheinert alluded that the film’s creation process was similar: hard to abandon. He advised aspiring filmmakers to “make sure your movie is fun to make,” and to treat it like “a therapy project.”</p>\n<p>“This was one of the best audiences I think we’ve seen,” said Stephanie Lynch, Scheinert’s girlfriend. “It was a really great group of people. Everyone was so into it; it was really cute.”</p>\n<p>The turnout seemed to impress a fair few people. “This was one of the best [screening experiences] we’ve ever had,” said Magic Lantern producer DJ Palladino. “There were these guys from Ventura who made [‘Bellflower’], which The New Yorker called ‘the future of cinema’ and these guys came and they were amazing, and there were only twenty-five people in the audience. ”</p>\n<p>The evening ended in a way left up to individual interpretation, much like the film did, when Scheinert was asked what the point of “Swiss Army Man” was. Implying it was a reflection of his and Kwan’s journey as filmmakers, he added, “It’s sort of about how we all make up movies in our head.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

palpable as the intrepid first guests trickled into the spaciously small UCSB Art, Design, &amp; Architecture Museum, accosted by the grotesque and jagged faces of monsters from beyond the stars. Alien faces leered with eyeless sockets as patrons braved this bold new world, a chaotic and perhaps nightmarish universe conceived in the mind of an otherwise affable and unassuming genius.</p>\n<p>The architect of this madness is Michael Westmore, who stood, benevolently mild, to the left of the entrance in a corner surrounded by the cybernetic arms and blinking eyes of the hellish Borg. Walking among the gnarled faces of Cardassian soldiers and Klingon warriors, coexisting in lifeless harmony, an appreciation for the spatial complexity of the sculpting involved in the creation process dawns on the viewer.</p>\n<p>Foam latex molds and sketches of alien facial features adorned the walls of the exhibit. Full head casts of Sir Patrick Stewart, who played the levelheaded Captain Jean-Luc Picard in “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” rested beside a display detailing the drawing-board evolution of an alien nose.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Getting to “[see] how this stuff is made” became a near-overwhelming experience.</p>\n<p>Local Trekkie commitment was literally visible in the quantity of “Star Trek” themed apparel strolling through the exhibit, including a fully dressed Uhura. The line to speak with Westmore became saturated by avid fans yearning to convey their love of the show and its role in their development. Countless pictures were snapped with the man responsible for the foodstuffs of so many of their young imaginations.</p>\n<p>But the generational gap presented no problem, as young fans of both “Star Trek” and Westmore’s successful game show “Faceoff” also waited to converse with the familiar artist. A gaggle of freshmen with nominal connection to either “Star Trek” or Westmore’s other extensive works were giddy with admiration at meeting the man behind their favorite show, something that to them has become “a family experience.” Westmore released some good news: fans have another three seasons of “Faceoff” to which they can look forward.</p>\n<p>While Westmore’s legacy spans over 80 movies and television shows, encompassing the likes of “Rocky,” the “Munsters” and “Raging Bull,” his family’s work in the Hollywood makeup industry offers some of the most prolific contributions to the history of Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Beginning with Westmore’s grandfather George Westmore, who founded the first movie makeup studio in Hollywood, the Westmore family has been involved with movies as influential as “Gone With the Wind” and created creatures as notorious as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Creature From the Black Lagoon. The Westmore name is so ingrained into Hollywood that stars such as Elizabeth Taylor coddled Mr. Westmore as a child, while Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro became family friends.</p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus, Westmore began his studies as a fine arts major, hoping to diverge from the movie-making sculpting that surrounded his childhood by becoming an educator. With heavy training in the arts, Westmore soon decided to pursue what he found to be his passion, art history, with the hopes of museum curation, archaeology or professorship.</p>\n<p>Invariably, he ended back in Hollywood for a movie production internship with his uncle, Bud Westmore. Finding a mentor in John Chambers, another of the most influential makeup artists in movie history, Mr. Westmore held fast to the profession of his forefathers, even becoming involved with the CIA in a project involving fake identities and disguises.</p>\n<p>The evening continued as the UCSB Pollock Theater presented a 20th anniversary screening of one of Westmore’s more famous Star Trek movies, “Star Trek: First Contact.” While the theater was not packed, a vibrant population of Trekkies arrived to show their support.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73120\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1840219882\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73156\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73120\" data-attachment-id=\"73120\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73120\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"William Emmons / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73120\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With a few opening words from Westmore and Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan, the audience delved straight into the heat of a zero-g spaceship battle above Earth’s atmosphere. Enthralled in the voyage of the Enterprise E and her crew, UCSB students and locals alike were shown the complexity and otherworldly craftsmanship of the Westmores’ makeup work in creating both the cybernetic Borg menace and the Federation allies (the likes of Data the android and Warf the Klingon).</p>\n<p>As the credits rolled, a healthy ovation surrounded the appearance of Michael Westmore’s name.</p>\n<p>A small Q &amp; A session led by Ryan followed the film. Questions focused primarily on “First Contact” and Westmore’s more famous works, including his interactions with stars like DeNiro and Bette Davis. Though much was said of the business aspect of the art of movie makeup, Westmore did offer advice to aspiring artists, drawn from his personal experience as well as his role as a guide for artists navigating the modern industry on his show, “Faceoff.” “[In today’s world] you have to go to school, in order to be competitive and to know what you’re doing. The training offered in school is highly recommended.”</p>\n<p>Westmore touched on his training, which involved classical makeup (i.e. beauty work) and an emphasis in sculpting.</p>\n<p>Westmore’s exhibit, Lifeforms, is open until Dec. 4. The exhibit will reopen after a winter hiatus until April of 2017. Admission is free for UCSB students with valid ID.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73156\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73156\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/","id":5846,"author":{"id":699,"name":"Daniel Gitlin"},"related":[5845,5844,5843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Laura Marling is a Darling","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14068238_10153949798312972_5351778634474286955_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14068238_10153949798312972_5351778634474286955_n.jpg?resize=783%2C519&ssl=1","description":"It’s rare for one denuded voice and an old, acoustic guitar to transfix an audience so completely as Laura Marling did this past Friday night.

At the SOhO venue candlelit tables are were sprinkled around the room like confetti, the bar buzzed with the low thrum of conversation and black and white photographs paying homage to the likes of Van Morrison, Blondie and Keith Richards graced the red brick walls. Beneath them, sofas tempted attendees into their cushions in repose before the show. This venue recalls something of a New York loft or sophisticated London pub, making Marling’s choice to play the last night of her West Coast tour here especially important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The elfin artist emerged donning a pair of vintage Levi jeans and a flowing white blouse, an old soul-come-avant-garde ingénue. Hazy blue light flooded the expectant stage. Marling began her set with “Take the Night Off,”  the opening track to her fourth album</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once I Was An Eagle</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Albeit 30 minutes late, the whole room took in the sound of her haunting vibrato at once. Her voice and guitar instantly took command of the intimate space. The small stage of a quiet, California venue is where Marling feels most at home, unfettered from her mythological status in England. Marling unfurled the rest of her 60-minute set in a kaleidoscopic series of glissando rises and falls, her songs an amalgam of jovial conversation and piercing insights into the nature of love, life and loss. Marling’s nu-folk style lends itself to live performance. Her songs float into the silent crowd and settle in the minds and hearts, resonating with authenticity that is foreign to the studio album. Alternating between her own songs and covers of the iconic Bob Dylan’s “Up To Me” and Dolly Parton’s “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,” Marling gave a nod to her artistic lineage and returned to her own footing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first song was met with enthusiastic applause.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I saw an otter yesterday,” Marling confided in the audience, “and I had a small malfunction of excitement. 10 years ago the British otter population was nearly extinct and now they’re thriving. So next time someone says something bad you can tell them the otters are thriving at least.” She followed this cheerful observation with the building beat of the jaunty “Short Movie,” the titular track of her most recent album. Disappointingly, after only a couple of minutes she stumbled and had to abandon the song, admitting, “I can’t remember how to play it, I’m so sorry!” Nevertheless, having made an immediate friend in the night’s audience, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her blunder was forgiven by the sound of emboldening cheers, and she ensued with a unique cover of famed country singer Dolly Parton.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short Movie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> signposted a new direction in Marling’s musical career. It stepped away from her lyrically dominant acoustic folk and moved toward a more reverberating, electronic sound, inspired by the loneliness she felt during her revelatory years in Los Angeles. Yet, within the dimly lit, intimate walls of SOhO, both new and old songs were stripped bare and reimagined by a more mature, worldly Marling, a far cry from the diffident young woman of her past. Her acrobatic vocals jumped, twirled, twisted and landed flawlessly throughout “Wildfire,” her pensive tone and elastic range imbuing each lyric with a vulnerability that made them accessible. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">piercing high notes of “I Feel Your Love” sailed over the sound of her guitar as she leaned into her soprano with new weight, while the jubilant thrum of a colloquial “Rambling Man” got everybody’s feet tapping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling’s dusty vocals have matured as age and experience have facilitated growth into an evermore textured sound. Jack Wallace, a third-year English major, described Marling as “a total delight onstage. You could tell how in love with her instrument she was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling’s affinity with her instrument is perhaps what distinguishes her authenticity as an artist. Her lyrics, meanwhile, conjure a web of images that suddenly resolve into relatable sentiments that touch each member of the audience individually. Marling has described her lyrics as “personal, but not confessional.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By valuing sentiment over specificity, Marling bestows her listeners with the power to find their own meaning in them. It is this quality that ensures </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her feelings are translatable. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Curtis, a graduate student at UCSB, admitted, “They’re incredibly subtle, her lyrics. But they’re extremely perceptive. I teared up twice.

The pair released their debut single, “Warm On A Cold Night,” in 2014 after meeting at a university in their home country earlier that year. Bandmates Andy Clutterbuck and James Hatcher have been writing and producing music for two years, putting out music they describe as “warm and sensual, late night vibes, serious baby-making sounds.” Their new-age romantic sound even parallels their band name: the meaning of HONNE is “true intention” or “true desire” in Japanese.</p>\n<p>HONNE signed to the label Super Recordings in 2014, and later that year released their EP “All In The Value” on which Clutterbuck croons about the decline of a relationship over Hatcher’s mellow, ambient beats. Their artfully done visuals, albeit melodramatic, won “Best Music Video” at the London Independent Film Festival. Following the release of their “Coastal Love EP” in 2015, HONNE set out on a festival tour of England and Europe and performed on BBC: Radio 1’s Big Weekend. Their sound has been developing the whole time, leaning away from the sparseness of their early stages and developing into a fuller, more cohesive sound as they progressed as a duo. The developments in Hatcher’s production have been exciting and enjoyable to listen in on. HONNE has a lot to celebrate in 2016; they released their debut album “Warm On A Cold Night” on July 22 and embarked on their first North American tour earlier this autumn. HONNE has a growing fanbase and there is no end in sight. Their stop in Santa Barbara is not one you want to miss.</p>\n<p>After a quick listen to their discography, you’ll realize HONNE’s self-description is spot-on. There is a quality reminiscent of James Blake in their production and an emotional wistfulness in HONNE’s voice, with lyrics inspired by the overt sensuality of 80s R&amp;B legends. HONNE credits a lot of their musical influence to Michael Jackson, both in production style and in songwriting. That inspiration is evident; raw emotion inspired by the pop legend can be heard in both HONNE’s tracks. A comparison to Bon Iver’s new album would also be apt; their production style is similar and their lyrics are similarly themed, but HONNE’s tracks lean toward a more upbeat and peppy side, both in pace and emotion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The soulful pair’s track “Someone That Loves You” has seen a surge in popularity over the past few months and is arguably their most popular tune. It’s racked up over 13 and a half million plays on Spotify and features the voice of fellow burgeoning British singer, Izzy Bizu. “Someone That Loves You” is a catchy, romantic tune, akin to their other work, but the dueling vocals of Izzy Bizu and Andy Clutterbuck is what heightens this song’s appeal. Bizu’s smooth voice and Clutterbuck’s rougher tone mix perfectly to make “Someone That Loves You” one of HONNE’s best works so far.</p>\n<p>HONNE’s sensual, romantic and melodic sound made them a hit on the London nightclub scene, and their dynamic electronic production and soulful lyricism made them travel across Europe and beyond. Come see the magic being made in person Friday, Oct. 11.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73017\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/uh-huh-honney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73017\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/uh-huh-honney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/uh-huh-honney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/uh-huh-honney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/uh-huh-honney/","id":6728,"author":{"id":714,"name":"Cade Nauman"},"related":[6727,6726,6725],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek & Co.

Though Bon Iver hinted at an inclination toward auto-tuned vocals and suggestions of computer-generated tunes in their sophomore, self-titled album, I’m not sure anyone expected such a jarring electro-folk hybrid in the band’s recently released third album, <em>22, A Million</em>.</p>\n<p>The first song, “22, (OVER S∞∞N),” resembles more of hodgepodge of eclectic sounds than an introductory track. There’s a recurring, single-note, synthy feedback noise, some melancholy-yet-jazzy sax and a healthy serving of interestingly affected voice samples. Though not necessarily unpleasant, it is clear from the strangely formatted title and arguably even stranger sounds that the band is trying to shock listeners. The band is possibly even trying to indoctrinate us into an almost experimentally electronic and noisy album, not for those who know the band only by “Skinny Love.” Though they’re listed nearly everywhere as an “indie folk” group, I’d describe this stage of Bon Iver’s career more along the lines of “if Phil Collins went in a really weird direction after leaving Genesis.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And, indeed, it does seem very ’80s-inspired, which is something a few fans will be expecting given the group’s prior work. This is not a decade that brings folk music to mind, but, as I’ve mentioned, neither is this album. Aside from retro bass and techno touches, the record is often reminiscent of EDM with its heavy doses of electric drums, static-y beats and what I call “bass farts.” A few times, I expected Kanye to jump in with a verse.</p>\n<p>Tracks like “715 – CRΣΣKS” and “29 #Strafford APTS” are more like the band’s well-known tunes in their almost gospel-like, building harmonies. Still, these vocals masquerade behind a proverbial shitload of Auto-Tune and are really just a chewed-up bone thrown to curmudgeonly fans like me who prefer the rainy-day vibes from old jams like “Holocene” and “Blood Bank.”</p>\n<p>Though the album is not particularly consistent with its two predecessors, it is consistent among itself. The music itself sounds interstitial, never quite resolved, while the lyrics reflect this with tales of waiting and searching. With autumn finally showing its colors (figuratively here in Santa Barbara), I was hoping for a more traditional set of songs from Bon Iver to listen to while wallowing in self-pity in the midst of midterms and romanticizing the fleeting rainy weather. That is not what I got, and, in all honesty, I will probably never listen to this album again. I encourage you to test the waters of this new style yourself, but if you need me, I’ll be listening to “Re: Stacks” on loop pretending <em>22, A Million </em>never happened.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72936\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"883125479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72936\" data-attachment-id=\"72936\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/solange_cover-1475240092-1000x1000/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"solange_cover-1475240092-1000×1000\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72936\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Saint / Columbia\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72936\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Saint / Columbia</p></div>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table</em> by Molly Guillermo</p>\n<p>Solange Knowles’s <em>A Seat at the Table </em>is a declarative demonstration of black excellence in music. The 21-track R&amp;B album, which Solange wrote, arranged and co-produced, is part memoir and part evaluation of racial politics in America, as well as a celebratory expression of black identity.</p>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table </em>contains remarkably smooth beats produced by Raphael Saadiq and spoken-word interludes performed by rapper Master P, but it also produces a strong thematic progression of Solange’s search for self-empowerment. The album celebrates blackness in a world that doesn’t always allow people of color the space to do so. The first track and first song written for the album, “Rise,” describes the healing process Knowles has been through in writing the album. Tracks such as “Weary,” “Cranes in the Sky” and “Mad” express the anger, grief and dissonance black women experience as a result of racism and prejudice. The burden of educating others is too often placed unfairly on people of color, who then find themselves tirelessly justifying their right to be angry. The R&amp;B singer criticizes the stereotype of the “angry black woman,” a term often used to invalidate women’s anger, in “Mad.” The track describes the songstress’s attempts to suppress her pain. In “Cranes in the Sky,” the singer grieves, “I tried to drink it away/I ran around in circles/but that just made me sadder.”</p>\n<p>The singer wrote on Instagram, “When I first started writing this record I was tired, filled with grief, and feeling broken … I wanted to tell my story, our story, in my own words, and in my own voice.” In “Don’t Touch My Hair,” Solange refuses to compromise her beliefs or her identity to satisfy others. She sets boundaries by telling white people who fetishize and alienate black women by non-consensually touching their hair to back off.</p>\n<p>The progression of the album continues. “Where do we go from here?” she asks in “Where Do We Go.” Master P answers this question in “Interlude: For Us By Us”: “If you don’t understand my record, you don’t understand me, so this is not for you.’” The interlude inspires Solange to begin to create a space for herself by allowing herself to rest. In “Borderline (An Ode to Self Care)”, she sings, “Baby, it’s war outside these walls/A safe place tonight/Let’s play it safe tonight.” Artists Nia Andrews and Kia Rowland go on to sing an acapella interlude, “I Got So Much Magic, You Can Have It,” that celebrates blackness. “Don’t let anybody steal your magic” is the defining rhetoric, both of this interlude and Solange’s journey.</p>\n<p>The album ends with a spoken-word interlude by Master P called “Closing: The Chosen Ones.” The final lyric, “Now, we come here as slaves, but we going out as royalty, and able to show that we are truly the chosen ones,” evokes regality. Solange has not only endured personal suffering, but identifies also with the suffering of all black people in America. At the conclusion of her journey, she recognizes herself and other people of color as the “chosen ones,” who deserve to be honored for their strength.</p>\n<p>Solange has created a beautiful and deeply personal album, rife with classic instrumentation and jazzy R&amp;B beats defined by her strong and clear voice. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is black excellence and black affirmation at its finest.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72937\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"193810748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72937\" data-attachment-id=\"72937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72937\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Warp\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Warp</p></div>\n<p><em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> by Ryan Hikes</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <em>Complex</em>, Danny Brown said that his artistic vision for his music is to “paint my own path and do something nobody else did because originality is everything to me.” Brown accomplishes this goal with his new full-length studio album <em>Atrocity Exhibition, </em>tackling the otherworldly, experimental beats all over this record that very few other rappers would even attempt to rap over.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, Brown returns to the more personal content of his breakout 2011 album <em>XXX</em> centered on his mental problems and drug use. However, <em>Atrocity Exhibition </em>does not simply celebrate drugs and partying, nor does it wholly condemn it. Instead, it portrays a person experiencing the highs and the lows of life. For example, the song “Get Hi,” which features a comedic hook by B-Real, seems at first to be an innocuous weed anthem. However, in the context of the album it amounts only to a temporary high, which may only lead to worsening depression akin to the “Downward Spiral” described in the first track. This song features unsettling guitars and industrial percussion that bring to life its hazy, eerie lyrics as Brown describes a depressive episode where he “feel like no one care, so I isolate myself and don’t go nowhere.” He then tries to quell this depression by “drowning [his] frustrations in an ocean of sin.” This is the tension of the album, as Brown seeks to relieve his pain, even though he knows it’s only pushing him further down this “Spiral.”</p>\n<p>This tension is realized in the instrumentals, as some of the best bangers of the year share a track list with some of the most soul-bearing raps since Kendrick Lamar’s <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. Incidentally, Kendrick features in one of the lead singles of the album, the posse cut “Really Doe,” along with Ab-Soul and Earl Sweatshirt. One of the highlights of the album, all four verses bring the energetic flow that makes a great posse cut, and it’s hard to pick a favorite feature, though Black Milk brings an excellent beat in his one production credit. Paul White, who is coming off a successful collaboration with Open Mike Eagle this year, remains on top of his game with a production credit on ten songs. A key standout from White is the sixth track, “Ain’t It Funny,” which features looping samples a muddy driving bass reminiscent of Grime music with high hornlike synths that create a creepy, funhouse beat. However, despite the exciting bangers of the album, the looming shadow of Brown’s depression remains in the background before being addressed with force on the final cut “Hell for It,” in which Brown reasserts control of his life by promising to keep fighting for his art despite his other problems. Ultimately, <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> does something quite remarkable among today’s hip-hop releases and remains cohesive in content, while tackling a variety of instrumentals that keep you interested throughout the 46-minute runtime of the record.</p>\n<p>Overall, this album is the perfect mix of unique artistry in the hip-hop medium: everything from the dark personal lyrics that present the highs and lows of a strained mental state to the eerie, experimental beats that seem to mesh perfectly with Brown’s unique yelping vocal delivery. <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> is the realization of Danny Brown’s desire to create something absolutely original and is one of the best hip-hop releases of the year.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72938\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2101037434\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72938\" data-attachment-id=\"72938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/banks/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Harvest\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harvest</p></div>\n<p><em>The Altar</em> by Malei Guzman</p>\n<p>Two years after the release of her debut album, singer-songwriter Jillian Rose Banks, better known as BANKS, released her sophomore album titled <em>The Altar.</em> The album was released at midnight on Sept. 30 2016.

The album touches many subjects, but the main theme that appears often is self-love and breakups.</p>\n<p>The song “To the Hilt” is a piano ballad about how hard it is to go through a breakup. It’s deep, it’s sad, it’s beautiful. Honestly,  listen to this song when you’re having feels.</p>\n<p>Her lead single, “Fuck with Myself,” is an anthem for everybody. It shows the beauty of loving yourself. BANKS herself has mentioned that this song can be interpreted in many ways. It has multiple meanings like, “I’m freaking awesome and I love myself,” or, “I don’t need anyone but myself!” It leaves one with the strong impression of, “I love myself because I am an awesome person, and if I’m the only one that can see that, it’s okay!”</p>\n<p>The song “Weaker Girl” also shows the strength within that comes with learning self-love. It’s a much slower song than “Fuck with Myself,” but it definitely shares the same message. The song explains the importance of loving yourself and surrounding yourself around people just like you. Being around people who share similar goals, interests and mindsets is a lot more important than one may think. The song is about a toxic relationship in which her boyfriend did not appreciate her for her greatness. He saw her as a toy; she was weak, and that gave him power. In the song she explains that she is not weak. She does not need someone who keeps brining her down; all she needs is herself and someone just as badass as her.</p>\n<p>In the song “Mother Earth,” we can hear the rawness of her voice. It’s soothing and it has a lot of true and powerful emotion to it. The song uses just a guitar for the instrumentals rather than her usual electronic, rap-inspired beats, which makes it great. We can hear her actual voice shine through, not one that is overpowered by the beat.</p>\n<p>Even though <em>The Altar</em> has a sound very similar to BANKS’s debut album <em>Goddess,</em> her sound on this album shows the improvement she has made with her voice. It shows how comfortable she has gotten over the years with her unique style of music.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Music Club will host Laura Marling, the star that set fire to the British Nu-Folk scene and danced in its flames. The singer-songwriter and musician launched her debut album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alas, I Cannot Swim, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the tender age of 18 and was propelled to the vanguard of the acoustic-folk revival that arose in the mid-2000s alongside indie-folk contemporaries such as Noah and the Whale and Mumford &amp; Sons. The 26-year-old has since received three Mercury Prize nominations for her first, second and fourth album, as well as the 2011 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist and nominations for the same award in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Hailed as one of the greatest folk artists of our era, Marling grew up in the limelight, though she has never grown accustomed or attached to it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notably private individual, Marling’s Delphian lyrics tiptoe toward meaning and confession, yet they rarely fail to stop just short. Her sound has naturally progressed through each of her albums, woven into ever more textured melodies. Her fourth album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I Was an Eagle,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gave way to a new stripped-back, minimalist approach: her guitar asserting its authority in the place of a band, her denuded vocals luxuriating in the space created by absence of instrumental drama. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I Was an Eagle</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been described as Marling’s quarter-life-crisis album, as well as one of the defining records of the 21st century. From her airy high notes to her low, melancholic warbles, Marling’s incredible versatility, insightful lyrics and penchant for storytelling have garnered awe from her audiences coast to coast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In 2012, Marling made a bid to escape the celebrity that smothered her earlier years and establish roots for herself. She packed up her Shoreditch apartment, sold her clothes and furniture and bought a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. Geographically and mentally removed from the cacophony of fame, her sojourn on the West Coast became a period of exploration, soul-searching and “a fairly odd, specific kind of transcendental yoga.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling’s most recent album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short Movie, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was completed upon her return to London in 2015 and marks a divergent path in her career towards a distinctive folk rock aesthetic. Marling’s father owned a recording studio, and she credits him with whittling her musical taste (that gears itself towards folk rock of the 1960s and ’70s). She describes his influence as “a blessing and a curse … I couldn’t slot myself into the age-appropriate genre.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling has said of her most recent album, “T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his record has a different heart.

Now I feel young again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An acoustic revival-come-folk darling with five critically acclaimed albums under her belt, Laura Marling is moving from strength to strength. This September, she embarked upon another road trip/solo tour of North-West America, embracing her status as a nomadic troubadour migrating from town to town. Your chance to be a part of her journey is this coming Friday at 7:30 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

most iconic anthems all eventually reach a point where a live performance is no longer possible. Perhaps that is what makes The Who at Santa Barbara Bowl such a special concert. The 51-year old English rock band comes to town Thursday night as a leg of what could very well be its final performance exhibition, titled, “Back to the Who Tour 51!”</p>\n<p>Any musical act that rocked the stage at Woodstock in 1969 is certainly worth witnessing live. A quick Google search of The Who’s “related artists” reveals a star-studded array, including The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, and just about any other 20th century powerhouse that will send your mom and dad’s nostalgia to the moon and back. With more than 100 million records sold worldwide, and hundreds of tribute bands attempting impersonations, The Who’s influence is undeniable.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s show will feature two of the original four members of the band, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. This is as authentic as a Who show can possibly get in 2016, as past members Keith Moon and John Entwistle are no longer living. As a lead singer, Daltrey has developed a famed reputation as one of rock’s most charismatic figures. Townshend has been cited as the driving force behind the songwriting successes of The Who, and is revered by other guitar gods such as Johnny Marr of The Smiths, who calls Townshend “the best of the ’60s guitar players by miles.” Both his master guitar playing and supporting vocals will be on display as he accompanies Daltrey’s frontman duties.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Some of The Who’s greatest hits include, “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” “My Generation” and “Baba O’Riley.” The first few bars of each of these songs will instantly send shockwaves of familiarity through your brain. Whether or not you recognize this music as The Who, you’ve undoubtedly heard at least one song from their repository of classics.</p>\n<p>In its prime, The Who’s influence was felt beyond music. The group’s adoption of the 1960s Modernism (“Mod”) aesthetic promoted London-based styles that infiltrated cultures around the world. The band also found itself at the epicenter of counter-culture influenced performance art, destroying instruments on stage in dramatic, theatrical fashion. The sheer possibility of a 71-year old Pete Townshend smashing a guitar against the Santa Barbara Bowl stage should be enough incentive for anyone to attend this show.</p>\n<p>So, whether or not you find yourself listening to The Who edition of “20th Century Masters: Greatest Hits,” the band’s mere presence in our city is worthy of note. With 50 plus years of experience under their belts, Daltrey and Townshend are sure to deliver a concert that will take a place in your memory for good.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6724,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6723,6722,6721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Iron & Wine: Mighty Fine","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13652982_10155081099833275_1380068762808936408_o.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13652982_10155081099833275_1380068762808936408_o.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“I don’t have a setlist,” the musician cooed lowly into the microphone...

The perennially bearded singer, clad in a velvet jacket, humbly welcomed the excitable applause from the audience, visibly excited to be in a new city. Almost every seat was filled of the sold-out show, and most seats were filled by non-student members of the community. The house lights were dimmed to almost nothing throughout the entire audience, and the stage lights cast a delicate glow on Beam’s face.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a setlist,” the musician cooed lowly into the microphone while putting on one of the guitars. He then welcomed requests, prompting polite shouts from the audience for music old and new. As familiar titles floated up to the stage, he nodded with a smile, finished tuning his guitar and began picking out a soft bass line. It was clear that he decided to begin with an acoustic, slow-tempo version of “Boy with a Coin,” a single from his 2007 album <em>The Shepherd’s Dog</em>. Faces were difficult to see in the audience, but the feeling in the room indicated a concentration on only what was happening onstage. There was no chatter amongst the many couples, and there were no phone screens alight.</p>\n<p>Every quiet moment brought about more song requests from the audience, and in a moment of being a fan and not a writer, I was happy to hear “Such Great Heights” being shouted aloud, a personal favorite. It is a gentle cover of a track by The Postal Service, featured in the movie “Garden State,<em>”</em> the soundtrack for which brought a handful of indie artists to the mainstream during the early 2000s, including Iron &amp; Wine. Staying aligned with his folk roots, Beam himself has developed his own style of gentle fingerpicking over the years, thickening the sound by slapping the side of his hand against the body of the guitar for a sort of makeshift percussion. His charming mix of a southern drawl delivering worldly wit matched the crowd, creating a strong sense of both comfort and intimacy that settled over the room.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>‘The Iron &amp; Wine Buffet Show,” the lone singer jokingly christened the night, keeping the entire show open to audience suggestions. Only debuting two newer songs, this night was, of course, meant to please longtime listeners. “Tree By the River,” a fan favorite performed at almost every Iron &amp; Wine show, was the next request fulfilled. It is just one of many songs that showcase Beam’s skill for crafting effortlessly spun tales of front porch, lazy sun love. His voice covered the hall like velvet, almost identical to the rich softness of his recordings.</p>\n<p>Graciously exiting the stage, Beam left the audience giving him a standing ovation, calling out for more. He obliged, thanked the audience once more, and slowly began his encore song, “The Trapeze Swinger,” a nine-minute indie-folk opus from his 2009 compilation <em>Around the Well</em>. He promised to fulfill the requests not acknowledged during the show another time, seeming to make a roundabout promise to return to the city soon.</p>\n<p>“It was a mellow, emotional set, but definitely captivating for the whole audience,” Galen McDougal, a Santa Barbara local, said, presumably echoing the sentiments of the entire audience.</p>\n<p>The set was nearly two hours long, which is lengthy by most standards, but “he could have just kept playing tonight and that would have been amazing,” Lauren Perry, a Santa Barbara local, said. The gentle sounds of Iron &amp; Wine beautifully ushered in the Arts &amp; Lectures season, and the fall season itself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Storke Plaza. One student was heard yelling, “Hurry up before we miss Underbelly!” in a desperate attempt to get his slow friends to hustle. The energy was palpable Saturday night as students hurried to AS Program Board’s Welcome Back Concert, eager to dance up a sweat to the trap beats of EDM group Keys N Krates.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the show was UCSB’s own Underbelly. The hip-hop DJ, a student on campus, is a staple among local music. The opener has gained a following in the community both as a solo performer and as part of Azeem X Underbelly, a his collaboration with UCSB’s most famous flutist alumnus, Azeem Ward. (You can see their <em>Nexus</em> Batcave session here: <em>dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-batcave-sessions-season-premiere/.</em>) The DJ did not disappoint, building up the crowd’s energy with his catchy beats and enthusiastic dance moves. His samples of hits, including Nicki Minaj’s “Feeling Myself” and “Bees in the Trap” had the audience singing right along with the recording, keeping the mood light and fun as students eagerly awaited the arrival of the night’s main act.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72684\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72684\" data-attachment-id=\"72684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/keys-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"keys-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72684 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With Underbelly’s set coming to a close and setup beginning for the next set, echoes of “Nice to meet you!” and “Did you lose your friends, too?” floated through the crowd. More and more students — many of them brand new freshmen from the sounds of it — filled Storke Plaza. The Welcome Back Concert proved to be as much a social event as it was a live show, giving new and unfamiliar students a chance to get to know some of the names and faces that will be alongside them for the next four years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just as the crowd was getting antsy from waiting — idle chit-chat and nervous small talk fading into the background — a blaring boom from the speakers set the audience alight with cheers, signaling the entrance of the main act, trap trio Keys N Krates. The Toronto natives opened their set with infectious clapping beats that concertgoers — even if they ended up a little off rhythm — did their best to match.</p>\n<p>The trap group — consisting of keyboardist David Matisse, drummer Adam Tune and Jr. Flo on the turntables — made what could have been a lot of uncomfortable swaying and standing around a solid dance party. The crowd drew in close as the set got going, eager to get as close to the stage as possible. The performance was marked with hard-hitting beats and satisfying drops, practically daring the audience to find a way not to dance along. Playing a combination of original samples and well recognized tunes, the trio delivered with crowd favorites such as Travis Scott’s “Antidote” (played appropriately “at the night show”), as well as one of the group’s most popular original tracks, the guaranteed-to-get-stuck-in-your-head “Dum Dee Dum,” both of which garnered loud cheers and smooth moves from the crowd (as well as a, “Please tell me I didn’t miss ‘Dum Dee Dum’ ’cause that’s what I came to see!” from a girl standing nearby).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72685\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72685\" data-attachment-id=\"72685\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/beating-festival-fomo-8-new-events-selling-overpriced-day-passes/keys-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"keys-by-jenny-luo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72685 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the set began winding down to a close, the crowd gradually thinned out with those remaining focusing less on recognizing familiar songs and more on finding a beat to dance to. Although the EDM group brought a fun experience, toward the end of the performance, the familiar pattern of claps and then drops grew repetitive, verging on losing the audience’s attention.
