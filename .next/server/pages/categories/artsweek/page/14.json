Had you talked to me just two short weeks ago, I would have said that the only word that comes to mind when I hear “Coachella” is “overrated.” But alas, having attended my first Coachella this April, my sentiments for the festival have taken a tentative 180.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Previously, I maintained that Coachella was for aspiring insta-models and white people who think they aren’t. Rather, I thought it was for the basic. Having attended other festivals with varying reputations like Lightning in a Bottle, FYF and Outside Lands, I concluded ignorantly that Coachella was for squares and that the people who make up the crowd are comparatively less vibey, mindful, woke or delightful than the refined and intellectual crowds that LiB, FYF and OSL attract. I was pleasantly mistaken.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Put simply, Coachella is the mack-daddy of all festivals. It does it big. The sheer production quality alone is reason enough to attend. What Coachella does that other festivals fail to is flush tons of funds into every single minute detail of the festival. They really do have a commitment to the festival attendees, and it shows. It’s not just a sham intent on exploiting a large gathering of affluent people. Everything caters to the pure enjoyment of the attendees and there’s something exquisite at every turn.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My first and primary concern prior to attendance was the demographic that Coachella attracts. Fellow festival goers can make or break a festival experience, and I wrongfully assumed that Coachella would attract a crowd that goes to festivals for all the wrong reasons. I expected that Coachella would be filled with pretentious, self-absorbed Instagram models seeking to bleed the festival grounds dry of every insta-worthy background. And while there are ample apparent models and ~influencers~ prancing about the festival grounds, there is also an equal counterweight. There are happy people who simply want to have fun and listen to dank music.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I was blissfully confronted with a sea of smiling faces and good-natured people equally as eager to see their favorite artists perform. People were not rude, I wasn’t pushed or battered, and I met wonderful humans at every stage. Coachella, you win this one. Rather than the pompous crowd I expected, I came across creative and fun-loving people who share the same interests as me. There’s no denying that the festival doubles as a quasi fashion show. Attendees don their gayest apparel and strut around in all of the glittery garb they own. But this is only one element to the festival. I learned to embrace the fashion as part of the Coachella experience and to appreciate the artfully crafted outfits that people put together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The demographic was mainly 20-somethings, but I was also taken aback by the number of plausible moms and dads in attendance. Turns out even old people like cutting-edge performances from prodigious artists.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Furthermore, Coachella offers some of the better people-watching scenarios I’ve encountered in my 21 years. It trumps that of the Orange County Fair and the Paris metro combined. It’s such a physically beautiful crowd, too. It’s actually strange seeing so many attractive people in one place. I’m pretty sure all the objectively good-looking people on the planet were at Coachella Weekend one.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another concern I had with Coachella prior to attending was the music itself. I feared that the hundreds of dollars I invested in my experience would be put to waste. At a glance, the lineup didn’t seriously excite me, and I feared I would be forced to watch performances from people who make up for in notoriety what they lack in talent. Yet again, I was proven wrong.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Within 10 minutes of my attendance at the festival, the internet-famous yodeling boy was on stage. I was both utterly shocked and not surprised at all.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Coachella has something for everyone. Unlike other festivals, it does not pinhole itself by branding itself as a genre-specific festival. The breadth of its annual lineups continue to become increasingly polar. They pair rock artists with racy hip-hop performers and put Vance Joy on the same stage as Cardi B. The only boundary that Coachella consistently enforces is that there will be A-list artists. Again, they do it big.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tyler, the Creator has a very niche fanbase. His paramount talent does not transcend the fact that he’s not everybody’s cup of tea. He’s abrasive and unpredictable and I felt that Coachella was just not his vibe. Coachella encapsulates all of the things Tyler isn’t: white kids doing drugs they bought with their parents’ money and wearing clothing made by designers whose names they can’t pronounce. Instagram photo shoots, recording of performances, trying to outdo everyone around you on the most superficial level. His performance didn’t garner the attention it deserved and the lack of energy in the crowd was noticeable. A word of advice? Stick to Flog Gnaw, Tyler.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Odesza delivered wizardry to my eyeballs. The American electronic duo employed unprecedented tactics to amaze and entertain the audience, and it worked. Hundreds of drones filled the sky with light in what looked like a continuation of floating paper lanterns up from the screen. These drones continued to beam and shift until they formed the duo’s symbol in the sky. I personally found it was quite rude of the artists to place such an impressive distraction in the middle of their set. I couldn’t focus on the performance because I was in a continuous state of utter awe. Their set was beautiful and ethereal. It made me cry, made me smile, made me drop it like it was hot and made me bang on my own set of pretend drums. For a DJ duo with an image that is far from badass, they delivered in the area of badass-ness.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s so much more than a competition of who can compile the most rhinestone-clad articles of clothing in one ensemble.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year’s Coachella lineup was particularly EDM-heavy. This could be reflective of a broader trend toward a favoring of the synthetic sound. The electro lineup included DJs ranging from king of night bass AC Slater to the celestial Odesza and featured most everything in between. I broke my neck at Troyboi’s trap-heavy set and womped in the Do Lab to my heart’s content.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Do Lab is where I would like to live when I grow up. It’s the place where DJs are always firing and drunk girls somehow make their way on stage and shoot giant water blasters that they shouldn’t be legally permitted to operate. The Do Lab is where funk intersects groove, and it all happens under a billowy covering of magnificent colorful tarps. It’s always popping off, always there for you in your time of need.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, let’s talk headliners. The Weeknd headlined the first night of the festival. He performed banger after banger, and I appreciated that. He sang beautifully and exposed his talent in a nonchalant manner, opting for a more understated performance than his headlining counterparts. His performance was a great way to close the first day and kick off the festival.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Saturday, Beyoncé delivered a performance that was as earth-shattering as just about everything else she does. She served up what resembled more of a full-length concert than a festival performance. Throughout the entirety of the two hour performance all I could think about as I stared at her perfectly perky ass was that she popped three children out. Damn.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Her performance was filled with empowering nods to black culture and tasteful allusions to gender inequality. She elegantly and artfully made paramount social commentary all while strutting her shit and making it appear effortless in that true Beyoncé fashion. She closed her performance by humbly thanking the audience for allowing her to be the first black woman to headline Coachella, reminding us that she is somehow still a human.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For Coachella’s closing headliner, Eminem, I stood in the crowd by myself, barefoot, content, wiggling my toes in the grass and munching on a churro. But from Eminem, I wanted more. His performance got off to a peculiar start as red, white and blue fireworks shot into the sky and images of the American flag filled the jumbotrons. To these images he performed the song “White America,” and I found this to be a strange choice for the audience he was performing to. Out of all of his arsenal of hits to perform, and keeping in mind that headlining Coachella is one of the biggest performances of any artist’s career, I thought it a strange choice to include a song that mocks the very crowd of people he was performing to. From Eminem, I wanted more hits and less political commentary from a white dude.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Festivals aren’t solely about music, however. Coachella is also famous for its featured art and grandiose decor. This year the art did not disappoint. After two days of substance-clouded festival-ing I decided I was ready to experience Coachella in totality (or rather, sober). I actually had no choice as I had quickly reached my body’s breaking point.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My voice was nowhere to be found, the dirt underneath my fingernails became part of my ‘chella aesthetic and the blisters on my feet were so massive they deserved their own Instagram accounts. Not to mention my liver, brain, cardiovascular system and overall sense of reality were begging for sobriety.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I spent the remaining sober leg of my Coachella experience by myself, exploring the festival grounds, admiring the beautiful art and meeting fellow festival goers in passing. I stumbled upon a structure that I had passed a handful of times throughout the course of the weekend but never truly looked at. It was a striking, chrome, spaceship-looking piece titled “Lodestar” </span><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small;\">— </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">and it was stunning. I walked around the structure for 45 minutes, admiring its form and delving into its intricacies. It was in that moment that it dawned on me: this is what Coachella is all about. Sure, it’s everything it appears to be at face value: the music, the clothes, the star-studded surprise performances and the cliche ferris wheel pictures. But it’s also this beautiful conglomeration of accidental and intentional hidden gems.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, you can take this all with a grain of salt. Yes, all the surface assumptions about the festival do hold true. It is utilized as an excuse for people to show-off their finest festival attire and to potentially snap a selfie with a celeb. But Coachella is much more than the blog-o-sphere’s favorite festival. It is a gathering of artists, music and art lovers, fun seekers and colorful people who unite over a common love for the good stuff. It is overwhelmingly crowded, hot and loud, but it is also overwhelmingly merry, whimsical and spectacular.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sheer grandeur of the festival is what makes it worthwhile and what keeps convincing 100,000+ people to attend every year.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

is that it avoids being crushed under the gargantuan weight of its own canon — seriously, just imagine the production costs of the last eighteen movies weighed in gold bullion. You have ten years’ worth of movie characters stuffed into two and a half hours, and somehow it managed not to suck!</p>\n<p>This movie’s storyline has been building up in bits and pieces since the 2012 Avengers film, but we’ve all gotten the gist by now: Thanos wants to collect a bunch of super-powered rocks that will give him ultimate power, and the Avengers, with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy, gotta stop him. But after two “Avengers” movies and “Civil War,” the novelty of huge crossover movies has worn itself out, and not being awful shouldn’t be one of this movie’s main points of praise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So why does it feel like it is? I think it’s because there’s very little “Infinity War” does exceptionally well at. We’ve seen witty banter among a big cast of characters already. We’ve seen giant, sprawling battles of people fighting various CGI abominations. We’ve seen fights between fan-favorite characters. In a vague sense, we’ve seen “Infinity War” before, and it doesn’t do anything particularly special to make itself stand out against its predecessors.</p>\n<p>But it’s not bad. Nope, not at all. It’s fun and funny. It’s a good time. Stuff goes boom, characters crack jokes. Yes, it’s fun to see the Avengers interact with the Guardians of the Galaxy, which at least adds a new dynamic of crossover that we haven’t seen since the first “Avengers.”</p>\n<p>Narrative-wise, I also feel like “Infinity War” <em>is</em> a major step up from “Age of Ultron<em>.</em>” Which is sort of like saying that a bottled cabernet is a step up from bagged wine, but at least this movie at least concludes Thanos’s overall arc that Joss Whedon kicked off back in 2012 and saw fit to remind us of three years later in an otherwise mediocre movie.</p>\n<p>And while I’m on the topic of the latest motion-capture baddie, let me address him. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is another notable Marvel villain improvement, a fantastical realization of badditude right off the heels of the more grounded Killmonger. I wouldn’t say Brolin’s character has a fully fleshed-out personality, but he does at least have more than two emotions and complicated motivations. I don’t remember where, but I read somewhere once that the best villains are the one with sympathetic goals.</p>\n<p>Thanos’s objective is not at all good, but not wholly unsympathetic, either. He wants to use the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe to combat overpopulation. He truly believes himself to be working for the greater good, and since his methods have yielded positive results (at least, so he claims), it is impossible to dismiss his tactics completely. Although I question whether or not Thanos has considered creating more food and/or planets to better solve the problem. You have power over all space and time — there have to be more humane options you can conjure than vaporizing half of everything.</p>\n<p>Thinking about it, Thanos may just be the major point of praise that this film is deserving of. Now that he is finally taking an active role in the plot instead of sitting behind the scenes like a buff bogeyman, he gets to show off just what makes him the most-feared bad guy in the galaxy and why Loki shivers at the thought of him.</p>\n<p>One complaint I’ve seen circulating around the Internet that amuses me is the notion that this film will be impossible for those who have not seen the prior films. Well, yes. That’s sort of the point of a sequel and/or crossover. Being upset about that is like complaining that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” did not go out of its way to explain who Harry, Ron and Hermione are and what they’re doing. If you don’t know what’s going on, watch the other movies. It’s certainly not as troublesome as loudly asking the kid sitting next to you who every character in the movie is. I’m looking at you, girl and her dad/uncle/grandpa/nondescript older male relation sitting two seats down from me at the theater.</p>\n<p>If I do have any genuine complaints, it’s the ending. The last two minutes before the credits roll just feel…weightless. But it’s not necessarily the movie’s fault; rather, it’s the fact that I can’t go anywhere on the Internet without seeing the casting info for “Avengers 4.” If I know who’s coming back for the next one, that pretty much kills any tension this movie’s trying to set up.</p>\n<p>But, y’know what? So what. That’s just a quibble. If you want to have fun for two and a half hours, this is what you want to see. I’m not particularly sentimental about the MCU — at least, not as much as that person I saw on Twitter who fainted after seeing the movie — but I know damn good popcorn entertainment when I see it. The film critic in me is disappointed that I wasn’t wowed, but the average filmgoer part enjoyed himself. “Infinity War” is a movie that shouldn’t have worked, but it did, and it’s fun.</p>\n<p>Good enough, I say. Just not great.</p>\n<p><em>We’re not sure if Wehrung has impossibly high standards or if he’s just a sourpuss.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Isla Vista, you now and again need a musical change of pace. The occasional backyard concert can often give you a solid alternative fix, but eventually, after one too many Red Hot Chili Peppers covers, you’ll probably need to hit the road for some refreshing higher quality tunes. If you were feeling this way last Wednesday, the game plan was then, of course, to head to SOhO and violently mosh to SadGirl and The Drums until physically impossible. I personally opted to choose this option last week, and, as the sea of drunken sweaty bodies around me could attest, it was a great call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums and other indie, surf-rock bands of the same nature have a general reputation for this kind of silly debauchery in the live setting. Last Wednesday was no different in SOhO’s smaller intimate space. The crowd looked like a typical Observatory OC or Burger Records type demographic, mainly LA-inspired college kids with a hint of hip older fans peppered in. My friends and I luckily cruised in just in time for a very pleasant surprise to start the night, the captivating and energetic performance from opener SadGirl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SadGirl’s set was refreshing and clean to a point where I felt rude and inferior in comparison to the rest of the crowd for not knowing who they were earlier. With a vibe very reminiscent of The Drums’ lo-fi aesthetic, they primed the stage perfectly for the rest of the night. Their simple, three-man lineup of guitar, drums and bass easily filled the room with indie sounds that did not fail to give the crowd a great time. This band shows a ton of potential to me be a landmark band in the indie scene, much like The Growlers, Twin Peaks and of course, The Drums are today. It was a pleasure to catch such a likeable and promising act early, especially given that I had previously known nothing about what was to come. A few moshes and subtle layers of sweat later, and the whole crowd and myself were ready for the chaotic follow up of The Drums.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums were, as the headline may allude, everything I expected and more. It was so simultaneously beautiful and hectic that it personally left me at a sensory crossroad that I haven’t felt in a long time, probably only comparable to Nine Inch Nails’ iconic comeback set at FYF 2017. The term “organized chaos,” although played out, immediately comes to mind when looking back, as the juxtaposition of the crazy violent moshing crowd and the elegant, crisp, and well rehearsed performance on stage weirdly enough worked perfectly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They came out to a classic track from their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “What You Were,” starting the set off strong and recognizing their long term, dedicated fans. As you have probably figured out by now, the audience was insane, pushing and moving and dancing like a bomb was just dropped on the crowd. I know this is being described excessively, but looking back, this excessiveness is extremely necessary — given how much god damn fun this show really was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s stage presence was impeccable, as the beautiful light display provided a vibrant and encapsulating silhouette for lead singer Jonny Pierce’s elegant dancing around the microphone. The instrumentation was as clean as ever, with every cue followed perfectly and every transition executed excellently. This band is no stranger to the live setting, and even a between Coachella stop at SOhO was performed with the highest precision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums followed up their opener with familiar jams “Days” and “Money” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and “Hart Basel” from their most recent 2017 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abysmal Thoughts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The set featured a good mix of old and new hits, all of which flowed seamlessly, considering the cohesive and consistent discography of the band. The set featured a wide array of The Drums’ discography, but generally favored their more recent work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band wrapped up with their newest single, and possibly biggest and most powerful track, “Blood Under My Belt,” before leaving the stage briefly before an encore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierce’s crooning words “I still love you, I love you, I still do,” hit much harder in the live setting, providing a backdrop for one of the most gorgeous mosh pits I have ever personally witnessed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the crowd chanted excitedly for a return for one more song, the band came back out to end the night with another Drums’ classic “Down By the Water,” dating back all the way to their 2010 self-titled debut album. This last song choice seemed perfect in the moment, as a nod back to their roots in an intimate and a slowed down moment of meditation with their supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love indie rock, and I greatly appreciate The Drums and their influence in modern music, but I don’t often get to have live experiences quite like this one. Last Wednesday at SOhO was such a great change of pace — so gorgeous, so hectic, and so much fun. Nights like these show that not every concert experience has to be monumental or some life changing experience, but instead, can just be a really kickass time. The Drums gave downtown Santa Barbara a brilliantly wild escape from home, as I hope they continue to give people for many years to come. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As for someone such as Jane Gottlieb,  a simple photograph will not suffice, seeing as she takes further steps in order to intensify the result. On Thursday evening, April 26, the walls of the AD&amp;A Museum at UCSB were wrapped in some of the glorious works crafted by the hands of Gottlieb as she stood amongst peers, family and students in preparation to give her lecture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the discussion many questions arose from those in attendance seeing as her work sparks much curiosity. Unlike many photographs, Gottlieb’s exemplifies some of the complexities of photo taking. Her art is saturated with illuminating colors which pop at first glance. The eccentricity of such radiant elements serve to be symbolic of the emotions which surge through the moments which she captures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fusion of colors which represent deep sentiments, Gottlieb pushes to draw more attention to them. Gottlieb further explained how one of her pieces is a manifestation of these concepts. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist said to the crowd, “This is me trying to recreate the energy which you get when looking down from the Eiffel Tower, which isn’t there, positive energy really.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such an idea can come across as being very unusual but Gottlieb does well in proving through her work how the intricacy of adding her unique modifications polish the vision which she has. In her piece titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eiffel Tower at Dawn, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gottlieb takes an abstract approach where she embedded patterns behind the monumental Eiffel Tower which, in a sense, embody the breathtaking feeling of such a phenomenal view. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Gottlieb explained how the power of using a software such as photoshop allows her to create variations of the same piece.

She shared how for a long period of time she was originally interested in painting and then her passion strayed more towards photography. Her roots in painting are what elicited some of the first pieces Gottlieb created where she would use retouching dye on top of actual printed pieces.

dream and put something into my voice notes for later.” She shared how her creativity sparks in the some of the most profound areas like while she is “in water” taking a bath or “in the air” on plane rides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these scenarios, that not only work to symbolize the way her music tends to make listeners feel, serve to show how her life has changed from once living in a car at the age of 17 to now the glowing lavishness which is at the forefront of her lifestyle. Uchis has released her highly anticipated full-length project titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and on it she takes on the task of establishing her versatility and ability to embed a variety of sounds into one album.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uchis carries a nimble, soft spoken persona, but what she does not say in interviews resonates loudly through her music. On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s opening track, “Body Language (Intro),” she explores the intimacy of a tropical jazz, invoking the daydream state which lingers through a day on the beach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uchis’ lush voice pierces through the sensuality of the opener as she urges listeners to minimize the distance, singing “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just come closer, closer, closer, closer, closer/(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanna know who you are</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)” and so, she invites us to explore the emotions which she has kept in confinement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What separates Uchis’ unique sound is the way she embraces her Colombian roots in a majority of her songs. This is prevalent in singles off the album such as “Nuestro Planeta” or “Tyrant,” in which artist like Reykon and Jorja Smith accompany Uchis over poppy rhythms that are reminiscent of reggaeton, which serve as backdrops to the dance music. Not only does she shine a light in a way which raises her cultural awareness but Uchis uses </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost as a soundtrack which excels in unveiling the scenes of her life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With “Miami,” Uchis  taps into the April March sound which is evocative of her appreciation for Quentin Tarantino’s Western induced sounds and she meshes it with synth-speckled instrumentals. Uchis’ magnificent storytelling gives one a glance into her movielike lifestyle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In My Dreams” sounds like the kind of quirky song cued to play at a dance in the ’80s. The low-tempo romance serenade, “Flight 22,” could play at the eye-to-eye, love at first glance moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bona fide collaborations on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make for indubitably stellar alliances. “Just A Stranger” is the type of combination which takes two profuse vocalists and makes for a rich, funky track. Steve Lacy compliments Uchis in a perfect way as the two sing the money over love ballad and is a standout production by BROCKHAMPTON’S Romil. “Tomorrow” channels the R&amp;B psychedelia which Uchis’ is fondly known for and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker is magnificent at the control panel guiding the singer through the toxic swirl which is his production. Although titled</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isolation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Uchis does well in reaching out for direction from immaculate contributors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the number of partnerships made throughout the album they only serve to showcase Uchis’. Uchis is empowering on her lonesome and swiftly glides through the clear waves of instrumentation which she rides eloquently. “Your Teeth In My Neck” exemplifies Uchis’ ability to utilize up-tempo orchestration. On “Feel Like A Fool” she demonstrates a vintage sound which triggers nostalgia to the doo-wop sound which could sneak its way into compilation of Motown classics. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">captures Kali Uchis’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relentless ability to venture into an amalgamation of different musical domains. With Uchis, it is difficult to pinpoint with what sound she finds the most success. Nonetheless, it is not an overbearing element on her behalf, but rather, it showcases her talents. Similar to a film soundtrack, this project gathers a variety of songs which can be implemented for an abundance of feelings. There is no one single type of sound, yet the cohesiveness remains intricate. For whatever situation that comes in Uchis’ path, this protagonist proves to be at the center of the spotlight in each moment.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“American Guilt” plays thematically to the album title, referencing the stereotype of Americans as glutinous, hedonistic and overindulgent (in terms of both sex and food).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening lyrics of the song, “Tape over the camera / No more utopian video,” seem to reference the intense paranoia of our own government, specifically the tendency to cover webcams with tape. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though heavy with electric guitar riffs, upon closer inspection the song appears to be one of the simpler of the album </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lacking the synthetic embellishment that has become synonymous with UMO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably the best song on the album, “Not in Love We’re Just High” offers a reflective take on a drug-induced infatuation. With an abrupt transition from a clamor of noises to a hypnotic blend of synths and an infectious beat, the song fits well with UMO’s entire body of work, but stands apart from songs that blend into a ubiquitous fusion of lo-fi psychedelic indie rock. Nielson is truly putting his best foot forward with “Not in Love We’re Just High,” offering a playful yet introspective view of the intertwining nature of drugs, lust and love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone Acts Crazy Nowadays” serves as one of the most direct critiques of human nature, particularly the overwhelming sense of dread felt on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commenting that “Everyone acts crazy now / But we are taking all kinds of shit,” the frantic nature of the lyrics are highlighted by an upbeat tune that hints at a disco influence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaking from his usual implementation of interesting, borderline annoying noises and dynamic layering of synthetic sounds, Nielson included multiple tracks that primarily featured a stripped down guitar. The use of acoustics was especially noteworthy on the melodic “This Doomsday” in which Nielson juxtaposed the heavy subject matter with the lullaby-esque nature of the instrumentals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Internet of Love (That Way)”  allows Nielson’s voice do most of the heavy lifting, proving that the band’s trademark production is not simply a crutch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delving into the subject of finding love online, Nielson mournfully sings, “I woke up alone / Did you wake up with someone else / Only you could love me / Only you could love me / That way.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An obvious outlier on the album is “Hunnybee,” a song which Nielson revealed he wrote with his young daughter as a source of inspiration. Citing it as a “platonic love song,” “Hunnybee” stands out with its tender and delicate lyrics that seem out of place in a typical UMO album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reminiscent of “The World is Crowded” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-Love</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “Hunnybee” mimics the frequent yet poignant repetition of lyrics, “Hunnybee, hunnybee / There’s no such thing / A sweeter a sting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Nielson repeats the lyrics 12 times over the course of the song, they do not lose their meaning, but instead become an increasingly powerful reminder that there are glimmers of hope left in our world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex &amp; Food</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may not be Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s best collective work, it does offer an innovative look at the modern day and age. Certainly an impressive effort, the album serves as an ambitious holistic view of society while pushing the boundaries of their musical niche. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Think about how the music made you feel upon first listen and how those sounds have resonated in some form or another as time has elapsed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in conjunction with recollections of the music enclosed within your favorite records, you also recalled the artwork which represents these collections of sound. From the Beatles’ <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, to The Velvet Underground’s <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em>, all great albums exist behind their respective artwork.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Dewey Bryan Saunders, one of today’s most innovative and established graphic designers who often operates within the niche realm that is cover art. Working alongside figures such as Anderson .Paak, Lil Uzi Vert and Chronixx, Saunders has been steadily navigating through the art world with consistent and captivating work for years now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up with interests rooted in music and skateboarding, Saunders was always attracted to art. He was an underground hip hop head who frequented local shows in Philadelphia, deejayed in his friend’s basement and collected vinyl records.</p>\n<p>“I feel like art, music and skateboarding all arise from the same place for me — stoned teenager watching skate videos, doing art, freestyling,” Saunders said. “I cut out all the ads from Transworld and Thrasher around my room and started seeing that I was attracted to graphic design without even knowing the term ‘graphic design.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82699\" style=\"width: 1204px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"730390254\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82699\" data-attachment-id=\"82699\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/01-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=1194%2C972&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1194,972\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=888%2C723&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82699\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=888%2C723\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"723\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=768%2C625&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=1024%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>While studying illustration and graphic design at Tyler School of Art, Saunders ultimately settled on hand-cut collage work. His style is simultaneously classic and modern; hand-cut items from vintage sources such as old National Geographic or Playboy magazines are reworked into an iconically distinct visual concoction.</p>\n<p>The creative didn’t stop studying art after college, however. Saunders is constantly refining his craft and developing a better eye for the nuanced detail that is so integral to his artwork.</p>\n<p>His day-to-day routine typically consists of early caffeinated mornings of reading and design.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been trying to read a lot more lately to keep the mind sharp and to inform concepts in my art practice,” he said.</p>\n<p>Saunders recently made a move from Philadelphia, Pa. to Los Angeles, Calif.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the main difference about living on the west coast is my access to different sorts of source material. I order some things from the internet, but I love the old fashioned dig for good materials, and there are so many weekend flea markets and bookstores, I’ve been able to rapidly expand my printed matter collection,” he explained.</p>\n<p>While based in Philadelphia, Saunders began designing cover art for local musicians. One of his formative projects was in collaboration with a local indie band called Brown Recluse. From there, he continued to work with other artists and slowly built his portfolio.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82701\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"661672428\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82701\" data-attachment-id=\"82701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/dbs-sp4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=2048%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DBS SP4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=888%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-82701 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=888%2C238\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=768%2C206&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=1024%2C275&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>While you may not be familiar with Saunders, you’ve likely come across his artwork at some point. One of his most notable ventures was with rapper/singer/songwriter Anderson .Paak.</p>\n<p>Saunders connected with .Paak through Twitter. At the time, he was making portraits of rappers on Instagram and tagging them in his posts. Some of these portraits were even reposted by artists like Drake and Mac Miller. Nonetheless, .Paak eventually reached out to Saunders after stumbling upon artwork of some of his hip hop contemporaries. This relationship later blossomed into a poster series for a handful of .Paak’s concerts, then cover art for singles and albums.</p>\n<p>For <em>Malibu</em>, the musician’s sophomore LP behind the moniker “Anderson .Paak,” Saunders worked under the creative direction of designer Cory Gomberg. Together, the two teamed up to conceptualize the sounds of the critically acclaimed record into a visual manifestation of .Paak’s aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The cover art for <em>Malibu</em> is fascinating. The intricacies enveloped within the 1×1 picture are both chaotic and organized. Saturated in orange sunlight, Anderson .Paak sits at a glossy upright piano as foamy swells of ocean water and an assortment of miscellaneous items float around him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82700\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"916128855\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82700\" data-attachment-id=\"82700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/ap_malibu_cover_flat_ap_web-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82700\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cover art for Anderson .Paak’s album <em>Malibu</em>, Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>But, it would be a crime to think of Saunders only through the lens of his cover art. The creator is much more than that — he’s an artistic powerhouse who maintains ties to a ubiquity of creative spaces. Saunders is an illustrator, a designer, sometimes a musician. He releases artwork on social media sites daily and connects with his fans and supporters online. Saunders is undoubtedly the most active, accessible and engaging artist on social media I have ever encountered.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it is refreshing for people to know that I am a real person and by being super consistent and responsive, it makes people trust me as a brand,” Saunders said. “I like to have people kind of follow along my activities too, and it’s even good for family that lives all around the country that wants to know what I’ve been up to recently.”</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that the artist’s success didn’t evolve overnight. Saunders grew up in an age without Instagram. He promoted his craft by hand, mailing out flyers and samples of his work to anybody he could reach. Analogously, he’s had to make some sacrifices along the way.</p>\n<p>“I think sticking to a freelance lifestyle and taking a long time to develop a personal style was a bit of a sacrifice. Eventually that route worked out for me, but it was a long journey to where I am now and it still feels like the beginning,” Saunders elaborated. “I am really fortunate to be in the position of a graphic designer with a personal style that is desirable right now, and it was a tremendous amount of work — a supernatural effort to reach this level.”</p>\n<p>Saunders slices printed source material the same way a hip hop producer would sample a song.

The Man brought the festival atmosphere without the dusty desert air and notorious outfits to the Santa Barbara Bowl last Saturday, alongside soul-influenced performers, Chicano Batman.</p>\n<p>Strutting along the stage, clad in tuxedos and Vans Old Skools, Chicano Batman’s guitar riffs rippled throughout the crowd. A liberating sensibility dared the general admission floor to dance as if they were at Coachella, moving in free-form along to the groove. Dripping in the highest tuxedo fashion, Chicano Batman prove their eclectic authenticity by tapping into the golden era of soul music and the emotional ballads symbolic of Spanish music.</p>\n<p>The group have already carved a name for themselves as must-see festival stunners with their 2017 Tropicalia performance and through gracing the Coachella stage multiple times. The Los Angeles four-piece played whimsical songs such as “Black Lipstick” and “Magma,” which both channel elements of 50s blues percussion. When the band seamlessly transitioned into “Freedom is Free,” the crowd waved their hands and twirled around to the rhythm as if they were Penny Lane in “Almost Famous.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite Chicano Batman bringing their immersive, delightful tunes to the SB Bowl, they also brought political and social problems to the foreground with their enlightening lyrics.

Despite their lack of interaction with the crowd, the screen depicting everything from colorful animations of faces to odes to Portland behind the band forewarned the audience that “We are not very good at stage banter, so our manager wrote some stuff on the screen to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>The Portland-based band’s tinge of sarcastic humor and honesty was also apparent when they projected the subtitles, “If you’re here for ODESZA, you’re early,” on the screen of their Sunday afternoon Coachella set. Most of the festival crowd happens to not be interested in the lengths of synth rock music, yet the band rocked out the eager Santa Barbara Bowl crowd with groovy explorations of their latest project.</p>\n<p>The riveting performance of “Keep On” raptured the crowd, as the dosage of rock intermingled with the rotating neon lights that were either bound to cause a mild optical migraine or lead the audience into a psychedelic trip.</p>\n<p>The tight-knit band seems to have a compatible link with each other where they communicate by mere instrumentals. Guitarist Eric Howk, fueled the band’s primary power riffs all the while he was in his wheelchair. Meanwhile, John Gourley is zoned in a trance of giving the crowd a variety of vocal changes, and Jason Sechrist provides the tempo changes through his fluid drum changes. Kyle O’Quin heavily focuses on the synthesizers as if they are a lifeline, Zoe Manville offered her delicate falsetto to illuminate hard-hitting tracks and bassist Zach Carothers emphasized the vein of rock running through the band’s catalog.</p>\n<p>Summer of 2017 marked Portugal. The Man’s release of the intoxicating medley of soul, rock and analog-electronic sounds, <em>Woodstock</em>. The band’s instant hit “Feel It Still” had not only landed its way onto Apple commercials, and found a temporary home at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Top 40, but it also won them the title of a Grammy-award winning Group Performance. The band melds their hip-hop influences on tracks like “So Young” that are reminiscent of the production found on legendary Quasimoto and MF DOOM albums.</p>\n<p>Portugal. The Man has mastered a way to interpolate montages of sounds that have impacted how the band crafts their instrumentation. The charge to their way at the top of the charts is credited to the band’s ability to use a Frank Ocean method of limiting the release of their music for four years in order to get the closest they can to a perfect album.  The album is attested to effectively collaborating with the industry’s top producers to create hits that submerge audiences into a world that touches everywhere from neoclassical soul to rap rhythms.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82720\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1950508301\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82717\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82720\" data-attachment-id=\"82720\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/sbbowl_siavash_ghadiri_portugal_the_man-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82720\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the concert hit the one hour mark, Portugal. The Man incentivized the crowd to stand up and scream the lyrics to the band’s well-known hit, “Feel It Still,” a song that has both meandered its way onto Apple and Vitamin Commercials and beat out the infamous Luis Fonsi and Justin Bieber collaboration “Despacito” at the Grammys.</p>\n<p>The band set their instruments aside and looked longingly to the packed crowd, teasing the crowd into believing that they were just about to end their set. The crowd ruptured in applause with the loudest shrieks coming from drunk 40-year-old men dressed in the go-to Portland hipster attire. Portugal. The Man answered the crowd’s demands by playing the genre-bending “Noise Pollution” and the anthemic “Hip Hop Kids” that combined the psychedelic visuals playing on the screen and the thundering drums.</p>\n<p>Chicano Batman escalated the excitement for the night, as their groovy-surf blend went hand-in-hand with gazing at SB Bowl’s hilltop view of the ocean. Meanwhile, Portugal. The Man brought their ability to alleviate temporary stress by illuminating the stage with gritty guitar solos and lively strobe lights straight from an 80s flick.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82717\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82717\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/","id":6632,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6631,6630,6629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alt-J and Børns Breeze Through Santa Barbara Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Since their emergence into the world of music six years ago, alt-J has grown from a small college band in Leeds to an internationally known indie sensation admired by many.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Like many people out there, my first interaction with the music of alt-J was hearing “Breezeblocks” on my local alternative rock radio station back in 2012.

It was during this time that die-hard fans of his made themselves apparent, as they begun to spring from their seats and caper in both the seated and general admission sections. Because of the time limit on his set, Børns sped his way through the first two-thirds of his set list by cutting out certain verses and choruses to reserve time for his other better-known singles.</p>\n<p>Once he brought out the guitar for “10,000 Emerald Pools” and begun strumming, everyone around me seemed to raise their heads in recognition and finally allowed themselves to join the surrounding excitement. Following this song were a couple others like “We Don’t Care,” “Sweet Dreams,” “Faded Heart” and finally the song that put him on the map: “Electric Love.” It was during this song that he picked up the guitar once again and invited the audience to sing the beginning harmonies along with him.</p>\n<p>While the headliners of this show were alt-J, it was quite clear that this crowd would now be leaving the SB Bowl with a new appreciation for the music, style and stage presence of a very Mick-Jagger-esque Børns.</p>\n<p>Although it was obvious that an alt-J concert would attract all the local hipsters here in Santa Barbara, it was quite interesting to see the diversity in the age of audience members. This further reinforces the likeability of alt-J, as they’re able to appeal to almost anyone — Glenn Howerton, better known as Dennis on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” was even there showing his support and admiration for the band as a fellow civilian concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82530\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"620383098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82528\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82530\" data-attachment-id=\"82530\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/alt-j-and-borns-breeze-through-santa-barbara-bowl/unnamed-54/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82530\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Beginning their lively set with “Deadcrush” off their newest studio album <em>Relaxer</em>, alt-J presented their fans with a very visually stunning stage setup and light show. From left to right was Gus Unger-Hamilton on keyboard, Joe Newman on guitar and vocals and Thom Sonny Green on drums, with each member divided by an open-knit curtain of lights that synchronized with the band’s music. Additionally, behind them was a giant lit-up triangle that the band uses as a logo since it comes from the Greek letter “delta” and represents change.</p>\n<p>Everywhere, fans were either jumping out of their seats and belting out each word to each song or happily relaxing while they bobbed their heads along to the contagious melodies. New songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Pleader” seemed to capture and maintain the attention of the crowd; however, it was incomparable to the change in audience hype when alt-J performed fan favorites like “Fitzpleasure,” “Tesselate” and “Matilda.” It was during these songs in particular that sober and drunk fans alike were able to come together and truly express their love for the music as one coherent entity.</p>\n<p>In an effort to wrap things up, alt-J ended their set with “Left Hand Free,” which has been played almost everywhere since its release and has since been featured in major motion picture films like “Captain America: Civil War.” This was the one that got each audience member up off their feet as they were enticed to sing along to the band’s biggest hit. All too soon though, the stage went from flickering purple and white lights to pure darkness, and everyone was left waiting in anticipation for an encore.</p>\n<p>In the end, the boys of alt-J came back out to perform an additional three songs for their eager and beloved fans, and the show concluded with the song that made them famous to begin with: “Breezeblocks.” After a night of playing a medley of old and new songs, it was rather refreshing to see alt-J go back to their roots and give thanks to the many that have helped them achieve this level of success. If you happened to miss this spectacular show here at the Santa Barbara Bowl, both alt-J and Børns, will be playing at Weekend 2 of Coachella –– so go catch them if you can.</p><div

third-year Julia Feldman might seem like a typical college kid, and on some levels she is. She studies, has an internship and frequently worries about her future. But Feldman isn’t just concerned with finding the perfect job in the right city like some of us might be. Through her pursuits of music, feminism and environmentalism, Feldman is trying to save the world.</p>\n<p>At age 17, Feldman found herself at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York, representing a new generation of young women making a splash.

Out of this desire came “Wolves,” a blistering, rocked-out anthem that encourages women not to withhold their ambitions because of anyone else. “It’s about how no matter what you do or what you say or wear, you are doing it for yourself… And there’s a whole squadron of women standing behind you,” said Feldman.</p>\n<p>Performing the song with her band BNTLY, “Wolves” became a crucial piece in helping the group land a distribution deal with Bungalow and Universal. Now, with shows planned around established clubs across Los Angeles and five more singles coming out this year, BNTLY is quickly emerging as band that’s here to stay.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82532\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"102983688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82532\" data-attachment-id=\"82532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>Yet, BNTLY and feminist activism only make up a portion of Feldman’s activities. In addition to writing and performing music, Feldman is a passionate environmental studies major at UCSB. She is currently an intern at the sustainability program on campus, leading the organization efforts of the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, which will host thousands of students from college campuses around the country later this year. Additionally, Feldman runs a blog discussing fashion and how it relates to sustainability and health. Although music is Feldman’s first priority, she is open to pursuing environmental activism as a backup career.</p>\n<p>This work ethic and diversity of interests does not go unnoticed: “Julia is a mixture of warmth, love, generosity and compassion while also being one of the most determined, focused and hardworking people I know,” said housemate and third-year art major Pilar Herrera. “She is a glass-half-full kind of lady and isn’t easily discouraged.”</p>\n<p>This view is echoed by her brother and BNTLY guitarist Adam Feldman. “She has always been able to multitask at a high level, and it’s no surprise that she is able to handle school, work, music and life, period. That’s just always been Julia,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The children of a singing and accordion-playing mother and a multi-talented musician of a father with ties to the industry<u>,</u> the Feldman children began their musical education in the Valley of Los Angeles from a young age. “[Our parents] decided that my brother and I would learn an instrument no matter what,” said Julia. “They started us with guitar, but then I found out I could sing, so I really took off with that while Adam took off with guitar.”</p>\n<p>Naturally, the two began writing songs together. When Adam was 13 and Julia 11, the two started sitting down together to collaborate. What started out as a way to kill time at home quickly progressed into a serious hobby within the first year. Years later they’ve refined their writing process, collaborating as the main songwriters for BNTLY.</p>\n<p>“Our process is super organic. No frills, no nothing,” said Adam. “One of us has an idea, whether it be melodic or lyrical, and we just build the song from the ground up, lyrics and music at the same time so they fit perfectly.”</p>\n<p>Listening to BNTLY, this process can be easily traced. On “Wolves,” Julia’s soulful vocals weave around the same melody as Adam’s roaring, wah-wah guitar riff. Adding tricky licks and vocal runs, Adam and Julia add a layer of complexity to the seemingly rudimentary foundation of the song.</p>\n<p>The Feldman siblings also credit their musical prowess to their father’s teachings on various musical genres. “He would drive around and give us little music history lessons,” said Julia. “We would start out in the ’60s with classic rock, blues and funk.” Julia acknowledges that these early lessons helped her hone the style of her biggest influences, which include Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder and Sly and the Family Stone.</p>\n<p>Adam also believes that the fact that Julia wasn’t just focused on vocally driven pop music is what makes her so fun to listen to and collaborate with. “She understands that she is a part of a larger entity, making for a much more cohesive sound over all,” Adam elaborated. “It is a type of musical maturity that some vocalists never get to in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Constantly exploring new ways to empower women and improve her abilities as a singer, Julia is looking to diversify her influences by looking at more female performers. Julia has taken a liking to neo-soul and praises the work of the female artists Kehlani, H.E.R., NAO and Lianne La Havas. Julia has even made a point of covering female artists in Isla Vista including a scathing rendition of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” with her old band Poster Child.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82533\" style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"738330862\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82533\" data-attachment-id=\"82533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=1080%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>While two of the band members of Poster Child have since graduated and moved to San Francisco and Los Angeles to begin professions in chemistry and accounting respectively, Julia fondly recalls the Isla Vista music scene. “One time spring quarter we played at my drummer Shane’s backyard on DP. We pushed two beer die tables up against the fence, and that was the stage,” said Julia. “We used to pack his backyard with people, and others from the street would come and listen. I talk to friends who go to college in other places, and they can’t do anything like that.”</p>\n<p>It is likely, however, that Julia’s passion for music and her endeavors in environmental justice and gender equality might not be able to co-exist forever. “It is interesting hearing about how her busy-ness is split between two different identities, that of a student and that of an aspiring musician,” said Herrera. “For how much she is doing, and given that I see a lot of the behind-the-scenes-Julia, her work ethic and positive attitude are seriously so impressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite constantly seeming to exhibit this positivity, even Julia feels the pressure of the future. “I’m so scared that I’m going to wake up when I’m 30 and have this job that I don’t care about and just be like, ‘Oh my god what happened?’”</p>\n<p>For now, Julia has one primary goal, common through each of her interests: She wants to make a change. “I feel some of the heavy shit in the world,” she said. “I just want to have a purpose and leave a mark in a positive way.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With his ninth film, “Isle of Dogs,” hitting theaters this weekend, the esoteric auteur’s filmography could end up becoming one of the most celebrated in American cinema. Of course, his aesthetic can rub some people the wrong way, as some criticize his celebration of style over substance. However, Anderson’s distinct style and personality is what makes his films so worthy of praise. Tim Burton remains perhaps the only other director whose distinctive vision has become so recognizable.</p>\n<p>After revisiting Anderson’s films and seeing “Isle of Dogs” in theaters, Artsweek presents our definitive ranking of Wes Anderson’s movies.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong> “Bottle Rocket”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hspUSez-rYY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>Anderson’s first foray into filmmaking features Owen and Luke Wilson’s acting debuts as two petty thieves on a series of hilariously bungled heists.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment:</strong> Dignan (Owen Wilson) obsessively planning his heists as a part of a 75-year plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: </strong>The low-stakes nature of the crimes adds a lot of humor, and Owen Wilson’s snappy delivery and wit keep the story moving.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: “</strong>Bottle Rocket” lacks a lot of Anderson’s trademarks, such as his famous diorama-like framing and angular pans. The heists are funny because they’re so terribly executed, but they fail to create tension. In the end, the film just wasn’t as memorable as some of Anderson’s more eccentric films that followed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh401Rmkq0o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>Steve Zissou, a declining oceanographer and documentarian played by Bill Murray, sets out with his crew to kill the shark that ate his best friend. Just before they leave, a man claiming to be Zissou’s son (Owen Wilson) shows up and asks to come along.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>The eccentricities of Team Zissou, from the Brazilian singer who sings Portuguese David Bowie covers to the nine unpaid interns from the University of North Alaska. Also, the entire crew wears red beanies.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: </strong>Anderson has always had a soft spot for unconventional characters, and “Life Aquatic” features perhaps the most peculiar set of all his films. For fans of that aspect of Anderson’s work, this movie remains the most iconic.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>The story and writing don’t measure up to the other films. Many of the characters are rather one-note and don’t seem as believable as the other oddball characters in the other films.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> “Rushmore”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxCNDpvGyss?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>A precocious young boy named Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman, is involved in nearly every extracurricular activity at Rushmore Academy, yet he earns failing grades. He falls in love with a third grade teacher at the school, and his antics escalate more and more as he tries to impress her and stop her from falling for Herman Blume, played by Bill Murray.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>The ridiculous yearbook montage of all of Max Fischer’s extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: “</strong>Rushmore” will always be remembered as Anderson’s first big hit and is a worthwhile watch for that reason alone. Schwartzman’s and Murray’s performances cemented them as indie film icons, and this film marks the start of many of the iconic editing and cinematography techniques associated with Anderson’s work.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>The story doesn’t have the same momentum of many of Anderson’s other films. Schwartzman gives Fischer so much life and is able to hold the audience, but the meandering nature of the plot makes it stand out less than the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> “Fantastic Mr. Fox”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2igjYFojUo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>An animated fox named Mr. Fox and his family move into a new tree home despite his lawyer and friend Badger’s warnings that the area is unsafe for foxes. When Mr. Fox falls back into his stealing days and robs the three neighboring farms, conflict arises between the farmers and all the animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>Every cuss word is replaced with the word “cuss.” Another one of Anderson’s “cussing” brilliant writing quirks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: </strong>The lighthearted and fun story and characters are perfect for an animated kids movie, and the wry humor makes it a film adults can enjoy. The animation is also stunning, especially with the outfits of the characters. The characters themselves are superbly voice-acted, with George Clooney in the main role.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>The story and formal elements of “Isle of Dogs” appealed more to an adult audience, and I couldn’t quite justify putting “Fantastic Mr. Fox” above Anderson’s other foray into animation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> “Isle of Dogs”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dt__kig8PVU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>In a future dystopian Japan that has exiled all dogs to Trash Island after a canine flu outbreak, Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin) journeys to Trash Island to find his dog, Spots. Five dogs help the boy find Spots and uncover the truth behind the government’s canine deportation policy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>Atari and Chief (Bryan Cranston) bond as they journey across Trash Island to the song “I Won’t Hurt You” by The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. Honorable mention to the unique way Anderson shows Chief imagining Nutmeg’s (Scarlett Johansson) tricks from when she was a show dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: </strong>The implementation of Japanese art like Atari’s haiku, the Kabuki-inspired prologue and the Japanese percussion throughout, as well as the voice acting for the dogs — particularly Cranston as Chief — gave the world and characters so much life.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>The film’s quirky conceit of all the human characters speaking their native Japanese with minimal subtitles while the dogs speak English is hilarious, but it leaves many of the human characters flat. Anderson gave himself a tough challenge with that constraint, but the constant need to find in-character justifications for translation took me a bit out of the film at times.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> “Moonrise Kingdom”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7N8wkVA4_8s?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>A Khaki scout and a young girl run away from their unhappy homes to be together in the wilderness in this eccentric coming-of-age love story.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>The geometric panning shots during the opening and closing scenes with Suzy’s brothers listening to their record player.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: “</strong>Moonrise Kingdom” explores young love in a quirky and fantastical way not often seen in Hollywood, and it isn’t corny at all. The acting performances of the two young stars sell the precocious dialogue, and the supporting characters like Edward Norton’s Scout Master Ward and Bruce Willis’s Police Captain Sharp round out the excellent cast of characters. To young Suzy and Sam, their love is the most important, earth-shaking event in their lives, and the way the story is told it feels that way to the audience, which is what movies are about.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>The third act does linger on a bit much for me. The tension throughout the first two-thirds of the movie is no longer present in the final sequences, but the story is wrapped up well in the end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> “The Darjeeling Limited”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO1bYukdvLI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>Three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman) go to India on a spiritual journey following their father’s death a year earlier while dealing with their own personal issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>The final tableau of the brothers throwing their luggage to catch the next train that brings all of the themes of the film into one image.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: </strong>The film’s portrayal of grief and brotherhood gets to the heart of human nature and the ways we sometimes get in our own way. Each brother completes a journey throughout the film that’s mirrored in small motifs related to each character, like Peter (Brody) and his father’s prescription sunglasses, which he holds onto despite them giving him a headache.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>There’s not much I can fault with the film, but it doesn’t reach the same Andersonian formal peak that the films above it do. Additionally, the plot’s resolution is a bit too neat for my taste, particularly when considered alongside most of Anderson’s other films, which tend to have more bittersweet endings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> “The Royal Tenenbaums”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eg6yIwP2vs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>A dysfunctional family centered on three former child prodigies have to cope with their estranged father returning home with a supposed terminal illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>Margot exiting a bus in slow motion over the guitars of “These Days” by Nico is perhaps the best cinematic representation of seeing someone you love that’s been gone for too long.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: “</strong>The Royal Tenenbaums” has a large ensemble cast, yet each character has their definitive moments, and it feels like they are on screen for the perfect amount of time. The relationships between the characters have nuance and all change as the story goes along at the perfect pace. In that sense, “The Royal Tenenbaums” can be considered Anderson’s most well-written work, and it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Wasn’t Higher: </strong>This really comes down to personal preference, and that’s what makes Anderson’s work so fun to discuss. I imagine there are plenty of people who see their own family in the Tenenbaums, but for me it doesn’t resonate quite as much as the film in our top spot.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> “The Grand Budapest Hotel”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Fg5iWmQjwk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>Premise: </strong>The film follows the concierge M. Gustave and his Lobby Boy apprentice, Zero Moustafa, in the 1930s Golden Age of the hotel. Then, a missing priceless painting leads to murder and mystery for our protagonists.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Wes Anderson Moment: </strong>The Society of the Crossed Keys sequence featuring cameos from nearly all of Anderson’s regular collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Great: “</strong>The Grand Budapest Hotel” achieved more critical success than any other Anderson film, and for good reason. Zubrowka and the hotel act like Anderson’s perfect formal playground. The way he contrasts the chaotic happenings of the hotel with the long tracking shots formally matches the way Gustave controls such a wild atmosphere so well. So many sequences stand out in formal mastery, yet these sequences also carry so much energy and excitement for the story. The suspense of the sequence following Willem Dafoe’s sinister character make sure there’s never a dull moment. That combination of visual brilliance and heart-pounding story — to say nothing of the beautiful ending — is something that few directors can achieve. Here Anderson is his best, enough said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/worst-to-best-artsweek-ranks-wes-anderson-films/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/worst-to-best-artsweek-ranks-wes-anderson-films/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/worst-to-best-artsweek-ranks-wes-anderson-films/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/worst-to-best-artsweek-ranks-wes-anderson-films/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/worst-to-best-artsweek-ranks-wes-anderson-films/","id":6148,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6147,6146,6145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Annihilation’: More Shimmer Than Substance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/annihilation-natalie-portman-shooting-deer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/annihilation-natalie-portman-shooting-deer.jpg?resize=970%2C545&ssl=1","description":"“Annihilation” is a visual feast and highly suspenseful, even downright scary at times.

Is this a supernatural occurrence? The end of life as we know it? Before we can wrap our heads around this, the scene ends abruptly. A cell materializes on the screen and begins to divide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lest there be any confusion, a voiceover tells us, “This is a cell… one became two. Two became four. Then eight…” and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening sequence is a microcosm for the rest of the movie. Based on Jeff VanderMeer’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southern Reach</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trilogy, “Annihilation” strives for philosophical sci-fi by being as ambiguous as possible while simultaneously explaining itself to death. While visually stunning and occasionally thrilling, its structure is incoherent and its storytelling is contrived. Garland’s use of the “show, don’t tell” technique is what made “Ex Machina” an outstanding first feature. “Annihilation” tells rather than shows, and that is where it runs into problems.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The disembodied voice from the cell tutorial belongs to Lena (Natalie Portman),  a soldier-turned-biologist and university professor. A hokey conversation with a colleague reveals that her personal life is in shambles. Her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac), who embarked on a top-secret military mission a year prior and never returned, is presumed dead. That afternoon, however, who should walk in but Kane himself. Lena is bewildered and overcome with joy. Kane is equally confused, but seems cold and distant. It becomes clear that he is seriously ill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On their way to the hospital, Lena and Kane are intercepted by the military. They are taken to a sprawling, remote complex that is home to a government agency tasked with gathering intel about Area X. The Shimmer, as it is also known, is an ever-expanding forcefield that resembles a giant soap bubble. A psychologist named Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) informs Lena that it was caused by a meteor crash (yeah, that one). She also explains that venturing into the Shimmer is “a suicide mission.” Kane is the only person to ever make it out alive, and now he is dying. Ventress is leading a final expedition, along with a team of specialists: Cass (Tuva Nuvotny), an anthropologist, Josie (Tessa Thompson), a physicist and Anya (Gina Rodriguez), a paramedic. Lena is allowed to tag along for her expertise in biology, which ends up being the only discipline relevant to their mission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expedition leads them into a world which defies all laws of nature and science. Everything in the Shimmer is genetically mutated: plants take on humanoid form, animals become grotesque monsters and everything is covered in rainbow-colored fungi. Things start to fall apart as they uncover what happened on the previous mission and undergo grueling physical and psychological experiences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such an intriguing premise, “Annihilation” had the potential for greatness. However, the complexity of the set-up is unmatched by its characters. Nothing screams “written and directed by a man” more than flat, one-dimensional female roles. Movies dominated by women, especially female scientists, are few and far between. Here was an opportunity to create empowering, nuanced characters with a star-studded cast, and “Annihilation” completely squandered it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of what makes it difficult to feel emotionally attached to these characters is that we know nothing about them. The script tries to make up for this with heavy-handed dialogue. Midway through their journey, Cass and Lena share a canoe and discuss the dangers of their mission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cass says that only messed-up people volunteer to go into the Shimmer: “We’re all damaged goods here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then outlines what makes each woman a “damaged good,” naming every cliche from substance abuse to mental illness. It’s one of many bits that uses cheap, contrived dialogue to quickly dole out information. Twice, Ventress shrieks, “It’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annihilation!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” as if to remind us what movie we’re watching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these flaws, “Annihilation” might be worth seeing, if only for the last 20 minutes. Afterward, I found that I’d crumpled up my ticket in suspense. Garland’s style shines in scenes with limited dialogue, scenes that show instead of tell. A stress-inducing electronic score and mind-blowing effects contribute to the gripping action. At other parts of the movie, some of the special effects felt overdone, making it somewhat hard to buy into the world of the Shimmer. Here, they steal the show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key ingredient to any great science-fiction story is likable characters to whom the audience feels emotionally attached. It’s difficult to care about a movie when the fate of its characters seems utterly inconsequential. “Annihilation” is a visual feast and highly suspenseful, even downright scary at times. However, it’s hard to get around the lackluster characters, overworked dialogue and vague conclusion. Ultimately, “Annihilation” is akin to the look in Kane’s eyes after he returns from the Shimmer: empty, meaningless and devoid of feeling.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Annihilation” is currently playing in wide release.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.

an entirely different world than other music genres. Rap, pop, rock and electronic music have always intermingled with each other and in recent years have been increasingly intertwined as crossover hits have ruled the airwaves. We live in a post Kanye and Paul McCartney collaboration world, where Rihanna knows Tame Impala and Beyoncé was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Song. The general public has embraced this new post-genre world with one large exception; Country music remains the black sheep of the music industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest I’ve been a proud member of the I’ll-listen-to-anything-but-country club for years, which is why I was shocked when I found myself not only listening to, but enjoying Kacey Musgraves’ new release. On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golden Hour</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, her third studio album, Musgraves takes a vacation from the strict boundaries of Nashville sonically and lyrically, exploring a new vibrant sound filled with elements of pop, funk, folk and even disco. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golden Hour</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still undoubtedly a country album. There are all the typical allusions to cowboys, horses, and pickup trucks, sung with dixie-tinged croons. However, in Musgraves’s world, these elements seem to float effortlessly in zero gravity with rainbows, flowers and weed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album opener, “Slow Burn,” acts as a psychedelic treaty outlining the artist’s journey of spiritual enlightenment. The song begins grounded in reality as details of her early life are accompanied by simple strums of the guitar. Sonic elements are slowly added and built upon each other as she begins to muse over her laidback outlook on life. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the chorus she belts out her climatic mantra: “I’m alright with a slow burn, taking my time … I’m gonna do it my way, it’ll be alright.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time the second chorus ends, Musgraves has painted an abstract, tonal landscape atmospheres away from where she began. As she utters “whatever feels good,” her audience is floating with her in a blissful, flower-filled utopia. Musgraves is not overthinking anything, but rather slowly enjoying the simplicities of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “High Horse,” Musgraves’ biggest departure from her Nashville roots, she accomplishes an allusive pop-country crossover that effortlessly blends the energy of a danceable summertime radio track while still paying an authentic homage to her country roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She fuses banjo and disco beats in a dissertation against those “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who think they’re cooler than everybody else</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” creating an irresistibly fun song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her signature wordplay and wit are in full force as she playfully delivers lines like “Darling, you take the high horse and I’ll take the high road” and “If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo,” that allow her to cut down her subjects while never leaving her realm of carefree cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other recent attempts at pop-country crossovers, like Lady Gaga’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joanne</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have come off as either artificial or disingenuine, taking country sentiments hostage as a mere costume to try on. Musgraves, however, mends the two genres to create her own unique musical viewpoint, which never feels forced or pretentious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sentiment is continued on the bubbly “Butterflies”, which captures the floating feelings of the beginning of love. Through a series of “winged” metaphors, she brings her audience into her chest with breathy vocals and sweet strums of guitar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chorus, “And now, you’re lifting me up ‘stead of holding me down/Stealing my heart ‘stead of stealing my crown,” continues Musgraves’s treaty of optimism, authenticity and love, which flows through each track of the record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the eponymous “Golden Hour,” Musgraves is stripped back, serenading her lover over her satisfied outlook on life. She truly captures the magic of the hour before sunset can bestow, with long, smooth, angelic vocals and a calm accompanying soundtrack creating a dreamy soundscape. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song’s nonchalant pacing and lyrics come together as she muses over her contentment, singing “And I know, I know everything’s gonna be alright.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the sun’s golden hour paints the world in its most pleasing light, Musgraves’ blissful point of view depicts the world through a lens of optimistic enthusiasm. In a period of human history plagued with cynicism and divisiveness, the songwriter’s exploration of positivity comes as a welcoming relief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist’s use of modern subject matter throughout the record further cements her as the future of country. Multiple references to marijuana and psychedelics spread throughout the album reveal Musgraves’ commitment to honesty and artistic expression. Rather than shy away from subjects which could alienate country fans, she paints her world without censure. While she has already established herself as firm advocate of LGBTQ+ rights, her commitment to queer imagery has made her a queer icon. Songs like “Rainbow” and “High Horse” have resonated with queer audiences and have introduced to these audiences to a genre which is not always welcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Country music has always been obsessed with freedom, yet it has always placed strict musical and thematic boundaries on itself, which has tethered the genre to the past. By superseding these limitations, Musgraves captures a new aspect of freedom, which is often overlooked by her contemporaries. Kacey Musgraves may have broken the rules of country, but she’s too content and self-assured to care.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

music and produced creative tracks that proves his growing originality. On the six-track, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd continues to innovate while producing numbing, cathartic post-break-up music that reflects a new style of R&amp;B.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, began his musical journey in 2011 with his mixtape </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House of Balloons </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and since then, has broken numerous boundaries within the R&amp;B genre. While categorized as an R&amp;B and pop singer, he managed to create his own niche with a slower, darker, and sensual version of the styles, while attaching his soulful, smooth voice to the sounds. Even though it’s been labeled reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s style, The Weeknd’s high pitch smooth tone defies traditional pop music. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is centered around a very somber theme, which is indicated by the title itself. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Similarly, closing song “Privilege” sounds like it was pulled straight from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trilogy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with soft vocals and lyrics that are simultaneously sensual and painful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This track seems to be his attempt at creating peace within himself, as he even says “let’s try to end it with a smile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work as a whole seems to reflect his inner quarrel between grief and love, as he finally settles with his emotions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd’s most recent albums, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiss Land, Starboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beauty Behind the Madness, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deviate from his original music, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seems to combine the many different sounds of these albums</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project is consistent with the Weeknd’s original introspectiveness, and also brings back the original Abel that fans loved. Maybe </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is The Weeknd’s attempt at returning to his most loved </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trilogy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">production, or maybe he’s moving toward a new direction that continues to combine pop, alternative rock, and R&amp;B — only the next album will tell. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Santa Barbara Bowl on April 16 with musical guest, Børns. Known for hits like “Left Hand Free” and “Breezeblocks,” alt-J has since added more tracks to their roster of fun, festival music perfect for the laid-back beach lifestyle here in SB.</p>\n<p>Opening up the show will be the multi-talented singer-songwriter Børns. Originally from Michigan, Garrett Borns has been a creative force since age 10 when he was a professional magician and eventually worked his way up to receiving awards for his drawings and various other forms of visual art. At 19 he was even giving TED Talks, during which he’d perform original songs right on stage.</p>\n<p>Since making his first debut in 2015 with his album <em>Dopamine,</em> Børns has made his way onto the charts with hit singles like “Electric Love,” “American Money” and “10,000 Emerald Pools.” This past January, he released his second studio album, <em>Blue Madonna,</em> which features Lana Del Rey on multiple tracks and encompasses heavy themes of heartbreak, confusion and love. In addition to playing this show with alt-J, Børns will also be performing both weekends this year at Coachella.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a three-year period of no new music, alt-J is finally on the road again touring for their new album, <em>Relaxer, </em>which came out June 2nd of last year and was nominated for the Mercury Prize of 2017.</p>\n<p>While alt-J consider themselves “just guys from Leeds who muddled through it,” many seem to think otherwise; their music has been included in popular, high-grossing films like “Silver Linings Playbook,” “Captain America: Civil War” and others.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2008 as a simple college band self-producing music through GarageBand, alt-J has since grown into the indie sensation they are today, headlining their own tours and playing in various music festivals around the world.</p>\n<p>Although their new album contains only eight songs, alt-J’s most recent <em>Relaxer</em> represents a slight change and growth in the band’s musical abilities and direction. <em>Relaxer</em> differs from its predecessors as it incorporates darker themes and slower songs as seen in tracks like “3WW,” “Adeline,” “Last Year” and their cover of The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun.” However, don’t let this discourage you from listening as the album also features fun songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Hit Me Like That Snare” which are reminiscent of the classic alt-J sound made present in previous albums <em>This Is All Yours</em> and <em>An Awesome Wave</em>. Alt-J will also be performing both weekends of Coachella this year in case you can’t make the show here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Tickets are still available! They can be found online at <em>sbbowl.com</em> and range from $50-$60 in price.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/alt-j-to-bring-indie-bliss-to-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6675,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6674,6673,6672],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/artsweek","page":14,"highestPage":67}},"__N_SSG":true}
