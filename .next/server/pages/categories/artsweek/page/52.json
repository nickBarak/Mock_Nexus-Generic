As a first-timer at Muddy Waters Coffee House, which is just a mile away from the bustling excitement of State Street, I immediately felt at home. Its dim lighting, art-filled walls, funky light fixtures and vintage couches gave the venue a cozy and relaxed feel. Enthusiastic members from all over the Santa Barbara and greater SoCal area welcomed the two Cali-based bands to the scene last Friday night, Oct. 17 as a part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>YELLOW RED SPARKS</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57737\" style=\"width: 355px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"712349381\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57737\" data-attachment-id=\"57737\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/yellow-red-sparks-1012-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1337478691\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57737\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=345%2C230\" alt=\"Courtesy of wptsradio.com\" width=\"345\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>wptsradio.com</em></p></div>\n<p>The first band, Yellow Red Sparks, is a four-piece collective from Irvine, Calif., composed of Joshua Hanson (vocals/songwriter/guitar), Darren “Goldy” Goldstein (drums), Sarah Lynn Nishikawa (bass) and Mike Harris (keyboard).

This tune quickly drew in a crowd to the main area of the coffee shop, with attendees bopping their heads and swaying their bodies to the rhythm. Slowing down the mood of the locale, their second song “Buy Me Honey” revealed a more melodramatic theme. They continued to play songs off their self-titled album, including the popular “Scents and Sensibility” and “Monsters with Misdemeanors,” as well as new songs not yet released.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the show was their rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Hanson asked the audience to sing along to “help break some ice,” which ended up bringing the crowd even closer together. The combination of Hanson’s dulcet voice with the melodic group vocals of the audience created a beautiful and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The band’s cinematic/indie folk tunes and sentimental melodies fused together to produce uplifting and heartfelt anthems. Their fun stage presence also added to the intimacy of the set, making me feel lucky that I was able to be a part of something so inimitable. Closing out with a song titled “Seven Seas,” which the group announced will be coming out next month, the Yellow Red Sparks left a positive vibe behind in Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p>After their set, I caught up with them on the sidewalk outside of the venue. When I asked how Yellow Red Sparks came to be, they had an interesting story to tell. “Basically, I was just doing coffee shop stuff and Goldy took some of my songs and added drums to it,” Hanson explained. From there, Goldy introduced Hanson to Nishikawa, an upright bass player who Goldy was teaching drums to at the time. The trio formed a band, and later added the fourth member, Mike, who the group affectionately calls the “newbie.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the significance of their band name, Hanson laid out the dynamics for me. “The band name initially comes from our song entitled ‘Yellow Red Sparks,’ which is also a part of our self-titled album. To me, the phrase means passion, with the mellow color of yellow colliding with the vibrant color of red.”</p>\n<p>Adding to this comment, Goldy mentioned that “the term mirrors the emotional push-and-pull that comes with relationships — both the loving and the heated parts.” These opposite emotions, which we all can identify with, were felt through the set as their songs encompassed expressions of both joy and melancholy as a way to meticulously depict all realities of what it means to be human. I could sense this up-and-down pattern as the band moved from song to song, feeling hopeful through one moment and feeling somber through the other.</p>\n<p>These ideas tie in with the main themes of the band’s lyrics. “Our songs are about human stuff,” said Hanson in a whimsical manner. “They’re all about struggling with relationships and the challenge of maintaining faith and hope throughout it all. I like to call it the human struggle.”</p>\n<p>I could tell that Hanson was deep in his thoughts by the way he stared at the concrete beneath him, hands in his pockets. For a second he collected his thoughts, a slight frown on his forehead. Suddenly he looked up and continued, “The goal for us is to affect people with music. We don’t just want it to be something that people bop their heads to, but to be something that makes people feel something.”</p>\n<p>A genuine look on his face, Hanson left me with this message: “We want to connect with people and take that as far as we can, whether that’s to a hundred people or to thousands of people. As cliché as it sounds, we just want to change people’s lives through music.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57739\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1148114756\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57739\" data-attachment-id=\"57739\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/kinds/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"479,319\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kinds\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57739\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=356%2C236\" alt=\"Courtesy of independent.com\" width=\"356\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?w=479&amp;ssl=1 479w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57739\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>independent.com</em></p></div>\n<p>THE KINDS</p>\n<p>The headlining band, The Kinds, is a local group from Santa Barbara, Calif. Formed by Khasy Modisette (vocals/guitar), Nathan Modisette (bass), Anders Bergstrom (guitar/back-up vocals) and Erich Riedl (drums), the band hit the sweet spot for many locals and non-locals that have been anticipating the performance for months. While the band has played the New Noise Festival before, this was their first time headlining for the event.</p>\n<p>They opened their performance with one of their most popular songs, “Been a Long Time.” This song combined the soothing rhythm of the guitar with the compelling female vocals of the lead singer, which immediately set a warm tone for the show. Elements of indie, folk, rock and country were apparent throughout their songs, fascinating the crowd with irresistible forms of musicianship that nobody could quite walk away from.</p>\n<p>While their set included emotionally-striking songs that were a little on the slow side, they also included high-energy tunes that got the whole crowd to dance. The faster songs included empowering guitar solos and catchy melodies, while the slower ones transformed the venue into a wistful scene. While every song was unique on its own, each tune brought out romantic and heart-felt themes about love and equality.</p>\n<p>The showmanship of the combo also created a folksy mood that perfectly complimented the relaxed feel of the coffee shop. Band members smiled often, sipping on beers. They even described one of their songs, entitled “Runaway”, as a “beer drinking song,” and quickly turned this anecdote into a drinking game by encouraging the crowd to take a sip from their brews during certain lyrics.</p>\n<p>I stuck around after their set and had a chance to interview Modisette and Bergstrom as they were packing up their equipment. The lead lady singer told me about the creation of The Kinds, which sprang to life about five years ago. “Nate and I were playing together for a while when one of our close friends introduced us to Erich. Out of the blue, Anders showed up and starting playing with us,” said Modisette. “It all worked together really well, and the creation of the band was just kind of instant.”</p>\n<p>From there, The Kinds have focused on playing local shows with more casual intentions. “Part of the reason why I love playing with this ensemble is that everybody is on a professional level, but we just do it for fun,” explained Bergstrom with a gleeful look on his face. “This is our passion, and being able to play and have a great time doing it is really why we’re here.” From what I could tell, the convivial response from their close-knit Santa Barbara supporters is all The Kinds really need.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other bands, The Kinds have no desire to get signed. Apart from having daytime jobs and families to take care of, they come together as a band to focus most of their attention on enjoying the act of music-making. In regards to making it big, however, getting signed is one of their last priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost not even a consideration. It just doesn’t seem like us,” said Modisette. Nodding his head, Bergstrom laughably commented that each member comes “from different facets of the music industry, and there was this interesting moment that we realized that we could be as good as anybody but not be as stressed as everybody else.” All in all, The Kinds are just a good-hearted, small-town band who wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>As the night came to a close, it was certain that The Kinds’ nonchalant take on music and folksy tunes had once more left a warm impression on the guests of Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

lead singer Jackson Guthy shouted, energized by a full house. ­­Dressed in a tee and skinnies, Guthy charismatically eyed the screaming group of teenage girls lined along the walls, desperate for the boys’ attention. Drummer Rob Ketchum, bassist Edison Lo, keyboardist Nolan Frank and guitarist Michael O’Grady accompanied Guthy’s singing with synchronized hair-whipping and lyric-mouthing. Families relished in a candlelit dinner as the band rocked the evening with newly composed songs, which will constitute their first album. As part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival, the group took the stage on Sunday, Oct. 19 at SOhO Restaurant and Music Club, a perfectly intimate setting for a sneak peak of their upcoming album. “American Idol” judge Randy Jackson, North of Nine’s producer, made an appearance at the concert to support and take pride in his new band.</p>\n<p>The modern pop-rock quintet performed a set list of six songs including their debut single “We Ride,” which premiered on MTV in Sept. For this piece, keyboardist Nolan Frank stepped aside for the song’s writer and composer, Guthy, to play keyboard alongside rounded-out drumming and guitar. The ballad displayed the delicate side of the pop-rockers, leaving enchanted fans listening to the song on loop.</p>\n<p>Emily Castro, a recent fan of the band, is looking forward to North of Nine’s first album. “[‘We Ride’] is <em>so </em>soothing. I almost wish Jack was serenading to me … But besides that, they’re gonna bring something fresh and I’m looking forward to it!” Castro said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sixth on the set list that evening was a cover of Jimmy Eat World’s top five <em>Billboard </em>Hot 100 hit in 2002, “The Middle.” The band brought back the vitality of Jimmy Eat World and had the audience up on their feet, clapping to the beat. Further information on the night’s set list cannot be provided until the release of their first album.</p>\n<p>The group performed a variety of tunes throughout the night, taking their audience back and forth stylistically in their music. In sync with the current rock scene, the group labels themselves under modern pop-rock — which ranges from a mellower form of rock music to a subgenre of pop music. North of Nine appeals to the teenage age group with lyrics such as, “Lovin‘ you is like flyin‘ a rocket to the moon.”</p>\n<p>The band created contagious, energetic vibes as they indulged themselves in their music. The newly-formed group interacted closely onstage with dynamic expressions and exaggerated movements. Ricky Vitucci, the quintet’s artist coordinator, insisted that the group’s exceptional chemistry exists both on- and offstage. “The chemistry is crazy good for five males in one room … they all have different ideas. They don’t fight; they don’t argue. The vibe is amazing. When they’re in the same room, they get raw ideas like this,” Vitucci said as he snapped his fingers.</p>\n<p>After the performance, I caught up with bassist Edison Lo and he told me what fans should expect in the near future. “By the end of the year, we wanna release an album. We’ve been writing a lot, rehearsing a lot. Right now, we’re doing a bunch of demo songs,” said Lo. Vitucci added at the end, “<em>You’re in for a treat</em>.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/sV_hOnquxi8frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sV_hOnquxi8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>North of Nine’s new hit single “We Ride” is on iTunes and Spotify.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57748\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57748\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/","id":7078,"author":{"id":750,"name":"Sophie Ho"},"related":[7077,7076,7075],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rock in Paradise: Five Reasons We’re Really Gonna Miss Crystal Castles","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“I am leaving Crystal Castles.” Band member Alice Glass tweeted this on the morning of Oct. 8, which was all it took to send nearly all of Twitter into hysterics.

In the vague tweets that followed, she talked about conveying “sincerity, honesty, and empathy” in her art and foreshadowed the start of a solo career. The Canadian duo, comprised of Glass and (former) counterpart Ethan Kath had been together since 2004. Since then, the group has released a number of albums, experimenting with fast-paced synthesized chiptune and warped vocals, which gained them a sizeable cult following over the years.</p>\n<p>Here are five reasons to be thankful that the Crystal Castles ever existed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alice Glass is a total badass.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Female performers are no strangers to the handsy male “fans” in their audience (see also: Courtney Love, Iggy Azalea, etc.). When a guy in the crowd at Latitude Festival in the UK allegedly touched her breast in 2010 while the songstress was crowd-surfing, Glass was not passive about it. Instead, she contemptuously started punching and spitting on the offender.

In an interview with a Japanese magazine in 2008, he said that he had wanted to make the song “XXZXCUZX ME” sound “grating” on purpose. When asked why, Kath responded, “To weed out the wimps, annoy the posers. We are saying, ‘we are not for you.’” That may sound harsh but you almost can’t help but respect his brash honesty.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>They themselves have great taste (and showcase it).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is there anything better than knowing you and somebody you like share similar taste? There are probably lots of better things, but that’s still a satisfying feeling, and Crystal Castles teamed up with their musical favorites, who coincidentally happened to be ours. In 2010 Crystal Castles released “Not In Love,” their collaboration with The Cure’s Robert Smith, letting us know that, not only are they awesome, they also must have pretty awesome taste. The track sounds eerily reminiscent of a The Cure song backed with tantalizing electronic basslines and dance hooks. And who could forget their cameo in the UK TV show, “Skins?” The band was featured performing their song “Alice Practice” in the background of some underground club while Sid told Tony his father had passed. Cue the emotions.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Their live shows are insane.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although I’ve only had the experience of attending their live show once, I can tell you that it’s more of a riot than a concert. The crowd itself started off tamer than the band, but by the first or second song, the band’s wild and facetious attitude rubbed off on everyone in the room. Okay, maybe not everyone (event security is usually not digging it). Kath and Glass’s synergy onstage makes for an oddly-balanced stage presence. Kath, the calmer of the two, provided the beat on his drums or keyboard in the background, while Glass could be seen climbing and jumping on every possible surface, regularly shouting her lines from atop the drum kit or speakers or from within the audience. Through all this, the crowd entered a volatile, if not slightly dangerous, state of sheer passion and chaos.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>They provided the perfect outlet for your pent-up teenage angst.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re reading this, chances are the years of your adolescence overlapped perfectly with Crystal Castle’s ten-year life span. Coupled with static-y beats replete with energy and aggression, the songs’ lyrics are often lost amongst the white noise of it all. It can be easy to forget or overlook the fact that there are meaningful lyrics which convey themes about love, human emotions and social and political oppression. The song “Plague” opens with the lines “I need you pure, I need you clean,” tapping into the emotional pain and conflict that often accompanies growing older and breaking out of the social concept of “purity”. The song also features lyrics like, “Don’t try to enlighten me. Power to misconstrue / What have they done to you,” referencing corruptive realities imposed on youths, masquerading as what’s normal and accepted in society while also contributing to the loss of purity.</p>\n<p>There will never be another band quite like Crystal Castles, but rather than mourn their deterioration, it is important to celebrate and appreciate their contribution to music as well as the lives of countless fans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/JxVm2_ojQtkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JxVm2_ojQtk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57727\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57727\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/","id":7651,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[7650,7649,7648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Halloween With Snakefist: Local Band to Play Whiskey Richards","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  The California golden hour was just beginning to cool off as I arrived at Snakefist’s studio.

Mike Johansson, the bass player of the up-and-coming hard rock band, greeted me in front of an archetypal Santa Barbara home.</p>\n<p>Johansson, a relaxed classic rocker and fresh UCSB graduate, proceeded to give me a tour of the multi-unit space. “The owner is a surfboard shaper and he rents out different spaces for artists. There are a couple shaping bays, rooms for painting and this is our studio,” Johansson said. He wrenched open a large yellow barn door to reveal a clutter of keyboards, drums pieces and punky pop art.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The band cranked into a hard and fast Misfits set and blasted off the iconic punk song “Dig Up Her Bones<em>.</em>” Johansson jumped back into the studio to finish the beautifully horrific punk tune. Drummer Ethan Gordon hit the last crashes, cracked the snare a couple more times and then ended the song with the help of a righteous power chord from the lead guitarist and band founder Chris Vallee. As I listened, I remembered why the band is called Snakefist: their music punches you in the face.</p>\n<p>The band filtered out of the sweaty jam room, Gordon lit a cigarette and stood in the doorway as Johansson lazily tossed some newly made flyers my way. “Check these out,” he said. “I mashed up old horror movie posters with our logo for our Halloween show. It’s going to be all Misfits,” he grinned. “All Misfits?” I asked.</p>\n<p>Zac Stokell, the lead singer, perked up and said, “All Misfits! It’s gonna be sick man. You should come down — It’s going to be at Whiskey Richards!” Stokell stood over me, tall, lanky and shirtless with an energized and innocent smile exemplifying the charisma of a true frontman.</p>\n<p>Whiskey Richards is Snakefist’s original stomping grounds and it always gets rowdy when they play. “How would you describe a typical show at Whiskey Richards?” I asked Vallee as he slumped into the seat next to me on the tiny sofa. Vallee was shirtless, his hair coming out from underneath a black cap and falling off his shoulders.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just say that when we play Whiskey they hire extra security,” laughed Vallee. Snakefist shows are notorious for their madness and it’s very common for security guards to move audience members out of the way to break up fights in the mosh pit, clean up broken beer glasses or to make sure the girls dancing on the bar don’t fall off.</p>\n<p>“We want people to have a good time, basically I just want to make music for people to party, fight, or fuck to. That would be insane if people did that to my music,” said Vallee with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>The band’s honesty was juxtaposed by a healthy and humorous life philosophy: a philosophy without fear. Vallee especially understands fear because a little over a year ago he was looking death in its pupils. “What is that scar from?” I asked, referring to the scar that went horizontally underneath his pectorals and straight down to his naval creating a large cross on his torso.</p>\n<p>“I had a double lung transplant. It was either get surgery or die, so I chose surgery. I had cystic fibrosis or CB,” said Vallee. “Once you’re that close to death you’re not really afraid of anything anymore.”</p>\n<p>That attitude seems to work because in the last couple years Snakefist has played with some big names such as Red Fang, Five Finger Death Punch and the very band they are playing tribute to this Halloween: The Misfits. In addition to playing with the heavy-hitters of the metal scene, Snakefist recently got back from a full Midwest tour and played the music festival Rocklahoma.</p>\n<p>“Going to weird random places was super cool, like we went to this one bar in Arkansas and these guys were telling us that all these murders go down on this one road because it just goes on forever, you know, so people dump bodies or whatever … We were tripping out. It’s the most random places [where] you come back with the craziest stories,” said Gordon.</p>\n<p>Snakefist’s experience on tour and growing popularity has pushed them to realize how small Santa Barbara is in the worldwide music scene. “We’re moving to LA very soon, we need a bigger pond,” said Stokell. The band nodded in accordance, self-aware and honest about where they are and where they are going. “I mean we have a lot of work to do, we’re not fucking Guns ’n’ Roses,” said Vallee. “I mean not yet at least.”</p>\n<p>Although Snakefist may be leaving Santa Barbara, they were adamant that they would bring pure bone crushing rock back to the coastal city even after the move. But if you want to see them before they’re big and famous and experience something downright invigorating, be sure to catch Snakefist this Halloween downtown at Whiskey Richards.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Snakefist will play Whiskey Richards on Oct. 31 at 10 p.m. for 21+ only.

Let me preface this by saying I love dogs and don’t condone killing puppies to make coats, but still, I have to respect Cruella for her great fashion taste and boss attitude. Throughout the film, Cruella had a clear (okay, diabolical) goal and a set plan in mind to get things done. Rather than doing the dirty work herself, she employed two dowdy men to do the job and carried on her life of luxury and extravagance. For the most part, Cruella was the perfect picture of an independent woman with class and elegance, and she had an awesome collection of furs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HANNIBAL LECTER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sophie Felice Ho, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Let’s talk charisma. In fact, let’s talk Hannibal. Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Protagonist in the third of a series of suspense novels, this cunning, cultured and multilingual psychiatrist not only delves in the brains of his mental patients — he eats them as well. He’s a cannibal with such class that he prepares gourmet meals from his victims’ flesh, served with a side of fava beans. He’s a master of irony, the man behind the chillingly-charming apology, “I do wish we could chat longer, but I’m having an old friend for dinner.” Besides the fact that he intends to literally have his old friend as dinner, his penchant for wordplay and courteous demeanor fools us all. Hannibal stands most intriguingly terrifying in my world of horror, luring victims in until it’s far, far too late to escape.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HEINZ DOOFENSHMIRTZ</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Erika Lee, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, the scatterbrained and forgetful evil scientist from “Phineas and Ferb,” is my favorite villain. A hilariously nonthreatening character, Doofenshmirtz is never taken seriously by any of the characters throughout the show. His one-sided rivalry with Perry the Platypus and his sinister plots to take over the tri-state area (that do not ever seem to succeed) never fail to entertain audiences of all ages. After it is revealed that the reason he creates his schemes and inventions is caused by the lack of recognition and love from his unhappy childhood, he becomes a more relatable and likeable character. What makes Dr. Doofenshmirtz so different from other villains is the fact that he’s not actually evil; he’s a human being with insecurities of his own. It also helps that his accent and famous line, “Curse you, Perry the Platypus!” is pretty fun to imitate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">SHAN YU</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kelsey Tang, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fortune, beauty, love — these are typical goals that villains seek. Shan Yu of the Disney classic “Mulan,” however, seeks power. And in order to seize that power, he looks for complete annexation of China. What makes Shan Yu a respectfully cruel villain is his blindness to gender roles in a traditional, rigid setting that prohibits women from enlisting in the army. He recognizes Mulan as an equal opponent in strength and wit during a time period ridden with strict gender conventions. Shan Yu of the Huns, although unforgiving and brutal, still acknowledges Mulan’s capability. I’m impressed by his forward thinking, and I’m sure Mulan tacitly appreciated the acceptance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE DALEKS</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Mackenzie Hart, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!” Anyone that follows the longest running sci-fi show of all time, “Doctor Who,” will recognize that this signature chant originates from the almighty villain of outer space: the Dalek. The Daleks are a strangely cute and simultaneously pesky race of cyborgs whose arms are composed of a plunger and a whisk that shoots lasers. As adorable as they sound, they are not the best kind of people — the reason why the Doctor is the last Time Lord alive is because the Daleks killed off all of the others, including his family. Although they appear to be relentless and stone-cold serial killers, it is revealed in an episode that they are not as inherently evil as they seem — underneath a Dalek’s armor is a little, lonely organism that has feelings too. They may be easy to hate; but as misunderstood little critters, they are hard not to like.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chinelo Ufondu, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For many, Oct. 31 is a night filled with mischievous bliss and candy-toting children amiss, but for one it was the night where everything was destroyed. He was the most powerful, devious, sassiest dark wizard the world had ever seen. All cowered in his name — I urge you to not say it, for it could be the very last thing you utter. Those that dared to think he was vanquished clearly doubted the clever mind of You-Know-Who, who had a backup plan of survival and broke his immortal soul into pieces. Voldemort was a cunning badass of a wizard, equal parts smart and evil.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">YZMA</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Phi Do, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flashy, bold and eccentric, Yzma from Disney’s “The Emperor’s New Groove” is always hatching grand schemes to get what she wants. One of her first plans to kill the emperor was to turn him into a flea, put him in a box, put that box in another box, mail that box to herself and smash it with a hammer (though she eventually settles for poison to “save on postage”). A woman of power, Yzma will go through great lengths to reach her goals, even when she gets dumped in a pile of jungle slime. She’s a woman of spunk who has her own roller coaster leading straight to the lab, as long as she presses the right lever, that is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">MAN RAY</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alexandra DeSanto, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ma-ma-ma-MAN RAY! The most evil villain in all of Bikini Bottom has his own place in my childhood. The red and blue villain has his most famous scene when Spongebob and Patrick are watching over the lair of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The best friends try to teach Man Ray to be a good person, resulting in Patrick dropping his wallet as a test. After grabbing the wallet and trying to hand it back to Patrick, Man Ray is refused repeatedly by Patrick, who claims, “Nope, not my wallet.” The exasperation on the face of the villain will forever have a place<br>\nin my memories, along with the giggles of me and my sister.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE JOKER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alec Harnett, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My villain of choice would have to be from the adventures of my favorite comic series hero, Batman. Initially I would probably side with Mr. Freeze, but Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker in “The Dark Knight” wins. The Joker is more menacing than the Riddler, a mysterious villain who sent dangerous gifts to his opponents, on which he would attach a small riddle that usually led to figuring out what the “present” was. Although similar in theatrical flair, the Joker is a crueler character; you do not know what’s coming until it’s already occurred and there is no way to stop him unless something extraordinary happens; at least the Riddler would leave a clue to let you know what was coming.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">FRED FIGGLEHORN</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alex Wehrung, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fred Figglehorn in “Fred: The Movie” is one of the most defined villains in recent cinema: a stalker suffering from possibly schizophrenic hallucinations who will stop at nothing to get the girl he lusts after: Judy. What he intends to do when he “gets” her remains a mystery throughout the film. Fred is a truly terrifying presence. His high-pitched, constantly-screeching voice strikes terror into the hearts of his enemies and generally confuses everyone else.  He also demonstrates sociopathic tendencies when he pretends to invite people to his party, only to tell them they are not actually invited purely out of spite.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">RICHARD III</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Audrey Bachelder, Artsweek Editor</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Machiavellian Richard III is one of Shakespeare’s greatest masterpieces: a villain so criminally awful that it is almost seductive. Described as a horrifically hunchbacked man, Richard is grossly deformed and cannot walk “straight in front of a nymph.” So it’s a wonder that he is able to woo the beautiful Princess Anne, widow of the Prince of Wales whom Richard murdered.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At first, Anne essentially tells Richard that he should go to hell, and Richard responds that he is fit for one more place: her bedchamber. He proceeds to tell her that her beauty kept him awake at night, and it forced him to kill her husband so that he might lay in her bosom for an hour. Anne, vain cat she is, unravels under the compliments, and she becomes a missus to the murderer.

Neither did I until I watched “It.” Originally a TV-miniseries, this faithful adaptation of the book by Stephen King will leave you keyed up and on edge throughout its three-hour run time. “It” is a thriller-mystery following seven kids and later seven adults as they try to come to terms with supernatural events surrounding a killer clown named Pennywise. Ghouls and terrifying creations abound, and the movie’s theatrics are sure to make you look down every drain and up every spout. And, if you are worried about the movie running late, don’t worry. You’re not going to be sleeping anyway. Note: Coulrophobia refers to fear of clowns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9 Hours to Midnight —</strong> <strong> “The Conjuring” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>Released with the likes of “Carrie” (2013) and “Dark Skies” (2013), “The Conjuring” is probably the best horror movie released in the four years since “Haunting in Connecticut” (2009). In spite of stiff competition and an atmosphere of rehashed movie topics in Hollywood, this movie has done wonders at the box office. Although the plot lacks in originality, the twists and the apparition makes this movie a must-see. Bone-chillingly fresh suspense keeps the pace of the movie onwards. Pro Tip: Conjure yourself an extra pair of pants before watching; you will need them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16 Hours to Midnight — “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>It’s with happy <em>schadenfreude</em> that I present to you “The Hills Have Eyes.” Set in the Mojave Desert, a family of seven are hunted by a group of mutants looking for flesh and blood. This slasher/psychological thriller shocks the mind with grotesque violence and moments of adrenaline-fueled mayhem. Like any good horror movie, it strains against the limits of civility and pushes away common decency in a terrible display of death. Note: <em>Schadenfreude, </em>a German term, translates to “harm joy,” or pleasure at another’s misfortune.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12 Hours to Midnight — “The Blair Witch Project” (1999)</strong></p>\n<p>Arguably the film that created the ‘found films’ genre of horror, “The Blair Witch Project” is a cult film in its own right. Its plot centers on a group of college students who enter the Maryland forest with cameras to track down the legendary Blair Witch, only to disappear. An investigation ensues and the main evidence discovered is the cameras. The story and unknown forces that haunt these students all add to the film’s scariness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8 Hours to Midnight — “The Shining” (1980)</strong></p>\n<p>How many times have you heard someone make a reference to this film in the last week? One time? Two times? Five times? This movie has thoroughly infected the horror genre’s consciousness. Led by legendary film director, Stanley Kubrick, this Stephen King novel-adapted movie is about a couple and their young son taking a winter vacation up in the Colorado mountain ranges to manage the Overlook Hotel. The story, albeit very unfaithful to the original novel, nevertheless haunts audiences throughout the world in its depiction of the Overlook Hotel. The characters are strong and the setting isn’t lacking in creepiness. The lack of detail and resolution sets a mysterious vibe that is difficult to shake off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4 Hours to Midnight — “Mama” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>“The Ring” (2002) meets “The Grudge” (2004) in “Mama.” Directed by master of horror Guillermo del Toro, “Mama” is about two girls that are discovered in a cabin in the woods four years after their father abducted them. Their uncle and his girlfriend take them in as adopted daughters, only to find that something else has also been invited in as well.</p>\n<p>“Mama” has a moving plot and a great character cast. Far from being simple props that get horribly slaughtered, the characters elicit sympathy and pity for their misfortunes. Of course, like any horror thriller, the tension is racked up constantly in the melancholy setting. Note: “Game of Thrones” fans, if you ever wanted to see Jaime Lannister take on creepy ghosts, then this is the film for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Midnight — “Silent Hill” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the video game that sparked the genesis of the Western horror genre, “Silent Hill” is responsible for multiple game adaptations, including one produced by Guillermo del Toro expected to be released in 2016, and another movie sequel, “Silent Hill Revelations” (2012). Not to be confused with the slasher-thriller, “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006), “Silent Hill” (2006) is about a mother who takes her adopted daughter up to the mountains of West Virginia. In her journey, she accidentally ventures into an otherworldly, surrealistic dimension, to find her daughter in Silent Hill. Full of occult-ish creatures, pyramid men and dead nurses, this movie is chock full of frightening twists and turns that will leave you unable to stay still. The visual special effects are spot-on and the atmosphere is sure to haunt you on foggy days. Take this journey down Silent Hill and you’ll never regret it — until you can’t sleep, of course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through this journey, I hope you learn all the twists and turns of your deepest nightmares. No doubt, if you follow this list, you will find yourself screaming in terror. Try not to regret the nightmares or the creepy feeling of being watched that will undoubtedly follow — be one with your dark passenger.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Choi will be watching all of these movies in the dorms of Montecito House. He suggests you knock three times, pause, then knock again to be invited in.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/","id":6052,"author":{"id":753,"name":"Jon Choi"},"related":[6051,6050,6049],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Netflix Horror Films: The Horrifically Bad","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Picture your upcoming Halloween night.

What do you envision yourself doing? Are you dressing up in that “sultry spirit” costume (who knew being a ghost could be so revealing?) and lurking amongst your drunken peers in Isla Vista? Or are you opting for the not-so-wild alternative of curling up in your lofted bed to watch a horror movie? If your answer was more like the latter, then a Netflix horror movie is probably in your future.</p>\n<p>But let’s remember that this is Netflix we’re dealing with here: a streaming website that is 20% decent content and 80% god awful, low-budget flicks. Although the lack of selection may be positively scary, do not fear — this list will be your guide on what to avoid.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>“Grave Encounters”</strong></p>\n<p>This film encompasses all clichés of American horror: an abandoned asylum at night, endless jump scares and mind-bogglingly stupid characters. The movie begins with Lance Preston, the star of the fictional Ghost Hunters copycat TV show “Grave Encounters,” and his crew locking themselves in a haunted psychiatric hospital for the night. Little do they know that when they locked themselves in, they sealed their grisly fate. “Grave Encounters” is certainly one of those horror movies whose characters deserve what they have coming for them (isn’t it common sense to not stand next to a bathtub full of blood?), but I have to admit that this film is just as good as it is bad. Guilty pleasure status? I’d say yes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/HEmuFgHZZK0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HEmuFgHZZK0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Paranormal Activity 4”</strong></p>\n<p>The “Paranormal Activity” series could have maintained its dignity if it was not for this fourth installment. Riding on the coattails of the previous three movies, “Paranormal Activity 4” was both largely anticipated and largely disappointing. Its contents are cheap jump scares, a lazily put together plot and a girl that looks kind of like Dakota Fanning. That last detail is probably the most memorable part of the movie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Children of the Corn”</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to like this one for Stephen King. I really did. But it is kind of hard to take a movie seriously when the killers are small children that speak like they are from the 19th century and the lead villain is a ginger with an awful middle part. Indeed, “Children of the Corn” revolves around a small town taken over by children that kill anyone over the age of 18. A couple (both over the age of 18) find themselves trapped here while on a road trip, and as predicted, find themselves fighting for their lives. A word of warning: if you decide to watch this, you may never look at corn the same way ever again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Children of the Corn 3: Urban Harvest”</strong></p>\n<p>I guess I just couldn’t get enough of the first “Children of the Corn.” This film opens to a scene of a crazy Amish father chasing after his sons in a corn field. Little does he know that one of his sons is a prophet of a demon that resides in the corn, because that son quickly summons the demon and the corn kills the father. Yes, apparently vegetables can be deadly. The rest of the film follows the corn-demon-prophet-boy as he begins to terrorize his new foster family. Complete with (bad) early nineties special effects, “Children of the Corn 3” is somehow even cheesier than the original. Overall, this installment was bad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“The Human Centipede”</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of those movies where I read the synopsis beforehand to see if I could mentally handle it, only to come to the conclusion that I really would not be able to. Aside from that, this is certainly one original movie. No other movie parallels. If that makes you want to watch people’s mouths get sewn to each other’s buttocks, then be my guest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/S5CxpGKNuioframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/S5CxpGKNuio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Rodentz”</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think much needs to be said for this movie. Anything that features a “z” at the end of its title should not be trusted. Period.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There you have it: a list of horror flicks that may possibly put you at the risk of a brain hemorrhage. But do not give up hope — this is only the tip of the Netflix iceberg. So many other under-the-radar flicks lay in wait for you on your Halloween night.

Here are five songs to get you in the spooky spirit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Mind Playing Tricks on Me” by Geto Boys</strong></p>\n<p>Southern rap group Geto Boys, comprised of rappers Scarface, Willie D and Bushwick Bill, caused widespread paranoia in 1991 with their classic “Mind Playing Tricks on Me.” The track begins with an eerie bang. Rapper Scarface begins his verse with the line “<a href=\"http://rap.genius.com/22697/Geto-boys-mind-playing-tricks-on-me/At-night-i-cant-sleep-i-toss-and-turn-candlesticks-in-the-dark-visions-of-bodies-being-burned\">At night I can’t sleep, I toss and turn / Candlesicks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned</a>,” and it only gets creepier from there. The song is appropriate for this time of year, as Bill lets the listener know, “this year Halloween fell on a weekend/Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treating.” As you can imagine, their outing doesn’t end with bags of candy, but rather bloody knuckles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/KutXyPEEbQsframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/KutXyPEEbQs\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Heads Will Roll” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong></p>\n<p>This track might be upbeat and heavy on the synthesizer, but don’t be fooled — the song is actually about decapitated dancers and glitter blood. Don’t believe me? Check out the music video for this gory number. It follows a wickedly smooth dancing werewolf as he entertains an audience, and then swiftly murders them all in a flurry of red confetti and flashing lights. Disturbing? Yes. Perfect for a Halloween rager? Also yes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/auzfTPp4moAframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/auzfTPp4moA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Monster” by Kanye West (feat. Rick Ross, Bon Iver, Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj)</strong></p>\n<p>From the moment the song starts, listeners know they’re in for a treat. That’s because this West-produced party-starter wastes no time scaring its audience. Bon Iver has just enough time to sing the lines “Oh just another lonely night / Are you willing to sacrifice your life?” before a high-pitched shriek engulfs the track and makes the transition to a high-energy, fast-paced beat.

That’s right, because as hip hop group Whodini declares on their 1984 hit, the freaks come out at night. You’ll be too busy dancing to this funky hip hop classic to scour the crowd for the freaks, but take the songs outro as fair warning: “If you wanna live a nice quiet life / Do yourself a favor, don’t come out at night.”</p>\n<p><strong> <a href=\"http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/JLYC7ltxOrkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JLYC7ltxOrk\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>“Disturbia” by Rihanna</strong></p>\n<p>What do you get when a pop princess goes goth? Surprisingly, you get the perfect Halloween-themed song to get zombie-like guests moving. A chart-topper when it was released in 2009, “Disturbia” is still an absurdly danceable track, one with creepy undertones and an even creepier music video. Highlights include “It’s a thief in the night to come and grab you / it can creep up inside you and consume you,” and “Am I scaring you tonight?” Yes Rihanna, you are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/E1mU6h4Xdxcframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/E1mU6h4Xdxc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><em>Elena Bernick would like everyone to know she won’t be blasting “Monster Mash” this weekend.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-your-mothers-monster-mash-a-party-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-your-mothers-monster-mash-a-party-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-your-mothers-monster-mash-a-party-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-your-mothers-monster-mash-a-party-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-your-mothers-monster-mash-a-party-playlist/","id":7636,"author":{"id":759,"name":"Elena Bernick"},"related":[7635,7634,7633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cherub Headlines New Noise: Drugs, Sex and Indie Pop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Doses and Mimosas” first infiltrated the speakers of Isla Vista in 2012.

It was easily one of the biggest anthems of the year, along with the overplayed “Feel So Close” and horridly catchy “Call Me Maybe.” For some reason “Doses and Mimosas” never got old for me (can’t say the same about you, Carly Rae Jepsen), and it was super groovy to see the act behind the song live. Last Sunday, Oct. 19, Cherub sparkled as the headliner of the Block Party, the last hurrah of this year’s New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, I caught up with Josh Ocean of Ghost Beach, who preceded Cherub. Ocean was a generous conversationalist, complimenting the band onstage and pondering musical ideas out loud. He told me he liked my floral headband (made of fabric scraps from a booth at the front of the Block Party), so I gave it to him. He immediately put the purple mangled mess over his bleached blonde hair and gave me an appreciative high five.</p>\n<p>Ocean is the vocals and synth master of Ghost Beach, a Brooklyn-based electro-pop duo. They’ve been on tour with Cherub for the last eight weeks after the two groups met in London. “It’s been so crazy [being with them],” said Ocean. I pressed him for details, to which he took off his robin egg blue shades, widened his eyes and said, “Use your imagination.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kelly classic “Bump ‘n Grind,” the two men who form electronic pop band Cherub danced their way to the stage, only to become wary of the crappy sound system and shortened time slot. This was around 6:48, and Cherub was the last of six bands to close out the weekend. Unfortunately for the disco pop duo, the venue’s monitors were faulty, and they ran into timing issues for the rest of the show. Thankfully, spirits were running high through the crowd, and Cherub made the best of the unlucky circumstances.</p>\n<p>The duo, which consists of bassist Jordan Kelley and guitarist Jason Huber, were super attentive to the audience, singling out people in the crowd and giving a shout out to an old friend named Matt who they tried all the drugs with back in the day. If there was one thing that Cherub made clear on Sunday, it was that they love their drugs and sex. Of course, anyone who has mildly creeped on their social media would be able to tell you that. According to Facebook, they’ve got a “common goal to share a little bit of sex, a little bit of drugs and a whole lot of love with people across the globe.”</p>\n<p>“I wanna see more clouds,” said Kelley, referencing the marijuana and cigarette fog that floated above the 400 person crowd. Kelley began several anecdotes onstage, only to continue singing under the pressure of time. So he truncated the storytelling with little snippets like, “This song is about casual sex,” and “This song is about doing a lot of cocaine in the bathroom stall.” It was obvious that Kelley wanted to charm the audience more with his potent soliloquies; under the circumstances, he did what he could.</p>\n<p>In an act that demonstrates Cherub’s all-night-long attitude, Kelley cordially invited everyone to an after-party at EOS Lounge, yelling that even though the noise ordinance at the Block Party was at 8 o’clock, “We are going to play music until we all black out.” Drunken college kids cheered, waved their arms back and forth and made out with the stranger next to them.</p>\n<p>Cherub sang new tracks from their latest release <em>Year of the Caprese</em>, including “&lt;3 (Heart),” “Do the Math” and “Disco Shit.” They fed the audience the old stuff — “XOXO” from <em>MoM and DaD</em> and of course the classic champagne showers song that got them so popular in the first place, “Doses and Mimosas.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the show, Kelley and Huber were looking pretty knackered, both sweating profusely with their hair hanging in strings. But their eyes were still ablaze, especially when they did a duo guitar solo together. “Hey,” said Kelley. “You guys are the best — what day is it? — best Sunday crowd we’ve ever had!”</p>\n<p>When the best Sunday crowd Cherub ever had screamed for an encore, Kelley and Huber came back onstage, only to have their mics cut off. If this was any other band, they would have gone back to the hotel, complained about the shortened time slot and knocked out in preparation for more shows in L.A. But this is Cherub, and true to their lyrics, they kept the party going at EOS Lounge; after all, “it’s all overrated/except drugs and alcohol.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57561\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1352025362\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57560\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57561\" data-attachment-id=\"57561\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/cherub-headlines-new-noise-drugs-sex-and-indie-pop/cherub-at-new-noise-sb_kenneth-song_for-10-22-2014-2191/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413745748\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cherub at New Noise SB_Kenneth Song_for 10.22.2014-2191\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-57561\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57561\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/8h3t2h4NKPYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8h3t2h4NKPY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A print version of this story appeared in the Daily Nexus on Thursday, Oct. 23.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The woman turned to her two friends and buckled her knees like a teenager swooning that the lead singer of L.A.’s indie rock band Dawes gave her such a generous display of affection.</p>\n<p>Around her, 200 people of every generation mouthed lyrics to “Time Spent in Los Angeles.” It was a grand sight to behold: grandmas, moms, dads and pre-teens gathered together, everyone knowing words to the familiar songs and eager to take in new tracks.</p>\n<p>Dawes has been around for quite a bit — officially a band on Wikipedia for 5 years in 2014 — and judging from Friday’s New Noise Music Festival performance at SOhO, they’ve amassed quite the following. Granted, their fan base is pretty close by in L.A., but it must’ve been nice to have so many admirers take the drive up the 101 to catch a hometown hero act.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The particular song SOhO sang along to was “Time Spent in Los Angeles,” a track off their second album <em>Nothing Is Wrong</em>. Its lyrics are as such: “You got that special kind of sadness/You got that tragic set of charms/That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles/Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms.” Wrap you in my arms? No wonder the lady gushed so hard.</p>\n<p>Taylor wasn’t the only Goldsmith who had the audience grinning in satisfaction. Behind him, his curly-haired brother Griffin rocked the drum set and sang harmonies to meld with Taylor’s folksong voice. Bassist Wylie Gelber later noted in an interview on the SOhO patio that “Griff might be a better singer,” to which Griffin stated, “But Taylor is THE showman, you gotta be ballsy to do what he does.”</p>\n<p>Griffin was presumably referring to Taylor’s insane guitar riffs. When Taylor ignores the microphone and focuses on the guitar, he goes into a trance. His eyes glaze ever, his teeth chew on his top lip and his body moves erotically, a motion that translates to the insane finger-plucking. He invited up a good pal who looked like a regular cowboy onstage to riff on “From a Window Seat,” from their latest album <em>Stories Don’t End</em>. The cowboy wore a toothy smile and a sense of control which contrasted Taylor’s glazed-over, out-of-this-world musicality.</p>\n<p>Also on set was keyboard extraordinaire Tay Strathairn, who got picked up by the Goldsmiths seven years ago. The other three have known each other on a daily basis for more than 10 years, and according to Gelber, they get along really well.</p>\n<p>“We do pretty good. We’re on tour so much that if we didn’t get along great it would be a nightmare. We literally have to spend every single day together. And back when we toured for seven years, it was just us in a van driving around the country.”</p>\n<p>Dawes’ car in those days was a black, 14-passenger van that they put 5,000 miles on. It was a brutal and magical time, with the constant driving through the night to get to the next show. “[We used to] drive from Des Moines to Chicago, and literally pull up to the venue, do a sound check, play and drive [off] to a new place,” said Gelber.</p>\n<p>Now Dawes has gotten beyond the days of switching off midnight drivers, and they’ve got enough clout to employ people. So it’s fun for them to play the small venues they used to with a proper crew to handle all the administrative business.</p>\n<p>“We played this exact place without a crew four years ago. Rolled up and used the guy who worked here to run our sound who never heard of our band,” said Gelber. “Now it’s so much more plush. We have a crew, we have a hotel, everything is dialed in. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Gelber, whose first name Wylie is pronounced like the cartoon coyote that chases after road runner, is a floppy-haired, laid-back guy. He explained that the purpose of the SOhO show and the mini-California tour Dawes embarked on was to practice their new songs, which will be released in a new album later this year.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are rehearsing in front of everyone … we’ve done it before in a rehearsal room and it start[ed] sounding weird and sterile,” said Gelber. “It’s much easier to figure out what works and what doesn’t when you’re playing at a show … you respond better at a show rather than when it’s the four of you.”</p>\n<p>The idea that this show was a “rehearsal” explains why each band member seemed to be in their own head onstage, figuring out particulars. While Taylor Goldsmith sang with a pick in his mouth and transported to another world on guitar, Wylie Gelber’s tall frame reclined on the speaker, as if playing the bass on a bed at home. Griffin Goldsmith kept the tempo alive on drums, but even he closed his eyes behind wire-frame glasses. Tay Strathairn kept to the keyboards and experimented with groovy Cuban beats.</p>\n<p>The four individuals blended together beautifully, and although the set included many new songs, their loyal fan base swayed in appreciation. “This really means the world to us,” Taylor Goldsmith murmured. “Favorite show of the tour by far.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zwframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A print version of this story appeared in the Daily Nexus on Thursday, Oct. 23.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/","id":7635,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7634,7633,7632],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tour Bus Interview With G-Eazy Before Sold-Out Hub Performance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As I walked up the narrow steps of the white tour bus that was stationed behind the Hub, my eyes glazed at the lavishness of the interior of the vehicle.

In front of me was a lengthy figure sitting on crocodile-leather seats, wearing tight black skinny jeans, a plain black tee and a slick leather jacket. He stood up and extended his arm out to me to introduce himself. “Gerald,” he said, a sincere grin on his face. He offered me a drink and we sat down, turned to each other. Although I tried to play it off and act cool, I couldn’t help but tremble with nervousness at the surreal thought that I was about to interview G-Eazy for his sold-out show at the Hub.</p>\n<p>25-year-old Gerald Gillum, otherwise known as G-Eazy, is a popular rapper, songwriter and producer from Oakland, CA. His 2014 debut studio album entitled <em>These Things Happen</em> peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, as created by a skyrocketing demand for the young artist’s addictive hip hop beats and lyrical control. Having just launched his nationwide “From the Bay to the Universe” tour, the Oakland rapper hit Santa Barbara on only the fourth day — Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>G-Eazy discovered his passion for rapping at the age of 14. He explained the strong sense of determination he felt when he realized that rapping is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. “I just figured that if I’m going to do this, I want to do it and take it as far as I can go. I want to be a legend.” From what we can see today, this motivation has brought him to a successful music career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He continued to pursue his dedication to music throughout college. Having graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in music industry studies in 2011, G-Eazy is well-experienced with balancing both music and school. “Moving to New Orleans brought in my horizons,” he said. “I met my manager there, as well as other driven, like-minded people. I feel like college really helped give me that extra push I needed to get me to where I needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Gaining inspiration from notable artists such as the Beatles, Drake, Kanye West, Tupac and E40, G-Eazy combines hip hop and R&amp;B melodies with oldies and rock ’n’ roll. “I draw little pieces from music and use those influences to create my own songs,” he explained, sipping on a cup of hot coffee. “I’ll really like how this kick-drum sounds in this song, or the way this particular synth sounds, or this kind of a cord-progression, or this kind of a melody. I just take little pieces from a bunch of different places and pull it all together.”</p>\n<p>Despite G-Eazy’s catchy tunes and hooking rhythms, there’s a lot more to artist’s songs than their musical components, and that’s where his lyrical abilities come in. An admirable lyricist, G-Eazy aims to showcase his helter-skelter-type life. “My songs are about lifestyle,” he said with a kind nod. “They’re about my reaction, my perspective and my outlook on the world.”</p>\n<p>G-Eazy’s lifestyle is definitely not a normal one. From traveling around the country to promoting his latest album, a break is the last thing on the rapper’s mind. When describing his current tour, he was excited to tell me how well it was going — even on its fourth day in. “This is the best tour yet, by far. It’s just an honor to be able to tour with somebody like E40 — he’s a legend and I grew up listening to him, so it’s a privilege to share a bill like that.”</p>\n<p>Feeling rather like a mere outsider looking in, I had to ask how it felt to have reached number three on the Billboard 200 chart. “It’s all validation,” he said. “When I work in the studio, it’s this lonely process of creating something. All you can do is just hope it works. You just hope that what you’re making is going to resonate with people and you hope that they’re going to respond and like it. And when stuff like sold-out shows or being on the charts happens … that’s the return. It’s like ‘oh shit, this worked.’” He seemed proud of what he was saying — confident in his journey as an artist and what he is capable of accomplishing.</p>\n<p>As the interview was coming to an end, I asked if he had any advice for UCSB students wishing to step into the music industry. While at first he comically replied “don’t do drugs,” he continued on a more serious note. “Start whatever it is you want to be before you graduate — don’t wait until after college. It takes a lot of years on the runway to get the plane off the ground,” said G-Eazy. “College is kind of like this safe bubble — you think it sucks, but the real world really sucks. I would take all my free time in college working on music so that by the time I finished, hopefully that plane would be off the ground and I could be doing music full time.” From what I can tell, his strategy worked.</p>\n<p>Before I knew it, my time with the rapper came to a close as he was called to do a sound check. The line outside the Hub nearly extended to Storke Tower, with many UCSB students ready to have one of the best nights of their lives. G-Eazy performed songs such as “Downtown Love,” “Lady Killers,” “Let’s Get Lost” and of course, “I Mean It.”</p>\n<p>While the crowd didn’t have that one-on-one experience I was lucky enough to have, G-Eazy was just as inviting and enrapturing onstage in the Hub as he was in the interview. Soon enough I realized that the Oakland native’s charisma and ability to connect with people is exactly why the world just can’t get enough of him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57513\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"536306097\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57513\" data-attachment-id=\"57513\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/geazy5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"780,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57513\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=556%2C370\" alt=\"Courtesy of hopelessthunder.org\" width=\"556\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>hopelessthunder.org</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/images1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1496610293\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><br>\n</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This quarter centers on the early works of director Martin Scorsese. Affectionately called the “John Lennon of the filmmaking industry,” Scorsese is one of the most influential directors and screenwriters in Hollywood. Some of his more recent credits include “Hugo,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Shutter Island.” The first event on Oct. 16 screened “Mean Streets,” followed by a post-screening Q&amp;A with screenwriter Mardik Martin and the producer of “Baghdad to Hollywood,” Ramy Katrib.</p>\n<p>With the combination of both a convenient location and the prestige of Scorsese, I expected the seats in Pollock Theater to be completely packed with eager and excited UCSB students. I was wrong. The audience, occupied by mostly middle-aged men and women and a handful of college students, barely filled Pollock’s 296 seats. Perhaps it would be a different story if the screenwriter of “Orange is the New Black” came instead.</p>\n<p>Martin and Katrib were introduced in the front of the room in standard procedure, after which the announcer commented, “Be prepared to ask some very, very provocative questions of Mr. Martin at the very end.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Originally from a rich family in Iraq, Martin moved to New York City penniless to avoid the draft and study at New York University. There, he met Scorsese and the two began to write and work on projects together. The other guest of honor, Katrib, is the producer of “Mardik: From Baghdad to Hollywood,” a film on Martin’s life and journey towards the American film industry.</p>\n<p>“Mean Streets” (1973) is a crime film that focuses on the difficulty of keeping morals straight in the midst of the sin and corruption of New York City. Main character Charlie, played by Harvey Keitel, must make a tough decision in choosing between his epileptic girlfriend Teresa (Amy Robinson), his self-destructive friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) or his dream of becoming an esteemed restaurant owner. At the end of this emotionally gripping movie filled with vigilantism, Charlie realizes that it no longer matters what decision he makes — he is a sinner no matter what.</p>\n<p>After the screening came the so-called provocative questions. After being asked how the artistry of storytelling has been advanced tremendously by the motion picture industry, Martin offhandedly responded, “That is an interesting question. I don’t think that I can answer that. 1932-62 was when the storytelling was actually magic. I still don’t know how it’s going to be solved.”</p>\n<p>It was rare and refreshing to see a renowned screenwriter admit that he didn’t know the answer to all the questions. He then humorously added, “I think its clear when you think about it. Feature filmmaking. This has been completely taken over by monsters, bloodsuckers and sons of bloodsuckers.” The audience erupted into laughter.</p>\n<p>He was asked more questions about whether the industry is focusing on films that are safe and financially successful rather than artistic: once again, a truly thought provoking question with no concrete answer. Martin responded, “I don’t know. If I did know, I wouldn’t be sitting here! I would be out here making a film!” The audience laughed once more, either confused or charmed by his honesty. Ten minutes before the end of the event, Martin noticed the drowsiness in the audience and amusingly told us all to go home.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s his old age or maybe he actually didn’t know answers to the questions, but from what I gathered at Pollock Theater, Martin doesn’t take himself too seriously. Breaking the stereotype that all filmmakers and screenwriters are pretentious and self-absorbed, Mardik Martin was a breath of fresh air. Funny and candid, he was not afraid to admit that even though he is a successful screenwriter, he doesn’t have to know everything.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/scorseses-mean-streets-screenwriter-comes-to-pollock/","id":6045,"author":{"id":746,"name":"Erika Lee"},"related":[6044,6043,6042],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Looking Back at American Idiot, 10 Years Later: 6 Facts about the Classic Rock Opera","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s been ten years since we first saw that white disembodied hand clutching the heart-shaped hand grenade tightly, almost as if it was for dear life.

I used to wonder whether the owner of that fist ever pulled the pin, but looking back at the impact and influence <em>American Idiot</em> has had on popular music in the past decade, I’d say he did. <em>American Idiot</em> by Green Day hit shelves on September 20, 2004, and is classified as a rock opera, or an album with a story, a concept originated by The Who.</p>\n<p>The album tells the story of a young punk who calls himself Jesus of Suburbia. Bored with small town life, he moves to the big city where he creates an alter ego: St. Jimmy, the cool, confident punk that Jesus has always wanted to be. He also meets a girl who he calls Whatsername and falls in love with her rebelliousness. The album was controversial at the time of its release, mainly for its charged political undertones and its criticism of the Bush administration and the mass media. In honor of the tenth anniversary of this classic album, here are six facts about <em>American Idiot</em> you may not have known.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>1. The famous album cover was inspired by a lyric in the album.</p>\n<p>The lesser-known track “She’s a Rebel” contains the line “she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>2. American Idiot</em> exists because of a studio theft.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Green Day was working on a record called <em>Cigarettes &amp; Valentines</em>, but when it was almost complete, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the album, the band decided that the theft was a sign that the album was not their best possible work. They started from scratch and <em>American Idiot</em> was born. Surprisingly, the songs were never leaked by the thief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Brandon Flowers of The Killers criticized Green Day for being anti-American.</p>\n<p>The Killers’ rise to fame coincided with the launch of <em>American Idiot</em>. But their singer, Brandon Flowers didn’t appreciate Green Day playing their songs overseas. He said the concert film <em>Bullet in a Bible</em>, filmed in the UK, offended him because Green Day was making America look bad in the eyes of kids in other nations. “Where do they film their DVD? In England. A bunch of kids screaming ‘I don’t want to be an American idiot,’” Flowers said. However, in 2013, Flowers apologized to the band for his comments during a The Killers concert at Wembley Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The album was adapted into a Broadway play in 2009.</p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> became a musical that used every song from the record as well as some songs from follow-up album <em>21st Century Breakdown</em>. The musical premiered in Berkeley in 2009 before debuting on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. The release of <em>American Idiot</em> marked the second time Green Day had been criticized for selling out.</p>\n<p>When Green Day first rose to fame with their third studio album, <em>Dookie, </em>in 1994, their friends and fans in the Berkeley underground punk scene ostracized them for signing to a major label. Ironically, many of the people that embraced them and the newly popular punk culture similarly lambasted the baned ten years later for their reinvented sound on <em>American Idiot</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. “Wake Me Up When September Ends” is not about 9/11, but the death of singer Billie Joe Armstrong’s father.</p>\n<p>In September of 1982, when Armstrong was 10 years old, his father passed away. After the funeral he ran to his room crying and locked himself inside. When his mother came to comfort him he said from behind the door, “Wake me up when September ends.” Of course, having been released in 2005 when the September 11, 2001 tragedy was fresh in people’s memories, Americans found the song even more potent and powerful, creating the common misconception.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/Ee_uujKuJMIframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Ee_uujKuJMI\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57509\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57509\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/","id":7632,"author":{"id":758,"name":"Arasch Blurfrushan"},"related":[7631,7630,7629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ukulele Wiz Jake Shimabukuro Plays UCSB’s Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Jake Shimabukuro holds many accolades, the least of which is being one of the first videos to go viral on YouTube.

His rendition of George Harrison’s “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” entitled “Ukulele Weeps,” garnered millions of views after it was posted on the site without his knowledge. A quick glance at the comments section demonstrates how impactful that video was. Messages like, “8 years later, it’s still one of my favorites” appear regularly. But it’s not just his incredible talent at the ukulele that keeps people coming back. Shimabukuro possesses an inherent likeableness and pure sincerity that was on full display during his performance at Campbell Hall last Thursday, Oct. 23.</p>\n<p>Based on the excitement of the crowd, it seemed Shimabukuro is well-known and well-liked in Santa Barbara. Energetic chatter and a general air of excitement danced in the audience. The crowd was built up of mostly older, well-dressed adults, but they were as excited as any kid about to see a great concert.</p>\n<p>The show began with a single light upon Shimabukuro, who strummed his ukulele serenely. Bassist Nolan Verner joined in to add some subtle low-end. Four tree-like stands holding stage lights rotated 360 degrees and flashed an impressive array of colors. These were used throughout the show to add an extra element of visual interest. As the song built up in complexity, more and more lights were added, changing color and rotating with the melody. The lights added emotional tone to each song throughout the concert</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Shimabukuro greeted the crowd with an, “Aloha, Santa Barbara!” to enthusiastic applause. It was clear he was as excited to be there performing as the crowd was to see him. He made shout-outs to many people throughout the night, including Arts &amp; Lectures management, donors, friends and family and the chefs at Arigato Sushi, all by name.</p>\n<p>“We did 140 shows in 140 cities this year,” he said. “It’s nice to have some cities that you really look forward to. Santa Barbara is one of those.” The affection was mutual; the crowd adored him and cheered ecstatically after every song.</p>\n<p>Shimabukuro’s energy was positively infectious. He jumped around the stage and made expressive faces as he played, entertaining the crowd with his antics. He fist-bumped Verner after almost every song and even fist-bumped the stage manager when he came out to give Shimabukuro a different ukulele. It was clear he was genuinely enjoying himself.</p>\n<p>The first handful of songs was mostly upbeat, original arrangements featuring both Shimabukuro and Verner. The combination of bass and ukulele produced a gorgeous, full-bodied sound. At one point, the ukulele master used a loop pedal to record himself playing a reverb-tinged chord progression, and then soloed over it with a screaming, guitar-like distorted sound on his ukulele. The lights flashed frantically as the crowd cheered for his impressive finger work.</p>\n<p>The middle of the set featured Shimabukuro on his own, playing a host of more traditional songs from genres around the world. These included traditional Japanese and Hawaiian tunes, as well as jazz standards. Shimabukuro’s skill and musicianship was undeniable.</p>\n<p>Verner rejoined Shimabukuro onstage for the last several songs. These were more modern and upbeat arrangements and included a cover of “In My Life” by The Beatles. Before the last song, Shimabukuro took the time to thank the crowd (again) for being there and supporting the arts.</p>\n<p>“Music isn’t just a universal language,” he said, “it’s the language of the universe.” He talked at length about the importance of music education, saying, “I’ve been drug-free my whole life and it’s because of this instrument.” He then closed the night with his famous cover of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” which earned a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>\n<p>The musical skill Shimabukuro demonstrated was breathtaking. Even more impressive, however, was his obvious passion for making people happy. This is an artist who truly believes in the power of music to change people’s lives, and who aims to bring that transformative power to his audiences. Perhaps it was this sincerity that the millions of people drawn to his 2006 video were (and still are) responding to. It certainly seemed to captivate the attendees at Campbell Hall last Thursday.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/puSkP3uym5k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57447\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/ukulele-wiz-jake-shimabukuro-plays-ucsbs-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57447\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/ukulele-wiz-jake-shimabukuro-plays-ucsbs-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/ukulele-wiz-jake-shimabukuro-plays-ucsbs-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/ukulele-wiz-jake-shimabukuro-plays-ucsbs-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/ukulele-wiz-jake-shimabukuro-plays-ucsbs-campbell-hall/","id":7083,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7082,7081,7080],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academy Award Winning Actress Diane Ladd Reminds UCSB to Fight For the Arts","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Thursday, Oct. 23 UCSB’s Pollock Theater was filled with film connoisseurs anxiously waiting to see award-winning actress Diane Ladd on the big screen and in person.

The room was overwhelmed with applause as we watched her name appear on the screen before witnessing her performance as Flo in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 film “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” Her on-screen delivery moved our hearts as expected, but it was her off-screen words of advice that challenged our minds.</p>\n<p>Ladd is a three-time Oscar and Emmy nominee and has earned an Academy Award for her many performances in film and television. She’s an accomplished actress, writer, director and author in addition to being a loving wife and mother. Her film résumé is untouchable and her roles are countless, but none of us can forget her performance as Flo in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Ellen Burstyn as Alice, a widow who travels across the country with her son in hopes of pursuing a singing career and starting a new life. Along her journey Alice meets Flo, played by Ladd, a rebellious waitress who serves meals with a side of sass. From telling Alice that unbuttoning her shirt will get her more tips to forcing Alice to woman up and make a decision, Flo is the friend that keeps it real and keeps us laughing. It’s no wonder Ladd won the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress for the role.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After watching the film, the audience rose to their feet to applaud the accomplished actress and welcomed her to the stage for a little Q&amp;A. Her charming Southern accent and witty speech wooed us again as she told us stories about her life and experiences working in the film industry. She told us about how she surprised the world with the miraculous birth of her daughter Laura after doctors told her it would be impossible. Laura Dern went on to follow in her mother’s footsteps and the two actresses have worked together in films such as “Wild at Heart” (1990) and “Rambling Rose” (1991).</p>\n<p>When asked what working with Martin Scorsese was like, Ladd replied, “Marty is one of the greatest directors that I have ever worked with before in my life.” She talked about how great it was working with a director who loves you because the director-actor relationship is like a marriage. “Marty’s a New York director and with New York directors, you don’t talk with them til’ after lunch!” she joked.</p>\n<p>Ladd and her daughter Laura work hard to bring back roles for women. “It’s very hard to get the men in the profession to read a film script written by a woman, especially one who is an actress,” she confessed. Ladd is working with Scorsese again in her upcoming film “Woman Inside,” which tells the story of Martha Mitchell during the Watergate scandal.</p>\n<p>Meeting Ladd and hearing her speak was truly an inspiration. The first thing she said to me after the Q&amp;A was that she liked my dimples and that her mother used to tell her that dimples were a sign that the angels kissed you as a baby! Could she be any sweeter?</p>\n<p>Her humor and kind spirit attest to her humility, her talent is unmatched and her passion is raw. Ladd reminded us, “Films bring great truth to human beings and bring opportunities for us to see ourselves.” She encouraged us to work hard and have faith in all that we do. And her humor is just as witty and clever in person as it is onscreen.</p>\n<p>Check out Diane Ladd’s organization for the promotion of education, culture and literacy called The Art and Culture Task Force.
