Students have had to motivate themselves to set aside rehearsal times and have been challenged to find new channels for creativity, but it is all part of the process, according to third-year dance major Tabitha Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been really helpful for me to find other creative outlets that I haven’t necessarily practiced before. Although I’m not feeling super motivated as a dancer, I’m trying to keep my body in shape by going to technique classes and doing yoga and pilates and stuff,” Stewart said. “But then, having other creative outlets like cooking or learning to play an instrument or drawing, I’m trying to just move my creativity in a different direction.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The dance department does not rely on GauchoSpace the way other departments do, so instructors are figuring out how to use the platform at the same time as their students. “They don’t know what we can see and what they can see, so that’s been rough,” Lousen admits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the unforeseeable global pandemic, all Spring Quarter 2020 productions have had to be canceled or rescheduled, which is disappointing for dancers who have devoted hours of their time each week to rehearsing and perfecting their performances. Even though these shows will not take place as planned, Stewart does not view the past year’s work as wasted time because of relationships she formed with her fellow dancers. “The community, the collaboration, it’s been so inspiring to work with them whether or not we got to perform it.” She also mentions that there is a chance that these performances will see the stage in the future, but everything is still up in the air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year dance major Colson Lynn says that he is making the best of the situation by taking advantage of the abundance of resources found online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so much out in the dance world right now that’s being offered for free. I’m taking classes with a bunch of different choreographers that I never would have had the experience otherwise because they’re all based in New York. Their classes are online and free, so I’ve been motivated to keep practicing by taking something new,” Lynn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between academic classes, rehearsals and performances, dance majors are used to having highly structured schedules, and for third-year dance major Amity Beardsley, the lack of structure to her day has been the most difficult aspect of online classes. “I personally need structure but I prefer when it’s laid out already. It’s been hard to get everything done on my own terms. Honestly, I don’t think I have as much work, but because I have a hard time getting motivated it takes me probably double the amount of time.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to many other majors, where classes are generally rather sedentary, the life of a dance major is defined by physical movement. With the stay-at-home restrictions, the hours spent in front of her laptop are less than ideal, says Lousen. Given the extra time, she makes it a point to explore other classes and activities in order to recalibrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of the obstacles that dance majors have had to navigate, many of them take comfort in knowing that they are a part of a close-knit community where everyone looks out for one another. Second-year dance and psychological &amp; brain sciences major Isabel Meena noted that several dancers formed a group chat called “Movers and Zoomers” once they realized that classes were going to be online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially during this when we’re all kind of struggling at home, it’s been really nice to at least know we can get in class with each other. The first Zoom meeting that we had, where I got to see all my friends’ faces on a computer screen, that’s better than nothing,” says Meena. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s administration has still not decided on how it will approach Fall Quarter 2020 instruction, but Stewart says that the dance department is pushing to get its students back on campus as soon as possible. “Our faculty is incredibly creative, obviously, and they have all these very creative solutions and ways that they could go about keeping us safe but still allowing us to dance.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If classes do not return to in-person instruction for the upcoming school year, however, many students are re-evaluating the decision to pay full tuition for remote instruction and are considering taking fall quarter off. Meena admits that she is not sure if virtual instruction is worth the challenges. “It makes me wonder, if classes end up being online in the fall, if I want to keep doing that to myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of COVID-19, students and faculty have been inspired to come up with creative solutions for what will ultimately just be a bump in the road for the department. In the meantime, these dancers will continue to lean on their passion for their craft as they look forward to hitting the dance floor with each other once again. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Dance</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past weekend, the UC Santa Barbara Department of Theater and Dance gave an exciting performance of “Hookman,” bringing the 2012 slasher comedy to life in the Performing Arts Theater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The production was an interesting challenge for Theater and Dance to tackle, combining both humor </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gore. Prior to its first showing on Saturday, director </span><a href=\"https://www.theaterdance.ucsb.edu/people/michael-bernard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Bernard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> expressed his optimism for the play’s reception, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/ucsb_department_of_theater_dance_presents_hookman_a_slasher_comedy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stating</span> </a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that he was “very excited about the way the play mixes comedy and horror. It’s full of surprises and is able to take on some pretty heavy issues in a way that is unexpected and refreshing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, “Hookman” is a play full of surprises. When Lexi, a lonely college freshman, travels back home to California for the holidays, she witnesses the death of her best friend, Jess, who dies in the passenger seat of her car during a fatal accident. Following this tragedy, Lexi returns to college in a state of grief, perturbed by Jess’s death — especially after she starts receiving threatening messages from a man who has a hook for a hand. (“It’s Hookman!” Lexi exclaims.)</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the very first act, “Hookman” is brimming with intensity, unafraid to broach dark topics and illustrate horrific scenes to the viewer. Lexi is not only in the grips of losing her best friend; she is haunted by her past in a way that makes the production dreadful to watch – and at the same time, all the more thrilling. The play’s impressive use of props, stage direction and music add to this effect, chilling the audience from the moment they are initially seated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the spookiness of “Hookman” is so pronounced, it at times detracts from the emotional impact of the play. While the horror elements of “Hookman” are incredibly gripping, some of the logistics are left unexplained to the audience, distracting from Lexi’s transformation as the play develops. The audience can only wonder: Who is Hookman? Is he a figure of Lexi’s imagination? And why is he so motivated to haunt Lexi in the first place? The play refuses to give a clear answer.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92992\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1443913952\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92991\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92992\" data-attachment-id=\"92992\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-21/theater-and-dance-brings-a-thrilling-performance-of-hookman-to-performing-arts-theater/hookman1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1518&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1518\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hookman1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?fit=888%2C658&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92992\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?resize=888%2C658\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1139&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hookman1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of David Bazemore</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These unanswered questions are initially puzzling, then frustrating for the viewer, particularly when one of the characters, Chloe, delivers a bizarre closing monologue to the audience. “I think the end is that we all die,” Chloe says, without much context. “That’s always the end, right?” Then, laughing maniacally, she skips off to the left stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While chilling, moments like these often go unexplained in “Hookman,” undermining the play’s exploration of loss, life and our relationships with one another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these loose ends, “Hookman” nonetheless proved to be a stunning performance, supported with a small but superb team of actors. Characters Yoonji (Gloria Huang) and Chloe (Ryan Hollon) are hilarious, embodying the stereotypes that are often associated with college students. Lexi (Blake Thompson) and Jess (Kat Cleeve) are also fabulous, reminding us all of the difficult emotions that often come with friendship: grief, bereavement and loneliness. The cast offers a raw portrayal of what it is like to be young, in college and on your own for the first time, reminding me of everything I felt when I was a freshman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Theater and Dance’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next production, Molière’s “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tartuffe,” will be performed in the Hatlen Theater from Feb. 27-29 and March 5-7.

weekend in the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, bringing a showstopper performance of the 1999 British musical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The musical was much anticipated by students and was met with a successful reception, achieving a nearly packed house on its Saturday showing. After four months of rehearsing, “Mamma Mia!” was unveiled as the company’s first show of 2020, executed with a skill that rivals the hit 2008 “Mamma Mia!” film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a film franchise that grossed over $144 million in its first installment alone, “Mamma Mia!” is a narrative so iconic that its plot hardly needs an explanation. Sophie, a 20-year-old bride-to-be, prepares for her wedding by sending invitations to three of her mother’s former love interests. After stumbling upon their names in a diary entry, Sophie realizes that her mother’s affairs with these men coincide during the time of her conception.

Christian Duarte, director and third-year student at UC Santa Barbara, pitched the idea to perform “Mamma Mia!” last year, wanting to produce a show that was more lighthearted than the company’s previous productions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Both of last year’s shows were sort of devastating in the experience of it all, just by covering such dark and heavy topics,” Duarte said in an </span><a href=\"https://newspress.com/life/2020/ucsbs-shrunken-heads-presents-mamma-mia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Santa Barbara News-Press</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wanted to do something that was really fun.” Duarte’s theatrical direction more than achieves this goal, with “Mamma Mia!” being far from a downer production. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, the musical is brilliantly cast, full of actors who exude the dramatic energy and vocal talent that originally brought “Mamma Mia!” to fame. At times, it is hard for the audience to believe that the musical is entirely student-run, looking at the sheer talent and attention to detail in the show’s choreography, set design and, of course, the singing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are going to be surprised by the caliber of a production that can be put on by a student group with virtually no money,” said Mikayla Knight, who plays Sophie’s mother, Donna. “This is all from scratch, this is a club, this is something that students are voluntarily rehearsing for three or four nights a week.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The troupe did not disappoint die-hard “Mamma Mia!” fans, giving impressive covers of tracks like “Money, Money, Money,” “SOS” and — most iconic of them all — “Dancing Queen.” When combined with eloquent dancing sequences, the show achieves a sense of idyllicism, which was what made “Mamma Mia!” so popular among millennials in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all the actors impress, third-year feminist studies major Kat Bautista deserves special mention on her own. Her portrayal of the wide-eyed, idealistic Sophie is superb. Bautista’s voice is simply beautiful, giving me chills as she sang “Honey, Honey” in the opening act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is quite the sight to see Sophie twirling through the island of Kalokairi in search of her father and to see the apprehension in Sophie’s mother, Donna, as she collides with her former love interests. Arguably, one of the best things about “Mamma Mia!” is that its plot is so fantastical in nature that the audience cannot help but wish it to be true.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shrunken Heads Production Company will be holding auditions for its next musical, “Xanadu,” from Feb. 19 to Feb. 23. While the original production of “Xanadu” was poorly received (receiving a 25% critic rating on </span><a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/xanadu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the upcoming musical lends a lot of creative direction to the Shrunken Heads crew, who will be taking a sharp turn from the whimsical “Mamma Mia!” production. Students who are interested in the “Xanadu” production may schedule a time slot for vocal and dance auditions on the Shrunken Heads </span><a href=\"http://shrunkenheadsproductions.com/auditions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92794\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/shrunken-heads-production-brings-a-stunning-performance-of-mamma-mia-to-uc-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92794\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/shrunken-heads-production-brings-a-stunning-performance-of-mamma-mia-to-uc-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/shrunken-heads-production-brings-a-stunning-performance-of-mamma-mia-to-uc-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/shrunken-heads-production-brings-a-stunning-performance-of-mamma-mia-to-uc-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/shrunken-heads-production-brings-a-stunning-performance-of-mamma-mia-to-uc-santa-barbara/","id":6523,"author":{"id":840,"name":"Jennifer Sor"},"related":[6522,6521,6520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Reminiscing Over the 2010s With These Iconic UCSB Shows","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2020-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SnoopDoog_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-41.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SnoopDoog_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-41.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Here’s a list of the best performances that have taken place here at UCSB over the last decade!","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Here’s a list of the best performances that have taken place here at UC Santa Barbara over the last decade (2010-2019)!</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Aoki (Jan. 8, 2010 &amp; March 31, 2011)</strong><br>\nUCSB alum turned DJ, Steve Aoki brought his beats back to Isla Vista for a free performance at the Hub.

Charles has taken an interest in Charlotte’s work, which exposes the everyday microaggressions directed toward African Americans.

Rankine poses the question to her audience: When speaking about race, should we be focusing on the people who are oppressed or the people who are the oppressors? In other words, is it in society’s best interest to talk about the black man who was shot or the white cop who shot him?</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91740\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"964465922\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91737\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91740\" data-attachment-id=\"91740\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/the-white-card-brings-full-house-to-ucsb-studio-theater/whitecard2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"whitecard2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-91740 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Martin Wong</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-act production seeks the answers to these questions and is better described as a debate rather than a traditional play. The entire show, which runs for an hour and seven minutes, lacks a substantial plotline, leaving the viewers to witness a heated argument on the issue of race between multiple characters. However, the lack of plot progression makes it hard for the audience to initially get invested, and in the end, Rankine’s argument-heavy script feels unfit for the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, watching the play feels exactly like being invited to a dinner party with the audience as the guests awkwardly observing a five-sided fight unfold. The characters bring up a series of political hot topics, which — in addition to being a dinner-party faux pas — forces the audience to think about issues that are uncomfortable to contemplate and even more uncomfortable to hash out, such as privilege, racial microaggressions and — the most uncomfortable of them all — white guilt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewers may also find it difficult to follow the characters’ debate as the dinner party escalates, with Rankine hurling artistic allusions, political references and sharp-witted rhetoric toward the audience at rapid-fire speed. The dialogue between characters errs on the clunky side, the script being full of non-sequiturs that make the overarching purpose of their conversations unclear: “Fantastic food surrounded by such beauty,” Eric (Cooper Von Bruhns) said. Alex (Johnathan Buhrer) is quick in his reply: “How can you talk about beauty when there are Nazis in the white house?”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91741\" style=\"width: 1387px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1799869747\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91737\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91741\" data-attachment-id=\"91741\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/the-white-card-brings-full-house-to-ucsb-studio-theater/whitecard-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?fit=1377%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1377,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"whitecard 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?fit=168%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?fit=689%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91741\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?resize=888%2C1321\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1321\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?w=1377&amp;ssl=1 1377w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?resize=168%2C250&amp;ssl=1 168w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1142&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whitecard-3.jpg?resize=689%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 689w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Martin Wong</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing provocations like these is as stressful as engaging in a debate yourself, which goes to highlight one of Rankine’s overarching points: Having an honest dialogue about race is uncomfortable for nearly everyone, a truth Rankine never lets the audience forget. As a result, “The White Card” is incredibly thought-provoking, portraying a sensitive, nuanced perspective on how race permeates throughout our society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the play is beautifully executed as the skill of the cast was palpable onstage. While there is little to no action in the play, the actors make up for this uneventfulness with raw displays of emotion, capturing the outrage that comes with having such tense conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stage direction was also quite masterful, with the characters’ conversation being interrupted by short, performative segments which add an extra layer of meaning to the production as a whole. As Charlotte argues with Charles, a red light descends onto the stage and the other characters circle robotically around her, caging the frightened Charlotte into a corner. The choice of lighting and stage direction gives the play a surreal quality in scenes like this, imploring the viewer to think more critically about race and the ways we as humans inadvertently estrange ourselves from each other. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

this past weekend. As expected, the play attracted a sizeable audience, with the first three showings bringing in a packed house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launch Pad, a program that secures professional playwrights to work alongside Theater and Dance students, produced the play under the guidance of Enid Graham. Graham, who is best known for her work as a Broadway and television actress, penned the script for “What Martha Did” in 2015. The play has since been honored at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center’s National Playwrights Conference and the American Blues Theater’s Blue Ink Playwriting Festival and is UCSB’s 15th Launch Pad production.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Graham humbly describes herself as an “emerging” playwright, that is far from the impression given in UCSB’s small black box theater. “I feel like I’ve hit the jackpot with Launch Pad,” Graham said in a press release regarding her workshopped production. “I feel really lucky to be having this experience in a place with so much talent and devotion to the process.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large and talented ensemble of a college BFA program is precisely what Graham needed to bring “What Martha Did” to life, a tragicomedy filled with complexity. Martha Fisher, played by Alexandra Singleton, takes her own life shortly after publishing a book of positive aphorisms. Her suicide is not only paradoxical but leaves her family and friends still reeling from the loss 25 years later. How do they reconcile Martha’s cheery, optimistic poems with her suicide? How do the other characters make peace with the fact that Martha is not the person others thought her to be — and in a sense, neither are they?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes the viewer some time to make sense of Graham’s complicated storyline. The audience is left disoriented for the first chunk of the play, tasked with stitching together a family history they can barely understand. That being said, the mental effort required to piece together the play proves to be a rewarding process for the viewer and communicates a larger point about grief: Losing a loved one is disorienting, and we may never be able to stop ourselves from going back to the past and trying to make sense of it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91434\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1977430367\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91325\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91434\" data-attachment-id=\"91434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/launch-pad-brings-an-exciting-performance-of-what-martha-did-to-ucsb/wmd2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WMD2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91434\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WMD2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of David Bazemore</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it is never clear to either the characters or the audience why Martha kills herself. The most haunting moments of the play are arguably the beginning and the end, in which a recording of Martha prior to her death is played for the audience. She describes her book of poems, which argue for the joy of being alive, as a “portrait” of what she once believed. Graham appears to be leaving an open-ended question for the audience: Is life always as joyful as it once seemed when you were young?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The circumstances of Martha’s suicide remain perplexing, but seeing her friends and family scrambling to host a dinner in her childhood home makes a poignant claim about growing up. Becoming who you really are is filled with pain, regret and listlessness. Evidently, it is an unavoidable process for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast is remarkably adept at portraying this truth, capturing a nuanced profile of a grieving family. The play is filled with stunning displays of emotions. Mrs. Fisher, played by Julie Fishell, throws her head back in a dramatic arc as she describes the family’s loss. There are too many moments like these to describe as every single one of the cast members delivers a rich, heartfelt performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sheer talent of the cast makes it hard to remember many of the actors are college students, which makes an interesting point in and of itself. The play speaks to the difficulties of growing up and reconciling with one’s past, which is precisely what the college-aged audience and cast members are going through themselves. The irony of “What Martha Did” is that it showcases the hardships of growing up through the very people in the midst of those hardships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the play speaks to college students because […] we all go off in our lives and we become the people that we become and then we come back to our families and they think that we’re 12,” Graham said in an interview with the Department of Theater and Dance. “How can we move on from the events of our past and blossom into adults around the people that remember us as children?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She poses an intriguing question to viewers of the play, particularly for those in the throes of their undergraduate years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB Theater and Dance production, “The White Card,” will play this weekend at the Studio Theater. “The White Card,” a drama that explores issues of art and race, will run a total of six times this weekend, with opening night scheduled on Thursday, Nov. 21 at 8 p.m. As always, tickets for UCSB students and alumni will be $13 pre-sale and $15 at the door.</span></p><div

MultiCultural Center to host Open Mic and an Evening of Self-Expression, available to anyone who wanted to express themselves through spoken word, poetry, music and dance. Despite the fact that there’s nowhere to park your bike at Biko, there was a full house with people pouring out of the garage filled with performers and audience members alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The garage itself shelters colorful lights, art-covered walls, a dazzling disco ball and couches that make you feel right at home. The material space creates an eccentric atmosphere that attracts even more eccentric people. As I arrived at this event, a crumpled piece of lined notebook paper was being passed around, already filled with scribbled names anxiously waiting to hear their cue to the stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MC for the night was the one and only Roni Walker, an LA-based poet who has been writing since age 7 and also works as an upcycled fashion designer. Prior to this evening, Roni has hosted different events for both the MultiCultural Center (M.C.C.) and Associated Students (A.S.) over the last 10 years. “I think it’s important that people have a platform to express themselves because there’s a lot of pressure in this world, especially being a student,” she said. “We need a diverse outlet where people are free to express themselves and no one is judging them.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since she didn’t personally know any of the performers, Roni ingeniously conjured up humorous introductions which kept the ambiance of the night cheerful and enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a wide variety of performances including spoken songs, original and well-known poetry, live music and a comedy set. All of the students were extremely brave as they showcased different talents like self-proclaimed “nerd” poetry, slam poetry, guitar playing and singing. One of my personal favorites of the night was Razine and the slam poetry recital of his original work “Poltergeist.” Before he began his performance he informed the audience, “I really don’t like ghosts,” and went on to speak with a satisfying rhythm the heartfelt line: “I was just the interlude and you were my whole album.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MC Roni described her favorite poet of the night to be a third-year environmental science major named Elleni Vasquez. “Her poem talked about her living in a house with her family members and living with the ghosts of living people. And it just really affected everybody, not just her.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In speaking with the M.C.C. Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh, I inquired about why the Biko Garage was chosen for this event. Sabbagh explained that Biko is a great environment to host the quarterly Open Mic because it aligns with “our mission statement” and its location in I.V. is “accessible to students.” When asked why she believes the Open Mic is an important event for students to express themselves, Sabbagh described how students “aren’t often given opportunities in a place where they can feel comfortable and safe to talk about issues and struggles they deal with.”</span></p>\n<p>With the cooperation of I.V.’s beloved Biko Garage, Gauchos were given a safe and supportive space in which they could express themselves and inspire others to do the same. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after a long day of class, attending the open mic proved to be an entertaining and worthwhile experience.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

stage of Campbell Hall on Saturday June 1. Hosted by Maddy Mokes and including performances by guests from UCSB and the surrounding area, the showcase was the epitome of what dance aims to be: supportive and uplifting. This aura of positivity was underscored by Urban’s charity of choice, Everybody Dance Now!, a nonprofit that teaches street dancing classes to youth who would not have such opportunities otherwise.</p>\n<p>The show began with some technical difficulties, yet the dancers maintained their composure and delivered a sharp rendition of their competition set, which expressed themes of patriotism and gratitude for freedom. And also booty shaking.</p>\n<p>The piece was loaded with jaw-dropping moments, including a particularly impressive whacking section and a backflip. With sound issues behind them, the team kicked off the show on a high note and hyped the audience up for the incredible performance to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Host Maddy Mokes espoused plenty of wholesome wisdom throughout the night, adding an endearing touch to the breaks between sets. At one point, Mokes told the crowd that she heard someone express their nervousness backstage. She stated that nervousness equivocates to caring and hard work, earning heartfelt “awwws” and cheers from the audience.</p>\n<p>The next UDC set showcased the talent of the first-years of the company. Adhering to the theme of monsters, the freshmen were able to showcase their specific talents and also their class’s overall collective technique and skill level. The second-years of Urban offered a more contemporary take on hip hop, which added a nice reprieve from hard-hitting pieces prior. With a mash-up of several Billie Eilish songs, including “You Should See Me in a Crown,” “Bury a Friend” and “Bad Guy,” the second-years brought a refreshing piece to the show.</p>\n<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was Ventura-based company Undeclared. While certainly fun-sized, this group of dancers ranging in age from four to 17 years old packed quite a punch. The kids brought the house down with their ferocious attitudes and excellent foundation of technique as well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88946\" style=\"width: 705px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1525633553\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88944\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88946\" data-attachment-id=\"88946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/urban-dance-company-ignites-campbell-hall/screen-shot-2019-06-05-at-9-02-01-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=1718%2C1260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1718,1260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 9.02.01 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=888%2C651&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM-1024x751.png?resize=695%2C510\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=1024%2C751&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?w=1718&amp;ssl=1 1718w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Urban Dance Company</p></div>\n<p>The show was filled with fun and funky highlights that were packed with personality and technical excellence. The UDC girls set paid tribute to the ’90s, full outfits and all. The core members — comprised of the director, artistic directors, team captain and other administrative roles on the team — performed an iconic tribute to Justin Bieber, outfitted in purple, reminiscent of Bieber’s earliest era.</p>\n<p>The UDC guys’ set was one of the most impressive of the night. It began very fluidly, with a smooth, R&amp;amp;B-backed piece with a seamless transition into a hard-hitting segment. The dancers showcased their diversity of talent within the many genres of hip hop in a very short amount of time. Yet what was perhaps most impressive was their willingness (and success) to play with stereotypical male gender roles, set to Lizzo’s “Boys,” of course.</p>\n<p>A prime standout moment of the show was the freestyle competition which included members of Urban as well as their guests. The competition epitomized the supportive and lighthearted nature of dance, particularly as all of the participants and audience members rallied around the youngest member of the competition from Undeclared, who — let’s be honest — absolutely killed it.</p>\n<p>Adding to the diversity of the show was Urban’s first-ever contemporary dance set. Set to Leon<br>\nBridges’ gorgeous ballad “River,” members of UDC expressed themes of community and victory while<br>\novercoming mental health struggles, something they noted that dance helps them achieve. The dancers<br>\nbeautifully conveyed these themes through their elegant and sophisticated set, which was both<br>\ntechnically and emotionally stunning.</p>\n<p>Year after year, Urban Dance Company continuously reminds UCSB why they are so phenomenal. In addition to their flawless technique, fun sets, song choices and amazing stage presence, they also continue to give back to their community. Whether it be an issue of mental health or children’s dance educations, they are always stepping up.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

The festival’s site description boasts that campers will be able to intermingle with their favorite DJs, as artists don’t hide behind “velvet ropes” at Dirtybird. In case you’re wondering, this festival will comprise of mostly house music DJs. I attended their cookout in Las Vegas two years ago and danced to house beats non-stop for eight hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Woogie Weekend</strong> in Silverado, Calif. is a three-day festival hosted by the Do-Lab in July. If you’re looking for a new Lightning in a Bottle, this is the festival for you. Woogie Weekend offers the same energy as the Woogie Stage from LIB and is spread out over the course of three days. While the festival provides less activities and lectures than LIB, it is sure to be a more intimate experience. Woogie Weekend attendees claim that this festival definitely gives off the same liveliness as an early Lightning in a Bottle experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Just Like Heaven</strong> is a festival in Long Beach (May 4); while it’s only a one day festival, its lineup is attractive enough to make the list. The festival features artists such as The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, MGMT, Passion Pit, Beach House and Neon Indian. This lineup throws me back to 2014’s most popular Indie artists, so if you want to please the dormant indie enthusiast inside of you, head to Just Like Heaven.</p>\n<p><strong>Shambala Music Festival</strong> in Canada. This festival has a max capacity of 11,000 (think 126,000 for Coachella). This August their lineup includes Troyboi, Zhu, FKJ, Zeds Dead and several other notable artists. The festival is located next to a beautiful river that attendees can swim in throughout the day.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t yet sold, take a look at their stage name; for example, in “The Fractal Forest,” you’ll be surrounded by tall trees and the sweet sound of funk music. It’s important to note that this festival is meat and fish free, plus a lot of their drinks are void of milk and their beverages aren’t sold in single-use plastic containers.</p>\n<p><strong>Solid Sound Festival</strong> is a little more low-key than Shambala with a capacity of around 7,000, but check it out if you’re planning on visiting North Adams, Mass. or neighboring cities this June. The whole festival is hosted by Wilco, who will be playing two sets at the festival. They also offer limited one-day passes for people who can’t make the whole weekend.</p>\n<p>I did some e-digging to find these festivals but by no means is it intended to be a comprehensive list. I also didn’t happen to add any hard-core EDM festivals to the list, but you can find those festivals aplenty both in and out of state.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

Created in 2012 as his inaugural work for the New York City Ballet, where he is currently a soloist and serves as Resident Choreographer, Peck manipulates conventional conceptions of ballet into a geometric sequence of bodily distortions. Set to Philip Glass’ “Four Movements for Two Pianos,” eight dancers interact with each other as well as the pianists to break the traditional mold of separation between dancers and musicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peck’s love of powerful lines emerged throughout the piece, as his dancers would frequently strike strong 90 degree angles with both arabesques more familiar with traditional ballets, as well as sharp, angular arm movements more in line with contemporary works. In spite of his youth, 31-year-old Peck is one to watch; many consider him one of the great up-and-coming choreographers of this century. The Joffrey’s choice to perform an experimental work by a wunderkind perfectly reflects their self-awareness as a progressive company struggling against the tide of antiquated norms and</span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/what-went-wrong-at-new-york-city-ballet\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scandals in American ballet companies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately after</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came Nicolas Blanc’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encounter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a sultry duet created specifically for the company. Blanc’s use of a sole prop and sparse costumes allowed the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative expertly woven by the dancers who performed it. At times it is unclear whether the presence of the female dancer is an apparition or whether Blanc intended for her to be a tangible figure, but this ambiguity does not deter from the feelings of raw, spine-tingling yearning evoked in the piece. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encounter </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was jazzy, sexy and smooth as the dancers effortlessly glided through jaw-dropping lifts, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penchés</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and acrobatics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brief intermission allowed the audience to catch their breath, only to have it quickly stolen back by Alexander Ekman’s show-stopping </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The curtain opened to a dancer in a headstand, guiding the curtain up with his feet as other dancers emerged in various styles.

A voice emerged through the speakers, pondering the meaning of joy, as more dancers filled the stage. “What if this piece is 30 minutes of this?” he asked to laughter.

At this point the dancers tied their pointe shoes at lightening-fast pace while the audience waited patiently, bobbing along to the rhythm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The female ensemble portion of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was just that: joyous. The women danced like a pack of wild gazelles, letting their hair fly and their personalities shine. They balanced on their pointe shoes and grooved to the beat (reminiscent of</span><a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/hiplet-hip-hop-ballet-dancers\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homer Bryant’s hiplet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and evoked the strongest aura of fierce, uninhibited girl power ballet has seen in a moment. Yet another highlight of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was the full company portion performed in heels (yes, even the men). The dancers fearlessly challenged conventions of gender and sexuality </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one notable moment included the impossible-to-miss Fabrice Calmels lip-syncing to Tiga’s “Shoes.” In spite of the theatrics of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, its wholesome message prevailed: we find joy within doing what we love and the people who surround us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mammatus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was likely the most aligned with the audience’s preconceived notions of contemporary ballet. Using the company to personify the formation of clouds, the piece exemplified a sense of organized chaos that so aptly explains the zany weather patterns Santa Barbara itself has been facing lately. However, one aspect of Ochoa’s piece that I couldn’t help but knit-pick was the costume: a high-necked black leotard and gloves paired with black knee socks, leaving only an awkward area of upper thigh exposed. The costumes hindered the beauty of Ochoa’s piece, as the confusing decision not to cover the entire leg truncated the dancers’ lines. The piece closed out the show on a breathtaking note, as principal dancers Dylan Gutierrez and Victoria Jaiani danced a stunning grand pas de deux through the lowering of the curtain. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86823\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1436669171\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86821\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86823\" data-attachment-id=\"86823\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/the-joffrey-presents-not-your-grandmas-ballet/calp_joffrey_joy_header_3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?fit=630%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,354\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?fit=630%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86823\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?resize=630%2C354\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CalP_Joffrey_Joy_header_3.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86823\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A moment of symmetry from Ochoa’s ‘Mammatus’.

In spite of the numerous scandals that have recently struck the dance world in conjunction with the</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-me-too.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#MeToo movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Wheater believes that “dance is having a moment right now.” It was evident that while ballet still very much tailored to an older, wealthier audience, the Joffrey is leading the charge toward a more progressive and accepting future for the art form: starting with bodies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Robert Joffrey said, ‘A great dancer comes in every shape and size,’ and I believe that is true if you look at our company today,” Wheater said. And he’s right: throughout the performance I was pleasantly surprised by the (relative) diversity; the presence of breasts and strong thighs more common than that of alarming skinniness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While acceptance of the human form as it comes seems like a small step, seeing</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/arts/eating-disorders-haunt-ballerinas.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attainable body standards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the stage of one of the world’s most renowned companies is no small feat.

Each one gives the performance a personal touch and individualizes the “Monologues” to where it is being performed at any given time.

People were sitting with friends, and as the music began to fade away the stage darkened, prompting the show to commence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guided by three MCs, the show proceeded with over 20 monologues and “Herstories.” Throughout the show, the stage was lit in different colors, switching after every monologue — and with a set-free stage, all attention went to the women speaking. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185562760\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86379\"><img data-attachment-id=\"86380\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/vagina-monologues-2019-confronting-the-taboos/unnamed-1-26/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=1583%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1583,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86380\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=738%2C954\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"954\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using little to no props and wearing unobtrusive costumes only added to the fact that there was a spotlight on the women and that it was meant to stay on them and the accounts they presented. Each of these stories was meant to bring forth empathy and help the audience relate to the story. Every word spoken in the production was a woman’s account of her life or a specific event that happened. Knowing that these narratives are based off of real women’s lives helps people to truly understand the production and the truth behind the words spoken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every woman has experienced different things in her life, and that is what the monologues represent. This is why there were amazingly hilarious stories of a woman appreciating her body such as “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vagina’s Happy” as well as deep, heart-wrenching narratives of rape and war as seen in “My Vagina Was My Village.” That’s the point of the “Vagina Monologues” — to remind people that there are both good and bad stories when it comes to the lives of women around the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to help women who need support when they previously had none, the V-Day Spotlight campaign draws focus to a particular issue that needs to be addressed either in the United States or worldwide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the campaign calls attention to the issue of decarceration of women in prison and for programs in detention centers with goals to help women process past experiences and heal. By spotlighting this issue, V-Day Humboldt hopes to seek higher ethical treatment to women in prison. They also hope to bring attention to the factors that cause higher incarceration rates for women, including racism, poverty and violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This particular production of the “Vagina Monologues” also chose to help benefit another group. All proceeds from the production were donated to the group Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA), an organization that seeks to help eliminate all forms of sexual assault through providing services and education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is what makes the “Vagina Monologues” special. Not only is this a show open for all to come and watch, but there is motivation behind the show. The people involved in the production want to tell the story of these women and want to do their best to help people who need it. They want to spread their stories to educate and to show people the lives of women around the world — and to donate to groups that raise awareness around issues that society often would rather ignore. The show is there to help, whether by teaching people about the violence in the world or helping others get over the social taboo of saying “vagina.”</span></p><div

Vagina! Vagina!” as the UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theater Troupe rang in its annual performance of “The Vagina Monologues” on Friday night. Its successful opening night was one of three possible showings for audiences to attend, with two more being offered on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s “Monologues” spoke especially to the increasing diversity and individual empowerment within the feminist movement and within the production itself, but the MC’s did not fail to note that equal representation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">women — regardless of whether those women possess a vagina — is still something that the show has yet to achieve. Yet its monologues and Herstories (pieces written originally by their performers) that spanned different ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, shapes, occupations and experiences seemed to mark a step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere in Campbell Hall was buzzing with excitement before the show. Some people were finding seats among their friends, while others were out in the lobby making purchases from an assortment of vagina-related merchandise that the production had to offer, which included anything from “Pussy Pops” to “Vagitarian” T-Shirts.

They immediately made the show an interactive experience by getting the audience involved in the repeated chanting of “vagina.” If there had already been an excited feel in the theater before this moment, it was no match for the exuberance that vibrated throughout the entire hall during this communal chant. It was an exercise in turning the word “vagina” into one of triumph and pride, and it started the performance off in an enthusiastic way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no invisible thread pulling the monologues and Herstories along in a linear fashion — each story was unique from the one before it in both its commentary and in the character(s) who delivered it. Every monologue provided a different depiction of feminism and often did so in order to refute feminist stereotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Herstory “On Feminism” took every cliché of the feminist persona and targeted them against the performer: a sorority girl who wears bras and likes to have sex with men. She argued that these qualities do not make her any less of a feminist, as feminism does not represent a certain type of woman but instead represents a set of ideals that any individual can live by. In another monologue titled “Because He Liked to Look at It,” the speaker acknowledged the controversy of learning to love her vagina by seeing it through the eyes of a man who loved it first. As the speaker pointed out, this does not follow the archetypical portrayal of a feminist discovering her vagina (without the help of a man). Yet, perhaps these perspectives that do not fit precisely into the mold of what society deems as “feminist” are doing their part to break that mold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many of the monologues and Herstories combined humor, wit and metaphor to create messages of empowerment, others used grim anecdotes in order to reflect on the work that still needs to be done to protect women against sexual assault, both in the United States and globally. The monologue “My Vagina Was My Village,” for example, graphically depicted the story of a Bosnian refugee woman who had endured sexual assault at the hands of multiple soldiers over the course of a week. Some of the last words spoken in the monologue were, “I do not touch now.” The performance was a chilling reminder that for so many women throughout the world, the vagina is not associated with strength and love but with pain and suffering, both physical and emotional.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One characteristic that was constant throughout each of the performances was the passion with which they were delivered. Lines were often spoken with fervor, accompanied by unabashed moans and roaming hands if the moment demanded it. During somber performances, the distress and sorrow could be heard palpably in the speakers’ voices. This visceral emotion was especially present during “My Angry Vagina,” as the speaker paced across the stage animatedly venting about the entire existence of tampons. As she spoke, one got the sense that she had the voices of a million women who felt the exact same way speaking though her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After leaving the audience in hysterics with the classic “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vaginas Happy,” the show was ended with “My Revolution Begins in the Body.” As would only make sense, the body had been commented on frequently throughout the night. It had been explored from the perspective of different heights in the especially creative and insightful Herstory, “The Animal Kingdom of Femininity,” and its universal beauty had been reflected upon in, “An Ode to the Shy Latina.” Throughout the show, the performers had found beauty in every part of the body, and they ended the night with one simple command: “Go ahead, love.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80995\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/vagina-monologues-bring-intersectional-discourse-to-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80995\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/vagina-monologues-bring-intersectional-discourse-to-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/vagina-monologues-bring-intersectional-discourse-to-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/vagina-monologues-bring-intersectional-discourse-to-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/vagina-monologues-bring-intersectional-discourse-to-campbell-hall/","id":6484,"author":{"id":831,"name":"Catherine Weatherly"},"related":[6483,6482,6481],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Biko House: Punks, Progressives and Politics","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2017-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Time and time again, the Biko House has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial events in the United States. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In September of 2005, the <i>Nexus</i> released an article titled “The Rise of the Biko Empire,” praising the recent influx of, as it described, a “wave of artsy combustion from soft white underbellies” in their garage venue. Most of the article describes the orchestrated chaos brought on by unique and flamboyant bands in 2005.</div>\n</div>\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ending of the article caught my attention, as it asked readers the question, “What’s in store for the future of the Biko House?” Even though I believe the question refers to Biko’s musical scene, I don’t think the writer or any student in 2005 for that matter could have predicted how our world would be today.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I do not want to dive into the details of the United States’ current socio-political climate, but if you don’t know already, it’s bad. It has probably always been bad and my younger self just didn’t take notice. It might have been because politicians were more into dog-whistle politics than directly saying absurd, problematic things out loud. But whatever the reason, Biko’s empire has risen to the occasion and become more than just a musical empire. Keep in mind that my use of the word “empire” isn’t insinuating a single authoritarian rule but, rather, an expansive, all-encompassing multi-faceted entity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79633\" style=\"width: 2071px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"686434280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79633\" data-attachment-id=\"79633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/unnamed-1-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=2061%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2061,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=2061&amp;ssl=1 2061w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko was established to be a safe space for POC in a predominantly white institution, but it has evolved to become an empire of social change, music and solidarity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Time and time again, Biko has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial happenings, like those from 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After the racially charged incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri, Biko’s Garage was open to UCSB faculty and staff, students and local residents to discuss and stand in solidarity with the Mizzou protests. After the recent unfoldings of the presidential election, BIKO has served as an oasis of peace. Activism can be tiring, not just physically but mentally; sometimes that’s not something one wishes to bring back home. Many of Biko’s residents participated and continue participating in progressive work outside of the house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko Garage, Isla Vista’s rectangular punk haven, is a cement room with capacity for maybe three and a half cars, or, on Friday night, 30 or so college kids with adrenaline to burn. Sound bled from the squat building as I approached it last weekend, my heart already in sync with the bass drum’s boom. “Wait!” called my friends, whom I’d started to outpace, but my legs wouldn’t listen. Biko zoomed up in front of us: two adjoined garages, one of which was closed but pulsing with noise; the other serving as a merch tent/lounge where some kids were hanging out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Drawing up to a table on which sat some flyers, a jar stuffed with dirty dollar bills and a pair of hairy forearms, I fished a $20 bill from my pocket and slapped it down, with maybe a bit too much gusto, as the owner of the forearms raised his eyebrows and gave me change. I stuffed the remaining $5 bills into the jar, and together we walked to the door, which was shaking. I gripped the greasy doorknob, turned it and leaned in. The four of us walked into the sun. We surfaced for air, joining the crush of people that had migrated outside, waiting for Genocide Jack. The crowd was, as a whole, black-shirted, lip-pierced and grinning—couple of camo swatches, a spark of Day-Glo hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During a particularly raucous song of the band’s set, lead singer Brian Bellrose crossed the invisible line between stage and stands, whirling around and bouncing off his fans. The zone surrounded me, a pink punk mist. Nothing else mattered. The only distinction between Bellrose and the people who’d paid $5 to see him was the mic, and even that he gave away, giving literal voice to anyone with something to scream. Most of it was indecipherable, but the message was clear, loud and nonverbal: energy so vicious that it’s often misconstrued as anger. This conclusion is evidenced by punk performers’ offstage impressions — I’ve never met one who was anything but gracious, progressive and kind. That night was no exception.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a rousing performance of the Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right,” accompanied by much floor-thrashing, crowd-singing and a heartfelt thank-you from the band, the show was over, and we tumbled back into the night, dazed and a little confused.</p>\n<p>Music, art and activism are what is brewed up in Biko. To continue to stand by its message, Biko additionally tries to prioritize women of color and POC musical performers, but it still opens its doors to everyone. We have seen the future of Biko that was conceptualized back in 2005, and it’s beautiful. Effervescent, colorful, strong and full of spirit; whether it’s the music pumping out of the garage or a presentation on vegetarian inclusiveness, Biko has become a platform for those without platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79632\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79632\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/","id":6486,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6485,6484,6483],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/artsweek/performing-art","highestPage":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
