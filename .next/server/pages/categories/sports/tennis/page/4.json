The Gauchos also routed the Trojan’s No. 46 duo of junior Rianna Valdes and sophomore Angela Kulikov in doubles play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos can secure more victories against ranked opponents early in the season, their case for appearances in the ITA rankings will only grow stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s matchup will also give the Gauchos a chance to showcase their talented freshmen, Elizaveta Volodko and Lise Sentenac, who started their UCSB careers in a relatively turbulent fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sentenac fell short in her first singles match against UCLA’s junior Gabby Andrews, and Volodko’s first singles match against UCLA’s No. 46 Abi Altick was ruled “unfinished” by the referee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair also fell short in both of their respective doubles matches during opening weekend, and only Volodko would exit the weekend with a victory in her singles match against USC’s junior Valdes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will look to give Volodko and Sentenac more exposure against the Hurricanes, and hopefully make them top competitors in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the outcome of their match against Miami, UCSB will go head-to-head with either No. 13 Auburn University or Tulane University the day after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auburn could give the Gauchos another shot at a ranked victory, if the Gauchos wind up facing them in the final round of the tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tigers boast a pair of ranked singles players with No. 53 freshman Jaeda Daniel and No. 77 sophomore Taylor Russo, and a No. 31 ranked duo of Russo and senior Alizee Michaud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tigers are 3-0 on the season, and have yet to lose a single game, winning each of their three matchups with scores of 4-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tulane does not dominate the ITA rankings in the same way that Auburn does, but the Green Wave has proven to be a formidable opponent so far this season with a record of 2-0.

He also played alongside junior Anders Holm in doubles play as the duo finished the season with a 15-6 mark.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Due to his wonderful play, Moreno de Alboran received All-Big West honors in both singles and doubles play last season. Following a very successful fall season, including becoming the first Gaucho to receive an invitational to the ITA Fall National Championships, Moreno de Alboran is ranked No. 42 in the ITA top 150 singles players in the country.</p>\n<p>Freund returns for his senior season following a 19-8 record in singles play as well as winning every single conference match. Freund was awarded All-Big West second team honors for singles, and All-Big West first team honors for doubles.</p>\n<p>Alongside Moreno de Alboran, the two claimed the 2016 Jack Kramer Invitational Doubles Championship becoming the first Gaucho duo to claim the trophy.</p>\n<p>UCSB also returns Holm and senior Chase Masciorini this season. Holm recorded the best winning percentage of any Gaucho last season, going 20-5 and earning All-Big West second team honors.</p>\n<p>Masciorini finished last season with a 17-12 record, and is yet another reliable starter for the Gauchos despite some spotty play during the fall season.</p>\n<p>SMU enters the match looking to end their two-game losing skid as it currently sits at 1-2 to begin the season. They beat Abilene Christian 4-0 in their first match before losing to Harvard in heartbreaking fashion, 4-3. In their latest match, SMU got handled by No. 8 Texas, 4-0.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs finished last season ranked No. 38 in the nation but are a relatively young team this year, featuring seven newcomers. In addition, SMU lost their top three players from last season — Ronald Slobodchikov, Hunter Johnson and Yates Johnson — to graduation.</p>\n<p>They will need their returning standouts such as senior Charles Nettlefold and redshirt freshman Gardiner Perotti to step up in order to compete with the Gauchos. The last time the two teams played, back in 2015, SMU defeated UCSB 6-1.</p>\n<p>With a win, Santa Barbara will then take on the winner of the match between USC or Indiana, also being played on Saturday. If the Gauchos can take down SMU, they will likely face USC, who currently resides as the No. 5 team in the nation and is a favorite to beat unranked Indiana.</p>\n<p>The Trojans have three players currently ranked in the top 100, including Brandon Holt (11), Logan Smith (54), and Thibault Forget (96). Holt actually defeated Freund earlier this season at the Southern California Intercollegiate in two sets, and USC would present a stark early-season challenge for UCSB should they face them. The Trojans finished last season 27-6, including a 16-0 home record.</p>\n<p>Indiana routed Ball State and Eastern Illinois in their first two matches, before losing to Memphis 5-2. The Hoosiers went 13-13 last year, but also acquired most of their losses in the highly competitive Big Ten.</p>\n<p>Indiana is led by Senior Raheel Manji, who was ranked 125th in the country in the latest ITA singles rankings. Either way, Santa Barbara will look to acquire a signature early season win in their second match of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite having their first three matches of the season pushed back due to the natural disasters, the Gauchos still boast a strong returning core, and should prove to be competitive in their first two matches of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin its season at 2 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 26, against SMU at Marks Tennis Stadium at USC. The Gauchos will play either USC or Indiana the following day with the time to be determined.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Davis has been a coach for the UCSB tennis team since 2000, and he has done a terrific job. He has been the Big West Conference Coach of the Year a total of nine times and has led the tennis program to 10 Big West titles and NCAA appearances, including the ones during the outstanding year they had this year.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s tennis team went a solid 19-6 this year with Davis at the helm. This included a resounding 5-0 record in conference play and a respectable 6-3 record in home games. They ended their season with a 4-1 loss to the University of Mississippi in the NCAA Championship, but this was not all for nothing. The team showed out all season, and this included a 4-1 win against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Davis rallied the troops once again this season, and the team responded with an outstanding performance all year. He showed once again why he is one of the best — if not the best — coaches around and why he was invited to and honored at the ATP finals last year. He has taken the UCSB men’s tennis team from a good team to a great team, and his style of play has the Gauchos performing to the best of their ability, and they seemed to be firing on all cylinders before their loss to Ole Miss. This just shows how Davis has transformed the program and justifies his selection for Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/","id":1208,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1207,1206,1205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morgan, Freund Set to Face No. 3 Florida in First Round of the NCAA Doubles Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite the team being knocked out a couple weeks ago, Morgan Mays and Simon Freund will team up one last time in hopes of making some noise in the NCAA doubles championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB men’s tennis returns once more as the final postseason bout is soon to be underway.

With their last defeat coming all the way back on April 10 versus UC Davis, this pair has proven time and time again that they’re able to compete at an elite level.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On a specifically top-10 basis, Freund and Mays have gone 2-0.

Paired with Assistant Coach Blake Muller and his illustrious career at Stanford, the team was led by some of the greatest former talents.</p>\n<p>“I was really excited when I got here … I saw everyone really intent on changing the culture here.” Mays mentioned because previous to the 2013 season, Santa Barbara was not yet the Big West powerhouse we see today. The team was also nonfactors at a national scale, with all of their recent NCAA Tournament appearances being cut short in the Round of 64 mark. Their last most successful showing came back in 1997 when UCSB was ranked No. 17 in the nation and reached the Sweet 16 stage of the competition. Since then, and from the turn of the century, the Gauchos haven’t really played at that same sense of quality.</p>\n<p>During his junior year, Mays first began to see himself consistently lead the pack at the roster’s court one spot. He also became captain for the first time as an upperclassman.</p>\n<p>“It was another opportunity I looked very much forward to; [captaining] is a position of high responsibility and it meant that much more considering we were coming off a great year since we had won the Big West title,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mays followed this up by making the point that, early on, every season the team wanted to see exactly where they’d stack up in the conference; however, their expectations began to involve a pursuit of placement onto the ITA rankings. That same year, Mays posted a 17-11 singles record and a 13-9 in dual play, which earned him an All-Conference First Team Singles selection and an Honorable Mention in Doubles. The team went on to qualify as their conference’s first seed and claimed back to back Big West championships. “</p>\n<p>Starting last year, with the bringing in of newer and younger faces, was when I saw the tennis program’s culture first begin to change,” Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays was referring to standout names like sophomores Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno, as well as his doubles co-star junior Simon Freund. The identity of UCSB’s tennis program truly started to emerge as they began to set their goals high with a conference three-peat and potential upsets versus opposing top-tier programs.</p>\n<p>As this season’s campaign began to wind down, the accolades and record breaking began to pour in. UCSB’s late calendar win streak of 12 in a row handed them another Big West first seed which ultimately resulted in both a league and playoff clean sweep, granting the program their championship trifecta. Their overall season record of 19-6 had them at a .760 win percentage, which is the highest in franchise history and earned them the No. 37 ITA ranking. This national ranking finish also ended up being the program’s third-ever highest spot, with only the 1997 and 1998 teams both finishing top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time in a while that people started to notice us on a national stage … we faced four different top-10 teams in the early part of the season and managed a great performance against all of them,” he said.</p>\n<p>All in all, Morgan Mays was once again elected to the All-Conference First Team and even announced as the Big West Player of the Year. Davis also earned 2017’s Coach of the Year recognition. Regionally speaking, ITA also honored Mays with the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award and Muller as Assistant Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Altogether it’s been an incredible year, I’m proud and I really believe the culture has shifted upwards from here. I truly think this program will excel and continue to win titles for years to come … all thanks to Marty and Blake, we all hope this mentality will keep growing.”</p>\n<p>Much praise can be passed on to the UCSB men’s tennis team, but there’s still more work left to be done. As for now, fans and Gauchos alike can surely be excited for more years of tennis court dominance thanks to a stellar youth core and a phenomenal coaching staff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/","id":1206,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1205,1204,1203],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season Review: UCSB Women’s Tennis Repeats as Big West Champs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite early season struggles, the UCSB women's tennis team made a few changes midway through the year which helped it get its groove back en route to its second straight Big West championship.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The remarkable run of the UCSB’s women’s tennis team officially has come to an end, leaving behind another successful season for the Gauchos.

Santa Barbara then went on a tear through the Big West Conference, stringing together wins against opponents like Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal Poly. Of the seven regular-season conference games they played in April, the Gauchos swept their opponents 4-0 a total of four times.</p>\n<p>The impressive run of seven-straight victories carried Santa Barbara to the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, while three more wins to extend its streak to 10 matches led to an eventual return to the Big West Championships, during which the team played Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Hawaii was responsible for the Gauchos’ sole blemish in their conference record, and the matchup between the two teams was extremely competitive. However, it was UCSB who was able to answer back against the Rainbow Wahine by winning the conference final match 4-1. The finish at the top of the Big West Conference punched the team’s ticket to the first round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Results of the NCAA selection chose UCSB to face the No. 47 UCLA Bruins. The Bruins were a familiar opponent for the Gauchos, who had played them during their non-conference schedule. The Bruins were able to win that match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>The first-round meet between the two teams began with doubles play against the talented Bruin duo of freshman Ena Shibahara and junior Kristin Wiley. UCLA captured the doubles point after a loss by UCSB tandem junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Melissa Baker.</p>\n<p>In singles play, junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic tried to give the Gauchos an early leg up on the Bruins, but the play of No. 5 Shibahara and sophomore Alaina Miller was too much for the Gauchos’ standouts. Junior Terri Fleming clinched the meet for the Bruins after defeating Natalie Da Silveira. Yet again, it was the Bruins winning the match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>Despite the early exit for the Gauchos, the team is still poised to be a contender in both the Big West and the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The key players the Gauchos will be losing after this season are seniors Melissa Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson and Stefani Stojic. All three of these players were crucial to both UCSB Big West Championship titles and were key players in getting the team out of its regular-season slump this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end this season with a variety of accolades. The team has captured the first back-to-back conference titles since 1995 and 1996, which signaled the end years of UCSB’s six-straight Big West titles from 1991-96. The consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances were also the program’s first since then.</p>\n<p>It certainly was an exciting season to follow, as the women’s tennis program is taking steps toward returning to its glory of being one of the top-tier Big West teams.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

doubles play in which UCLA freshman Ena Shibahara and junior Kristin Wiley defeated Gaucho sophomore Stephanie Yamada and junior Natalie Da Silveira 6-1, giving the Bruins the early 1-0 lead. The impact of Shibahara was a certainty to be felt, and the Gauchos’ inability to limit Shibahara’s effect on the match was not a good sign early in the meet.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next completed match, the No. 58 Bruin tandem of sophomores Gabby Andrews and Alaina Miller went on to defeat junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Melissa Baker, 6-2.

With the Bruins capturing the early lead 1-0, the meet continued on to singles play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning singles play were two extremely talented players who have been crucial to their respective teams all season, UCLA’s No. 5 Shibahara and UCSB’s Dubavets. The two standouts battled heavily throughout the match, keeping a close score with every set. </span></p>\n<p>However, it was Shibahara who was able to keep Dubavets away and earned the victory in two sets 6-3, 6-4. Up next was Stojic’s turn to try to turn it around for the Gauchos in her match against Miller. Stojic was able to win the first set 6-3, but Miller was able to complete the comeback as she went on to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Da Silveira continued the Gauchos’ fighting spirit and played an extremely tough first set against her opponent, junior Terri Fleming. Fleming was able to win the first set 7-6 and Da Silveira was unable to come back as she lost the second set 6-2. Like the previous battle between UCLA and UCSB, the meet finished in a 4-0 Bruin victory with three singles matches left unfinished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ loss does not come from a lack of effort or will to win. The team was simply unable to come out on top after pushing the matches to the brink. The loss of several close matches came one after another, and UCLA was successfully able to prevent the Gauchos from establishing a rhythm and attempting a comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Gauchos on the team such as Dubavets, Stojic and Atanasson were unable to step up and, despite the valiant effort, do have to feel disappointed with exiting the tournament so early. </span></p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s season ends with an overall record of 17-10; a perfect April and 10-game winning streak helped the team finish with the second seed in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win the Big West Championship, their second consecutive title and reached the first round of the NCAA tournament. The end of the Gauchos’ season brings the graduation of seniors Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson oxford, and Stojic. However, the Gauchos will be able to retain Dubavets, Atanasson, and Da Silveira for one more year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/","id":1204,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1203,1202,1201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Returning the Favor: The Reintroduction of UCSB Women’s Tennis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first NCAA Tournament match in program history last season, the UCSB women's tennis team entered its 2016-17 campaign even more determined to continue the ascension of the Gauchos re...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At the end of March, the UCSB women’s tennis team had an overall record of 7-9.

It’s exciting to get back to NCAA play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos needed to get back to the Big West Championship, and that is exactly what the team did.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77704\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77704\" data-attachment-id=\"77704\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77704\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jaimee Gilbertson returns a serve with a powerful backhand.<em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The squad beat rival Cal Poly 4-0 in the quarterfinals and then went on to beat perennial opponent Long Beach State 4-1, all to find themselves at the stage at which the team believed they were going to end up all season long.</p>\n<p>The only team in the way of the Gauchos moving on to the NCAA tournament was, you guessed it, the University of Hawaii. The Gauchos played an exciting match, with the clinching point coming from a singles victory by freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p>The final victory in the month of April allowed the Gauchos to yet again raise the cup, a satisfaction surely made sweeter by beating the team that had been above them so often during the season. The Championship win also meant a perfect April for the UCSB women’s tennis team, as the team won all 10 games played, and they will surely carry that momentum into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis program has not always experienced this kind of success. Last year’s Big West Championship became the program’s first in 20 years. The team had fallen into mediocrity after winning the Big West Championship six consecutive years from 1991-1996.</p>\n<p>The work toward obtaining the accolades UCSB has earned over the past couple of seasons can be traced back to five years ago, when longtime Fresno State Head Coach Simon Thibodeau was brought to Santa Barbara to lead the program.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was difficult to leave Fresno State, where we had a lot of success, and I was really trying to bring UCSB to the same level. I felt the school had even more potential due to the location and academic rank of this school,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>For the first three seasons of Thibodeau’s career, the team went 39-34, during which it was bounced out of the tournament every single season; the conference final was its highest mark yet.</p>\n<p>However, it was in this period of time when Thibodeau began to recruit players who would grow to be important pieces of the current winning formula at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson were added in 2013 and Natalie Da Silveira became a Gaucho in 2014. The 2015 additions to the squad included Amanda Atanasson, Palina Dubavets, Stefani Stojic and Yamada.</p>\n<p>“We also had a donor who boosted our scholarship amount, so we were able to go get a few more players like Palina, Amanda and Stefani Stojic, who are all transfers, and we gained some budget in their scholarship, so I was able to get more top players and I was able to compete at the highest level.”</p>\n<p>All of these players have been critical to UCSB’s rise to the top of the Big West Conference, and Thibodeau credits an increase in funding from UCSB donors as the primary reason the women’s tennis program is able to acquire highly talented transfers such as Dubavets and Stojic.</p>\n<p>“We really try to make this program the full package for any prospect in the world that wants to go study in the U.S. and play tennis. We’re getting closer; we would like to build more facilities in the future, but that’s the next step in terms of fundraising.”</p>\n<p>The current tennis roster boasts seven international players out of the current 12 roster spots, a sign of the increased ability of the program to attract better prospects.</p>\n<p>“Most of the best teams in the tournament are all fully funded in their scholarships. They have the NCAA limitation of eight full in/out of state scholarships for their players. That was not the case here when I took the program, and we really needed to fundraise to get to the amount that most of the big programs have.”</p>\n<p>Headed into the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos are looking to see how they will measure up to this top-25 talent showcased throughout the NCAA tournament and are hoping that the increased experience coming off of last year’s tournament exit will propel them farther than the second round.</p>\n<p>“We feel that we are just one player away from being able to compete with the top 16 teams in the country, and we hope to be at that level in the years to come.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77781\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77781\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/","id":1201,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1200,1199,1198],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos-Rebels Showdown Set for First Round of NCAA Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to three-peat as Big West champions, the Gauchos are looking to make the next step to go deeper in the postseason beginning this Friday against Ole Miss.

Out of the 63 other teams in attendance, Santa Barbara drew Ole Miss.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row the Gauchos were able to earn an NCAA slot and make it this far into the postseason. However, each year they haven’t been able to make it out of the first round.</p>\n<p>Last year had a then No. 44 UCSB face off against a No. 32 Georgia Tech, which ultimately had the Yellow Jackets claiming the meet at a score of 4-1. The year before that was also a 4-2 loss to Texas Tech University.</p>\n<p>However, there’s plenty to update before the national competition commences. The Gauchos are coming off an exciting Big West Championship run which was sweetly capped off with a 4-1 victory over their Blue-Green rival, the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p>This competition had impressive performances across all team members, which ultimately elevated UCSB’s standings in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings. Previously at the No. 40 spot, the Gauchos now boast No. 37 overall.</p>\n<p>As for Santa Barbara’s star Court 1 doubles pair of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays, they also remain in the top 40 in the nation at No. 35 overall.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ole Miss’s regular-season finish led to it earning sixth place in the SEC tennis standings.</p>\n<p>The Rebels are coming off their most recent match against the University of Florida, in which they were swept 4-0 in the quarterfinal round and subsequently knocked out of the SEC championship tournament.</p>\n<p>This result hardly deteriorated their ITA score, as their ranking actually moved up a spot, from No. 28 to No. 27. The Rebels also hold both singles and doubles honors, as junior All-American Gustav Hansson is ranked 23rd in the nation while sophomore Fabian Fallert and junior Grey Hamilton hold the 19th overall spot.</p>\n<p>Before being swept 4-0, Ole Miss was on an eight-match win streak with its last loss occurring back in early April.</p>\n<p>Adding incentive to the match will be the No. 4 singles match, as both Ole Miss’s sophomore Fabian Fallert and UCSB’s sophomore Anders Holm will look to end each other’s 11-match win streaks.</p>\n<p>Friday will be the first time UCSB has ever faced Ole Miss. The recurring strategy and point of emphasis has been the Gauchos’ doubles play. It has been key in their double-digit win streak and has aided the team’s ability to stand its ground against top-20 programs.</p>\n<p>“The doubles point is always so huge,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “It’s only one point but it’s the first point of the match, and emotionally it gave us a real lift … singles as a result has shown this.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went undefeated in the entire month of April and will look to start May off on the right foot as well. The winner of this first-round matchup will then go on and face either No. 5 UCLA or Army West Point.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play Ole Miss on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. at UCLA’s Sunset Canyon Tennis Courts.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/","id":1203,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1202,1201,1200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rallying Gauchos Prepare for Bruins to Open Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to end its 20-year drought of not winning a Big West title, the UCSB women's tennis program awaits to face UCLA in its second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance.

I’ve felt that this is a match we would want to see again, so it’s exciting to get a replay with them at a neutral site,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>This second look for the Gauchos at the talented UCLA squad seems to be as challenging as the time before, as UCSB will have to deal with the overall talent of the Bruin roster, which is comprised of standouts like Shibahara and Hart.</p>\n<p>Shibahara is currently ranked the No. 5 singles player in the nation, and the pair of Shibara and Hart is currently ranked No. 12 in the nation. Hart is also ranked in another Bruin doubles pair alongside junior Terri Fleming at No. 32.</p>\n<p>The Bruins third and final ranked pair headed into the matchup this weekend is No. 58 sophomores Gabby Andrews and Alaina Miller. The three ranked doubles teams and talented singles players on the Bruins roster are all challenges looking to prevent the Gauchos from progressing onto the second round of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>If there was a time for Santa Barbara to come out with a hard-fought win against a tough team, it would be now.</p>\n<p>The team has not lost a match since its regular-season battle with Hawaii on March 30 and is now carrying the momentum of a perfect month of April, which saw the team win 10 consecutive matches and earn a second consecutive Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>The keys Gauchos behind this season’s impressive playoff push, such as juniors Palina Dubavets and Natalie Da Silveira and seniors Stefani Stojic, Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson, have all earned a variety of accolades for their efforts respectively.</p>\n<p>The Big West named Dubavets to the singles first team, and she also earned a spot on both the doubles first and second team rosters.</p>\n<p>Da Silveira and Gilbertson earned second team singles honors. Stojic was named to the doubles first team for her work as one half of the Dubavets/Stojic pair, and Baker was named to the doubles second team for her partnership with Dubavets as well. It is these players who the Gauchos are hoping will push the team to new heights in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have seven of the eight players returning from last year’s team, and everyone has seemed to gain experience and play better,” Thibodeau said. “We have a similar team, but with more experience, and now we’re playing a team that we know at a site closer to home, which has us feeling good about the match.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will play the No. 23 UCLA Bruins on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. If UCSB advances, it will face either Pepperdine or LIU Brooklyn on Saturday, May 13 at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/","id":1202,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1201,1200,1199],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Completes Three-Peat, Fourth Big West Title in Five Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB took home the Big West conference title following a win in the championship game against rival Cal Poly by a 4-1 result.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team continues their win streak into the postseason.

Santa Barbara arrived at Indian Wells Tennis Garden last Thursday for their semifinal match against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The doubles portion was more closely fought than the Gauchos would have like. Nevertheless, UCSB won on every doubles court; thanks to Morgan Mays / Simon Freund on court 1 (7-5), Nicolas Moreno / Anders Holm on court 2 (6-4), and Cody Rakela / Kristian Prior on court 3 (6-6).</p>\n<p>The singles portion of Thursday’s meet was where the Gauchos finally found their form, as they lead 1-0 with the doubles advantage point. First to finish was Holm on court 4, whom bested UCI’s Mason Hansen after a pair of 6-2 victories.</p>\n<p>Next was Rakela vs. Bruce Man-Son-Hing on court 5, which ended in Santa Barbara’s favor at 6-1 / 6-2. Then, the deciding match took place on court 3 where Freund almost swept Luis Lopez by a score of 6-0 / 6-1. Ultimately, this gave UCSB the three remaining points necessary to take home the early 4-0 win on the day; thus granting them a Big West Championship spot on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defeated second seed UC Davis that same Thursday after a hard fought 4-2 win, therefore earning themselves a visit with UCSB for the second year in a row.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s finals meet almost mirrored the same intensity as these teams’ regular season bout. The day began with the doubles portion, per usual, as court 3 first went in favor of Mustangs Auproux and Damiens by a score of 6-4. UCSB then responded on court 2 with a 6-2 victory by Moreno and Holm.</p>\n<p>Finally, the deciding doubles match was an exciting nail biter on court 1 where Freund / Mays met against Pang / Donovan for perhaps their most important sets of the season. It was a tough competition to watch, but UCSB eventually prevailed by a close victory of 7-6 (3).</p>\n<p>Currently with the doubles advantage point and early 1-0 lead, the Gauchos were just 3 wins away from earning the title through singles play. Cal Poly’s Corey Pang made a quick statement on court 1 with a pair of 6-4 victories, bringing his team back into the meet at a 1-all score.</p>\n<p>Then Holm matched this result with a pair of 6-4’s for himself on court 4. Once again, Freund extended the Gauchos’ lead after a tough 7-6 (6) score, then a 6-0 sweep, on court 3.</p>\n<p>Now, with the meet at 3-1 and in favor of Santa Barbara, the next court to finish would be able to decide the tournament. On court 2, Nicolas Moreno faced off against Ben Donovan as the two battled it out for a three setter.</p>\n<p>Moreno took the first with a smooth 6-0 sweep, but then Donovan clawed back into it with a 6-4 of his own. Then, Moreno earned not only another victory for his team, but the last point necessary to crown UCSB as champions in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Upon the meet’s conclusion, the ceremony commenced as the Gauchos celebrated a three-peat championship performance. Including the second year in a row in which Santa Barbara topples their rival Cal Poly, in the finals, by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Following last weekend’s results, UCSB’s ITA rankings continue to grow as they are currently hoping for a participant spot in this year’s NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take a short break as they await a tournament at-large bid from the selection committee. Tune in this Tuesday at 2 PM as the Selection Show will inform UCSB of their NCAA Regional game opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

It also earned its fourth regular season title with Head Coach Marty Davis at the helm.</p>\n<p>Dating back to April 11, 2015, UCSB has extended its win streak against Big West opponents to 11 straight victories in the regular season.  Including the past two conference tournaments, Santa Barbara holds a 16-match win streak against its Big West counterparts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been in outstanding form as of late; its last meet loss was way back on March 13 against No. 4 Texas Christian University.</p>\n<p>After their victory over the current No. 50 Cal Poly, the Gauchos are currently No. 40 in the nation according to Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings.</p>\n<p>The duo sensation of Gaucho junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays maintains a No. 30 doubles ranking as well, moving down one spot from No. 29.</p>\n<p>“This match [against Cal Poly] was actually bigger than the western conference regular season title,” Davis said. “We think it’s going to leave us far enough in the rankings where our RPI should get us into that large [NCAA selection] bid, regardless of the result at Indian Wells.”</p>\n<p>Coach Davis is referring to a spot for the Gauchos in the NCAA 2017 Division I men’s tennis tournament. That, of course, won’t occur until after the Big West Tournament and is set for some time around the middle of May.</p>\n<p>There’s much to know as UCSB enters the Big West Tournament in fine form, as well as with many historical accolades.</p>\n<p>The men’s tennis team will be competing for its third consecutive conference title. The Gauchos have previously won the Big West Tournament championships a total of 10 times program history.</p>\n<p>They have won 7 of the last 11 tournaments at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, which will once again be this year’s competition venue.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West championship concluded with a No. 1 and No. 2 seed finals matchup that had Santa Barbara face off against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The meet resulted in a 4-1 score and featured the familiar competitors of sophomore doubles pair Nicolas Moreno de Alboran/Anders Holm, junior Cody Rakela, senior Morgan Mays and senior Teague Hamilton, as well as Cal Poly’s No. 61 duo of seniors Corey Pang and Ben Donovan.</p>\n<p>Previewing Friday’s potential competitors, UCSB will meet against the winner of Wednesday’s No. 4- versus No. 5-seeded match of UC Irvine and the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance of both programs has been well established over the years.</p>\n<p>It last lost to UC Irvine during the 2014-15 season and fell to Hawaii during its 2012-13 campaign. Due to rain, the matchup between UCSB and Hawaii was canceled during the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>Irvine ended its season with a 5-2 loss to No. 2-seed UC Davis and concluded its 2017 regular season at 8-14. The Anteaters also managed a fourth-place conference ranking following a 2-4 finish.</p>\n<p>UCSB previously defeated UC Irvine 5-2 on April 15 while on the road.</p>\n<p>As for Hawaii, the Gauchos opened up their season with an away doubleheader against the Rainbow Warriors, which resulted in a 7-0 sweep. They ended the season last in the Big West Conference standings at 1-4 and also finished their regular season with a meager 2-14 overall record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against the winner of the No. 4/5 seed match, either UC Irvine or the University of Hawaii, this Friday, April 28 at 3 p.m. at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/","id":1200,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1199,1198,1197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Thriving Off Current 7-Match Win Streak, Hold No. 2 Seed in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The road to repeat as Big West conference champs begin this week for UCSB who holds the No. 2 seed headed into the tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team is preparing to go on the road to compete in the Big West Tournament at Indian Wells, where it will look to defend last season’s conference title.

In addition to benefitting from having five returners from the 2015-16 team, Santa Barbara is a more enticing team to keep an eye on entering the tournament, as it carries a seven-match winning streak into the postseason.</p>\n<p>However, for Cal Poly, the outlook coming into the tournament has been a bit less optimistic. The team barely missed out on having to play this Thursday in the first round in which the No. 8 and 9 seeds face off. Yet, even if the Mustangs had won, they would have been forced to face the unbeaten No. 1 Hawaii Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Mustangs get a second look at the Gauchos in the quarterfinals and hope to perform better the second time around.</p>\n<p>In order to perform better against UCSB, Cal Poly has to make an effort to get ahead early, be it in doubles play or in the first matches of singles play. The Gauchos were simply able to dominate the Mustangs, carrying the momentum from winning the doubles point in singles play during which only one Mustang, junior Molly Reed, picked up a victory in singles play.</p>\n<p>Stopping the Gauchos before they are able to get on a run looks to be the only way Cal Poly will be able to come out on top or at least thoroughly challenge UCSB.</p>\n<p>Should Santa Barbara get past the Mustangs, waiting in the second round could potentially be either No. 3 Long Beach State or No. 6 UC Davis. A good sign for the Gauchos in these potential matchups is that the team defeated both teams during the regular season. The Aggies also suffered a loss in the quarterfinals of last year’s tournament to UCSB, 4-0.</p>\n<p>A potential matchup against the Beach in this year’s tournament could be one of the most exciting.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State possesses a long and storied history in the Big West Championships, having been crowned champions an impressive 12 times since 2002.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s first match in the Big West Conference Championships is against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Friday, April 28, at 9 a.m. The championships run until Sunday, April 30, on which the championship match will be played at 9 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 20, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This is also the second straight year in which UCSB went undefeated at 5-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to report in regards to Saturday’s meet, as an action-packed doubles portion went underway. Court 2’s sophomores Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm tipped the balance early in favor of the hosts after a solid 6-1 victory. Court 3 saw a hard-fought 6-4 win for Cal Poly as the doubles sets were split evenly at 1-all.</p>\n<p>Court 1 proved to be a nail-biting decider, as the No. 55 doubles duo of Cal Poly, seniors Corey Pang and Ben Donovan, went head-to-head versus the No. 29 UCSB duo senior Morgan Mays and junior Simon Freund. The greater ranking ultimately prevailed, as the Gaucho pair earned the 7-6 victory and clenched the doubles advantage point for their team.</p>\n<p>“I thought I played well,” said Mays after the match, “I had a lot of fun and left it all out there on senior day, my last day here.”</p>\n<p>At the halfway break, Mays, along with fellow senior Teague Hamilton, were the recipients of team honors, as Saturday was men’s tennis senior day.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Senior Awards at the break.

Freund followed up with a 6-1 / 6-3 victory of his own on Court 3, granting Santa Barbara the 4-0 and early meet win on the day.</p>\n<p>Donovan managed to finally earn Cal Poly a point on Court 2 as he took Moreno to a closely contested third set at 0-6 / 6-2 / 6-4. Court 6’s junior Chase Masciorini reclaimed the momentum as he won a three-setter of his own at a 3-6 / 7-5 / 10-3 result. Thus, the tally was brought to the 5-1 total, the advantage still UCSB.</p>\n<p>The final singles match was perhaps the most heated; Court 1’s Mays and Pang battled it out into the meet’s third hour. The match went into three sets and remained heavily competitive throughout. Unfortunately, the result favored the visiting side as Pang defeated Mays at 3-6 / 6-1 / 6-4.</p>\n<p>It was to no avail, as the Gauchos took the 5-2 victory in the meet as well as a potential bid for NCAA tournament consideration.</p>\n<p>This concludes the men’s tennis regular season, as the Big West Tournament is set to commence this Wednesday, April 26, at Indian Wells, Calif.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77305\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/no-42-ucsb-topples-rival-cal-poly-5-2-clinch-no-1-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77305\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/no-42-ucsb-topples-rival-cal-poly-5-2-clinch-no-1-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/no-42-ucsb-topples-rival-cal-poly-5-2-clinch-no-1-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/no-42-ucsb-topples-rival-cal-poly-5-2-clinch-no-1-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/no-42-ucsb-topples-rival-cal-poly-5-2-clinch-no-1-seed-for-big-west-tournament/","id":1193,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1192,1191,1190],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Wins Final Seven Games of Regular Season After Defeating Cal Poly 4-1 in Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the final match of the regular season, the No. 48 UCSB women’s tennis team was able to beat the rival Cal Poly Mustangs at home by a final score of 4-1.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the final match of the regular season, the No. 48 UCSB women’s tennis team was able to beat the rival Cal Poly Mustangs at home by a final score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>The meet began with doubles play, during which UCSB was able to quickly take the doubles point in two straight sets, despite not fielding any of the three ranked pairs the Gauchos currently have according to the latest ITA rankings.

With Cal Poly getting its first points on the board, the meet was at 2-1 in favor of the Gauchos, but the UCSB women’s tennis team was able to regroup and run away with the rest of the meet.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly getting its first points on the board, the meet was at 2-1 in favor of the Gauchos, but the UCSB women’s tennis team was able to regroup and run away with the rest of the meet.</p>\n<p>The team went on to win the final two matches needed to clinch the victory in consecutive fashion as freshman Jaimee Gilbertson defeated Saltzen 6-4, 6-2. Gilbertson’s win over Saltzen increased her already team-leading record of 17 singles match victories to 18.</p>\n<p>Baker delivered the final blow to Cal Poly after defeating senior Sayaka Tsugai 6-3, 6-1, and the Gauchos officially became the winners of the women’s tennis Blue-Green rivalry three years in a row.</p>\n<p>Both Da Silveira and Baker were participants in last year’s Blue-Green rivalry, and it was good to see both players make significant contributions to this year’s rivalry in the form of picking up a victory in doubles and singles play.</p>\n<p>The win over Cal Poly marked the seventh-straight victory for the Gauchos, a streak that began on April 2 with a 4-1 win over Cal State Northridge. The seven-straight victories are the primary reason the Gauchos are where they are in the conference currently.</p>\n<p>During the seven-game streak, the team was able to beat six conference opponents, which allowed for the Gauchos to improve on the 1-1 record they had before the month of April.</p>\n<p>Their play on this hot streak has resembled the play of last season when the team won the Big West Championships, and they are hoping to carry their current momentum into the tournament to win the title two seasons in a row.</p>\n<p>In order to have the right to share the Big West Conference title, the Gauchos needed to get a win over the Cal Poly Mustangs and a loss by Hawaii to Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB won its match this weekend, the Rainbow Warriors were able to get by a tough Titan team, winning their match 4-0. The Gauchos will enter the tournament at the No. 2 seed without the Big West title they won just a year ago.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will travel to Indian Wells to kick off the Big West Championships, playing their first game on Friday, April 28, with a time and opponent yet to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/","id":45,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[44,43,42],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"route":"/categories/sports/tennis","highestPage":21}},"__N_SSG":true}
