The Gauchos are a team to keep an eye out for during the Big West championships and are aiming to make a memorable run for the NCAA regionals.</p>\n<p>“It never really surprises us when we win. We are a dangerous team,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “We are a sleeping team that is not ranked as high, but we are right there and we are playing better. We are ready to roll in the Big West, we can beat everyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara continued its efficient play against the Mustangs. Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson earned victories as they made quick work of senior Bryn Bacharach and freshman Celine Gruaz on court three.</p>\n<p>Freshman Stephanie Yamada and junior Melissa Baker almost earned a shutout of their own beating sophomores Abigail Bacharach and Molly Reed 6-1.</p>\n<p>No. 21 ranked doubles duo junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets were ahead 5-0 before the match went on unfinished as Yamada and Baker were able to clinch the doubles point beforehand.</p>\n<p>With the score at 1-0, the Gauchos continued to outperform the Mustangs winning the next five points in singles never trailing at any point during the match.</p>\n<p>Adler, Dubavets, Stojic, junior Jamiee Gilbertson, and Atanassan all won their singles matches in convincing fashion extending the lead and ensuring the win against Cal Poly. With the score at 6-0, all eyes were on court six as sophomores Molly Reed and Natalie Da Silveira were in their third set.</p>\n<p>The first went in Da Silveira’s favor as she edged out Reed 6-4. Reed came back in the second set winning 6-2, to force a third set between the two.</p>\n<p>Neither player would give in easily, putting up 18 points between each other in the third set.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs received their first team point as Reed put 10 past Da Silveira in the third set. Reed extended her singles win streak to three straight and ended her season going 6-4 in singles.</p>\n<p>With their momentous win to close out the Big West, the Gauchos turned around to wrap up their regular season against a tough Santa Clara team.</p>\n<p>Originally scheduled for a meeting in March, the match had to be postponed because of rain.With no rain clouds in sight, Santa Barbara and Santa Clara entered into a tough contest between two talented teams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to ensure a one point lead after winning the Doubles Point. Both pairs consisting of Dubavets &amp; Stojic as well as Yamada &amp; Baker won their respective sets 6-4 to start the match strong for UCSB.</p>\n<p>During the singles matches, the Broncos won two of the following five matches to get on the scoreboard. However, with strong play from Lou Adler, Stefani Stojic, and Natalie Da Silveira Santa Barbara won the match 4-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s two wins to conclude the season helped it to wrap up its campaign with a 15-7 overall and 7-1 Big West record. UCSB look to enter the big west tournament and dominate and avenge its only conference loss, 4-3, to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“We can dominate at each position. We lost 4-3 to Long Beach, [but] we still feel we can close out every team in the BWC 7-0 if we play well,” Thibodeau. “We are playing more together, we are more focused knowing the Big West [Championships] are coming. We are focused.</p>\n<p>Able to clinch the No. 2 seed in the conference championships, UCSB will likely face Cal State Northridge, who finished seventh in the Big West standings, on Thursday, April 28 at 8 a.m. The championships will take place at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/","id":1090,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1089,1088,1087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Match Marks End of Conf.

They are also 0-1 against nationally ranked pairs.</p>\n<p>In singles, sophomore Molly Reed, a native of Sheffield, England, has led Cal Poly with the most matches won.</p>\n<p>She holds a 6-4 record and has been utilized from the three to the six slots, finding success mostly at the six.</p>\n<p>It will be important for the Mustangs to establish consistent play on the court versus a peaking Santa Barbara team that is currently only behind Long Beach State in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>While UCSB may be favored against Cal Poly, it will embrace a more difficult challenge at Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>The Broncos happen to be riding a two match winning streak. Aside from its wins and losses, Santa Clara seems to have also discovered its identity with a talented depth chart.</p>\n<p>When competing in doubles play, the Broncos currently have a win percentage of .556.</p>\n<p>Leading the team are juniors Nabila Farah and Daniella Silva with an 8-8 dual record all at the one.</p>\n<p>Complementing the pair of juniors are freshman Madison Clarke and senior Chelby Cooke as they possess a 10-4 record at the second slot. However, against nationally ranked doubles competition Santa Clara is 0-2.</p>\n<p>In singles, leading the team is junior Daniella Silva. She is 12-6 overall and presents a versatile skillset that has served as beneficial for the rest of the team as she has found success in matching up with the competition on the one, two, three and four courts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ match at Santa Clara will be their last of the regular season. Currently on a three-match winning streak, UCSB has the opportunity to enhance its momentum heading into the postseason as the Big West Tournament is to begin on Thursday, April 28.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Cal Poly this Saturday, April 16 at 10 a.m. It will have another morning match on Sunday, April 17 at Santa Clara set for a start time of 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 18 of April 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/","id":1087,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1086,1085,1084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miles Seemann: A Long Road to Glory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While performance on the court or field helps make up for wins and losses, the journey of UCSB men's tennis senior Miles Seemann illustrates the importance of staying committed to your dreams no matte...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69850\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69850\" data-attachment-id=\"69850\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/miles-seemann-serves-the-ball-jose-ochoa-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Miles Seemann serves the ball.

Some are home schooled so that they can travel to gain experience and exposure and others come from overseas to join colleges and play in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>For some of the nation’s best, this is a popular and potent route, but in looking at the unique journey of the Gauchos’ senior player, it is clearly not a definite path for all.</p>\n<p>Miles Seemaan is an anomaly. The local player from Solvang, CA has traveled an unbeaten path that began at Santa Ynez High School, which holds a Division IV athletic program.</p>\n<p>“Our conference was very small and I actually ended up being undefeated in both singles and doubles all four years,” Seemann said. “But the High School Public system for tennis doesn’t play as big of a factor as tournaments and tours do, so I didn’t get any offers from DI or DII.”</p>\n<p>Despite not losing a single conference match through high school, Seemann was forced to join a lower division school if he wanted to attend a university. Instead, the young man kept his talents local and joined the Vaqueros at Santa Barbara City College.</p>\n<p>Seemann had made the right choice as in his first and only year at SBCC he played well enough to be ranked No. 2 in doubles and No. 4 in singles play for all California junior colleges.</p>\n<p>As a result of his immediate success, Seemann was discovered by the Gauchos and joined their team as a walk-on, making it to the level that all players dream of after a ride that most couldn’t handle.</p>\n<p>This was just the beginning.</p>\n<p>“Miles was not a player that was on our radar for recruiting out of high school,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “We watched his progress at City College after seeing him play at an interclub match and knowing that he had some talent. Now he has progressed to one of the better doubles players in the country.”</p>\n<p>His decision to attend UCSB was again a fruitful one as not only did he climb to success, but SBCC’s men’s tennis program was cut the following year due to a plethora of these very same cases of one-year players.</p>\n<p>In spite of his timely departure from SBCC’s program, Seemann didn’t settle for the vanquishing of his former tennis team.</p>\n<p>Seemann and Davis helped revive the Vaqueros program this past season, which is just a small testament to the greatness that Seemann brings both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>In his early career with the Gauchos, Seemann played on the lower courts in singles and acted as a strong doubles partner finding success with any pairing. He helped UCSB to a couple of strong seasons before redshirting last year due to back issues. As he entered his final season of collegiate tennis, the true magic began to happen.</p>\n<p>In his senior year, the success started well before dual matches came along. Paired up with a fellow senior player in Nathan Eshmade, Seemann and his partner were entered into one of the state’s most prestigious tournaments, the 59<sup>th</sup> edition of the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships.</p>\n<p>Knocking down several tough, ranked opponents along the way, the duo was crowned in the final round after winning five straight matches.</p>\n<p>“It’s very humbling to see my name alongside of all the great players that have won this tournament and to bring the doubles draw championship to UCSB for the first time,” Seemann said. “Multiple doubles players that have been ranked No. 1 in the world have held this same title and it’s very inspiring.”</p>\n<p>After winning the tournament, Davis asked Seemann to continue working on his two-man game and become a doubles specialist for the team. As the dual match season began, the hard work began to show once more as the duo of Seeman and Eshmade started knocking teams off, even those of the highest caliber.</p>\n<p>“These guys really play tennis the right way, they compliment each other so well, and are just so beautiful to watch,” Davis explained. “At this level you never expect anyone to be a lock and essentially these two have been a lock for us all season playing on court one.”</p>\n<p>In dual match play, this No. 1 Gauchos duo currently holds a 12-4 record having topped two ranked doubles opponents and have won nine of their last ten matches.</p>\n<p>They have only been topped once this season by an unranked opponent and this strong Santa Barbara team has held a ranking of its own throughout a majority of the year that went as high as No. 23 in the nation. Since this ranking, the duo has only lost one match.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just a dream come true to see how well we have played this year,” Seemann said. “It’s been a great journey, I honestly never thought that I would ever be ranked in the nation in Division I doubles and again it is just so humbling to see my name next to all of these great players.”</p>\n<p>Despite not taking the usual route to the highest level of collegiate tennis, through hardwork and dedication Miles Seemann found himself amongst a crowd of the very best. His name is truly etched in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>The journey is not over for this amazing young man whose coaches and teammates had nothing but kind words. Seemann will be playing in his final home match for the UCSB Gauchos tomorrow afternoon and will be honored at the team’s annual senior day alongside partner Eshmade and fellow senior Andrew Riminton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/","id":1089,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1088,1087,1086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Move Up in Big West Standings After Solid Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennis_vsLongBeach-20160402-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennis_vsLongBeach-20160402-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos continue to excel in conference play and now moves to second place in the conference standings with one weekend to go.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a successful inter-conference weekend, the UCSB women’s tennis team improved to second place in the Big West Conference only behind Long Beach State.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69733\" style=\"width: 197px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69733\" data-attachment-id=\"69733\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/stefani-stojic-serves-to-her-opponent-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennis_vsLongBeach-20160402-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stefani Stojic serves to her opponent.

Freshman Nicolas Moreno de Alboran added a final win for the Gauchos on court two defeating his opponent 6-3, 6-2. Winning the match by a score of 6-0 after singles play, the two teams headed into doubles play giving the Highlanders one more chance to get on the board.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would shut down Riverside in doubles play as well winning all three matchups. Rakela joined the doubles lineup for the first time this season playing alongside senior Andrew Riminton. The duo defeated their opponents on court three in a close battle 7-6.</p>\n<p>Another new doubles team in Senior Miles Seemann and Moreno de Alboran took a win on court one 6-3, and the duo of Mays and Holm defeated their opponents 6-2 on court two.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now return home for what could be the team’s biggest match of the season with the conference’s next highest-ranking team, No. 67 UC Davis. The Aggies will come to Santa Barbara boasting a league best overall record of 15-3 and are an undefeated 2-0 in conference. Davis will put up its 12-match win streak against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup with the Aggies will also be the final home match of the year for UCSB and they will honor seniors Eshmade, Seemann, and Riminton.</p>\n<p>The match is set to start at 2pm at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-defeats-tough-big-west-opponent/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-defeats-tough-big-west-opponent/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-defeats-tough-big-west-opponent/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-defeats-tough-big-west-opponent/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-defeats-tough-big-west-opponent/","id":1084,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1083,1082,1081],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 47 Gauchos Prepare For a Two-Match Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos will look to improve its overall record against UNLV and look to improve its perfect 2-0 Big West record when it takes on UCR this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 47 UC Santa Barbara men’s tennis team is set to face a long weekend in which it will face two teams, one home and one away.

Before falling to the Aggies, Riverside had won two straight, defeating both Hawaii and Middlebury.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders struggle in both singles in doubles play as their records in each are below the .500 mark. The only consistent performances on the team’s roster have come from freshman Kyle McCann, who plays primarily on court three for his squad.</p>\n<p>So far this season McCann holds a dual match record of 14-9 and will likely match up with Santa Barbara’s junior co-captain, Morgan Mays.</p>\n<p>“We really want to win Big West a second straight time, and it starts here,” Eshmade explained. “Our ultimate goal is to get back to the NCAAs, but we just have to take things match by match.”</p>\n<p>The match on Saturday with UNLV is set to start at 2 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts. The Gauchos will face UCR in Riverside on Sunday at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-47-gauchos-prepare-for-a-two-match-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-47-gauchos-prepare-for-a-two-match-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-47-gauchos-prepare-for-a-two-match-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-47-gauchos-prepare-for-a-two-match-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-47-gauchos-prepare-for-a-two-match-weekend/","id":1082,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1081,1080,1079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Serve Seventh Place Irvine, First Place Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to improve upon their solid 4-1 Big West record and third place conference standing when it takes on seventh place UCI and first place CSU Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will be hitting the road this week to face two Big West foes, UC Irvine and CSU Fullerton, as it looks to continue its dominant start to conference play.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69452\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"921958633\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69452\" data-attachment-id=\"69452\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/amanda-atanasson-returns-the-ball-to-the-opponent-jenny-luo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atanasson returns the ball to the opponent.

Participating in UCSB’s lone game victory was sophomore Natalia Da Silveira. Da Silveira was one half of a doubles team that won although Santa Barbara lost the opening doubles point.</p>\n<p>While Irvine managed to defeat UCSB in last year’s matchup, the Anteaters possess a youthful roster in which a majority of their players are underclassmen. As a result of this youth, UCI has struggled with establishing consistency on the court.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters have used 18 different duos in doubles play. Nonetheless, in singles play, aside from senior Sarah Gong, every player on UCI’s team has been used in different positions from the two spot to the six.</p>\n<p>The inconsistency may be a contributing factor to such a disappointing season, as thus far the Anteaters sit within the bottom of the pack in the conference standings with their three victories coming against UC Davis, Middle Tennessee and Grand Canyon University.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCI’s consistency woes, CSUF has been one of the conference’s most improved teams. After a seventh place Big West finish last season, 10-12 overall and 2-6 conference record, the Titans are currently on a three-match winning streak with just three matches remaining.</p>\n<p>However, although the Titans have an impressive record, they have played virtually no ranked opposition unlike the other top three teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the last time these two teams played, it did not end well for the Titans. UCSB swept Fullerton 7-0 and could possibly upset the Titans as it is off to an encouraging start.</p>\n<p>“We would hope so [[We would hope [to beat the Titans]]], we have a shot in every position and they have improved a lot and we have as well,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “They are tough. We have to take them very seriously.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton standout junior Alexis Valenzuela is definitely a player to watch out for on the Titans’ side of the court. In singles, she leads the team with a 14-3 dual record and all of those are at the one spot. She is also one half of a fairly tough doubles team alongside junior Camille De Leon, as they both have stringed together a nearly flawless doubles record.</p>\n<p>The pair of juniors have a 12-1 dual record in doubles all at the one slot as well. Valenzuela and De Leon will more than likely need to face off against UCSB’s power duo of junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets, who are currently ranked at the No. 15 spot in the ITA rankings.</p>\n<p>UCSB, with only four matches remaining in the regular season, is currently standing at third in the Big West conference after recently enduring its only conference loss against defending Big West Conference champions Long Beach State last Saturday.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, April 9 the Gauchos will play at UC Irvine at 12 p.m. On Sunday, April 10 UCSB will face off against CSU Fullerton at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/","id":1074,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1073,1072,1071],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Gauchos Defeat CSUN and UCR, Lose 4-3 to No. 67 LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its last home matches of the season, the No. 65 UCSB women's tennis team managed to improve to 4-1 in Big West play with victories over CSUN and UCR despite being edged by No. 67 Long Beach State.

The matadors were 2-2 in the Big West prior to Friday’s match. UCSB did not have an easy time against CSUN but still managed to win 4-3.</p>\n<p>“Northridge is a tricky team to play,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “(CSUN) came in playing pretty well and we started slow but we were able to win the match.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started the month losing the opening doubles point for the first time since dropping to Oregon in Hawaii. No. 16 in doubles Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic lost to juniors Mickey Hsu and Kristen Poei 6-4.</p>\n<p>Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson managed to give the Gauchos a fighting chance by beating sophomore Kiryang Kim and junior Mari Taslagyan 6-2.</p>\n<p>With the doubles point up for grabs, it was between junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada on one side of the net against the Matadors’ junior Vivian Lin and freshman Skyla Alcon.</p>\n<p>In true Big West fashion, the drama did not end there, but rather continued in a back and forth contest. The doubles match gave a glimpse of how the contest would conclude with a narrow ending.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the game ended in favor for Northridge as it squeaked by with the win to grant CSUN its first point of the day, winning by a score of 7-6.</p>\n<p>However, the remaining games went back and forth similar to the last doubles set. The first singles match between Stefani Stojic and Kirsten Poei on court three went fairly quickly as Stojic only conceded one point in two sets, winning 6-1, 6-0.</p>\n<p>The next singles match also went in favor of the Gauchos as Dubavets defeated Vivian Lin on court two by scores of 6-2 and 6-1 to hand the Gauchos a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In response, Northridge’s Alcon managed to tie the match by overcoming UCSB’s Atanasson 6-4 in the first set and 6-2 in the second. With the score knotted at 2-2, the next two events went resulted in a point for each team, leaving the match to be decided by the two players on court six.</p>\n<p>Juniors Jaimee Gilbertson and Mari Taslagyan went all three sets in an intense contest between the then top three teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>Taslagyan won the first set 7-5 but dropped the next two sets. The second finished 7-6(5) and the third 6-4 all in favor of Gilbertson who extended her single’s dual record to 7-6. The match ended with a 4-3 win for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning’s match between reigning Big West Conference champion, No. 67 Long Beach State, and runner up UCSB was a lot closer than any of last year’s encounters were.</p>\n<p>Last season when the two teams met, the 49ers won 6-1 and beat the Gauchos in the conference final 4-1. This time around, the 49ers managed to edge UCSB for a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to win, even though we lost, we feel pretty good on our chances against Long Beach,” Thibodeau said. “We didn’t play well in doubles, lost at five and six. [But], we can surely win next time if we play better at doubles and better at the five and six we can do pretty well. It was still positive to see we lost 4-3. We still have lots of room to improve and this is the closest we have been to beating them”.</p>\n<p>UCSB started slow once again, losing the doubles point quickly having two of the three matches end with a score of 6-2 while the match in which Dubavets and Stojic participated in went unfinished.</p>\n<p>However, as soon as the singles portion of the match commenced, Santa Barbara demonstrated its capability to compete against the 49ers as the Gauchos won three straight to go up 3-1 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>But, the 49ers proved why they were the defending champs as they went on to win three straight in singles to clinch a 4-3 win.</p>\n<p>After another narrow defeat, the Gauchos had one day to turnaround and face one of the weaker Big West Conference opponents in UC Riverside. Head coach Simon Thibodeau managed to rest a few of his starters as the Gauchos were still able to defeat the Highlanders 7-0.</p>\n<p>This weekend helped to foreshadow the competitive race set to take place in the Big West standings as Long Beach State remain atop of the conference with its 6-0 standing and UCSB is at third with its 4-1 record behind another conference undefeated in CSU Fullerton. Fullerton has yet to face Long Beach or Santa Barbara this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/","id":102,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[101,100,99],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 49 Gauchos Takes First Two Conference Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos win first two conference matches of the dual meet season in dominant fashion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past weekend the No. 49 UC Santa Barbara Men’s Tennis team opened up Big West Conference play in the dual meet season.

Santa Barbara opened the match grabbing the doubles point with a 6-1 win on court two from the freshmen duo of Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm and a 6-3 win on court three from junior Morgan Mays and senior Andrew Riminton. The Gauchos would head to singles play with a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the singles round, the lower courts were the first to finish for Santa Barbara as the team took its first two wins on courts six and five. On six, junior Teague Hamilton defeated his opponent dropping just one game with a final score of 6-1, 6-0. On five, sophomore Cody Rakela put up the exact same dominant score to put the Gauchos up 3-0, just one point away from clinching the match.</p>\n<p>Mays would be the one to seal the win for Santa Barbara with a 7-5, 6-0 win on court three and the rest of the Gauchos would follow on the upper courts with sweeping victories to give the team an overall 7-0 outing and its first conference win. With this Santa Barbara improved to 11-6 overall and 1-0 in conference.</p>\n<p>The match with UC Irvine on Sunday was built to be a close contest as the Anteaters owned the conference’s best record at 13-5, and entered Santa Barbara on a seven-match win streak. Despite Irvine’s momentum, the Gauchos would again grab a one sided win, defeating the Eaters 6-1.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened up the match in a similar fashion taking the doubles point and a 1-0 lead over Irvine. Court two was the first to finish as Moreno de Alboran and Holm grabbed their second win of the weekend with a 6-4 score. On court one, the nation’s No. 34 doubles team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann sealed the point with a 6-2 win of their own.</p>\n<p>Singles play was nearly perfect again as the Gauchos won five of the six matches. Hamilton and Rakela found themselves off first once more winning 6-2, 6-2 and 6-4, 6-2, respectively. Moreno de Alboran would seal the match at 4-0 with a 6-2, 6-3 win on court two to give the Gauchos their third straight win.</p>\n<p>The next match would go to the Anteaters on court four and due to Santa Barbara clinching with a fourth point, the final two singles bouts would be decided in an eight-point third set. Mays played on court two and grinded his way to a 6-3, 5-7, 12-10 win. Eshmade played in a thriller of a match on court one and came out on top, defeating a ranked opponent in No. 78 Sebastian Heim 6-2, 3-6, 17-15.</p>\n<p>“Today I was really able to play to my strengths and I was able to get a good win,” Eshmade said. “I really wanted to keep going and play for the fans who all came out see some great tennis and I’m glad we got to finish it out.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take their three-match win streak into the weekend as they will host UNLV in a make-up match from early March. The match is set to start this Saturday at 2pm at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69460\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-49-gauchos-takes-first-two-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69460\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-49-gauchos-takes-first-two-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-49-gauchos-takes-first-two-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-49-gauchos-takes-first-two-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-49-gauchos-takes-first-two-conference-matches/","id":1073,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1072,1071,1070],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Gauchos With Trio of Conference Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering conference play with a three-match winning streak, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to extend its latest winning stretch in its set of conference opening matches at home versus CSUN,...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week has been an eventful one for the No. 65 UCSB women’s tennis team as it returned to the national rankings after beating tough teams during the Spring Break, including No. 39 Fresno State.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-6 overall after winning their last three games with one of those wins coming against the Bulldogs.

CSUN is currently 2-2 and is fourth in the conference standings after defeating UC Riverside and Cal Poly, but losing to Long Beach State 6-1 and CSU Fullerton 5-2.</p>\n<p>Matador standout junior Mickey Hsu is leading the team in wins at 8-7 overall in singles play with all but one of those matches at the first slot. Hsu also is part of CSUN’s best doubles pair along with junior Kristen Poei. Together, they have a 6-8 record in doubles with all the matches played at the one.</p>\n<p>Following the Northridge matchup, the Gauchos will play on Saturday against defending Big West champs Long Beach State. The 49ers are currently tied for first with Cal State Fullerton in the Big West, but have played two more games than UCSB so far.</p>\n<p>The Niners are 4-0 in conference and have been playing well all year long, as evident with their 11-4 overall record. Long Beach has won eight of its last 10, losing only to No. 3 North Carolina State and No. 9 Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this matchup will be a tough contest for both sides, as both teams are only separated by two spots in the national rankings. Even though LBSU boasts a 10-2 record at home, the 49ers are 1-2 away from Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Junior Maeva Razakasoa has reached the no. 60 slot on the national rankings for singles, moving up six places from a week ago. The French native has accumulated an 11-3 dual record all at the one, and has won nine of her last 10 played.</p>\n<p>She is 2-2 against nationally ranked singles players. Razakasoa also is part of a tough doubles team alongside junior Julie Gerrard; together they both are 9-2, winning four straight in doubles, but have not beaten any nationally ranked doubles pair.</p>\n<p>Long Beach also has a nationally ranked doubles duo at the no. 36 spot consisting of juniors Laura Eales and Hayley Thompson. Together, they are 8-2 in duals as a pair with a record of 2-1 against other ranked opposition.</p>\n<p>It will undoubtedly be an interesting matchup between No. 36 and No. 11 in doubles, Gauchos junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will wrap up the weekend against UC Riverside. The Highlanders have struggled this season to find a consistent winning formula as they currently are riding a five-game losing streak with a 3-10 overall record and 0-4 start in conference play.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams played against each other was last year, and it did not go well for UCR as it was swept by UCSB 7-0. Sophomores Lou Adler and Natalie Da Silveira will hope to continue last year’s newfound success. Adler and Da Silveira managed a doubles win, and the young Brazilian earned a singles victory at the one slot last time they played.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be busy for UCSB as it will play against Big West Conference rivals Friday against Northridge at 2:30 p.m., Saturday against Long Beach State 11 a.m. and Sunday versus UC Riverside at 10 a.m., with all games at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 1, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/","id":104,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[103,102,101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 49 UCSB Kicksoff Conference Schedule at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Recently reclaiming its spot in the national rankings, the No. 49 UCSB men's tennis team will welcome Hawaii this Friday and UCI on Saturday to begin conference play.

They will attempt to end an 11 match skid in dual match play this Friday. Irvine owns a 2-3 record on the road, but will be the real challenge for the Gauchos as it holds a 13-5 overall record and is already 2-0 in Big West matches.</p>\n<p>Although the Anteaters are no longer nationally ranked, they have beaten ranked teams this season such as No. 50 Old Dominion. The Anteaters downed the Monarchs quickly by a score of 4-0 back in late January.</p>\n<p>Following its one-sided victory, UCI fell to a couple of tough ranked opponents, but has since bounced back and now ride a seven-match win streak.</p>\n<p>Much of Irvine’s late success has been in part to its number one singles player, sophomore Sebastian Heim, who is the highest ranked singles player in the Big West Conference at No. 78.</p>\n<p>Heim is 10-2 overall in dual match play and is 1-1 against other ranked players having played all 12 matches on court one for his team. The sophomore has taken all but one of his wins in straight set sweeps and ranked as high as No. 55 just a few weeks ago. He will likely match up with Eshmade in Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ recent return to the national standings of No. 49 in the nation is the best in the Big West. The team also sports the highest ranked doubles team in the conference as Eshmade and his partner Miles Seemann currently stand at No. 34</p>\n<p>The duo has won eight of its last nine finishes and will look to give Santa Barbara an early jump in this weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“The consistent work ethic, listening to the coaching staff, supporting each other and everyone doing their part for the team will ultimately give us the best chance to take out the Big West,” Eshmade explained. “Last year, we had a great support group and an incredible amount of team chemistry. This year it is even better, so I’m excited to see what unfolds.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will start their match on Friday at 10 a.m. with Hawaii and at 2 p.m. on Sunday with UC Irvine. Both matches are set to be held at UCSB’s Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 1, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/","id":103,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[102,101,100],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 51 UCSB Avoids Sweep in Non-Conference Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-03-web-e1459146444422.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-03-web-e1459146444422.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having its three match winning streak ended after suffering back-to-back losses to Boise State and LMU, the UCSB men's tennis team managed to get back on the winning track with a 4-3 victory ove...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week the No. 51 UCSB men’s tennis team played three straight non-conference matches to prepare for the Big West season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fell in their first two contests by the same score of 4-3 to both Boise State and Loyola Marymount before bouncing back with a 4-3 win of their own over No. 47 Denver University.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69129\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69129\" data-attachment-id=\"69129\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/morgan-mays-returns-the-ball-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-03-web-e1459146444422.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Morgan Mays returns the ball.

At the end of the four-hour contest, Boise State found themselves on top 4-3 with a walk-off victory on court four.</p>\n<p>The match started in Santa Barbara’s favor as it took the doubles point with wins from some of the team’s veteran players on courts one and three. Junior co-captain Morgan Mays and senior Andrew Riminton were the first off with a dominant 6-2 win on court three.</p>\n<p>The nation’s No. 34 doubles team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann would seal the doubles point and a 1-0 lead for the Gauchos with a close victory of 7-5 on court one.</p>\n<p>Heading into singles play the Gauchos would continue their success as they built upon their lead with two wins on the lower courts. Sophomore Cody Rakela and freshman Oliver Sec both captured straight set sweeps over their opponents on courts five and six, respectively, to start the singles round.</p>\n<p>These two wins put the Gauchos up 3-0 over the Broncos and Santa Barbara would need just one more match to clinch the overall win.</p>\n<p>With their backs against the wall, the Broncos would grind out three straight singles wins on the upper courts to tie the match at 3-3.</p>\n<p>All three wins for Boise State were decided in tiebreakers and extra sets as the team outlasted the Gauchos. With the score tied, the decider would fall on court four where freshman Anders Holm of Santa Barbara faced Boise’s freshman Kyle Butters.</p>\n<p>This final freshman bout would go to three sets, all of which were played in full to the tiebreaker in the end. Holm won the first set with a 7-3 victory in the break, but Butters captured the second in the break 7-5.</p>\n<p>Carrying his momentum from the second, the first year Bronco sealed the match and the upset for his team defeating Holm 6-7(3-7), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-3) overall. His win notched the final score at 4-3 in favor of Boise State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would look to its next match on the road Friday afternoon at Loyola Marymount and in the end found the same results as the team’s previous heartbreak with Boise State. In Los Angeles, the Gauchos looked to bounce back but again were downed by one point as the Lions won 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would again start out the match with a 1-0 lead as it took the doubles point with wins on courts one and three. This was the sixth straight time that the Gauchos captured the doubles round in dual match play.</p>\n<p>The No. 34 team of Eshmade and Seemann defeated its opponents 6-2 on court one and the duo of Mays and Riminton would seal the point with a 6-4 win on three. It has now been 10 matches since Eshmade’s and Seemann’s last doubles loss and they have registered eight wins over that time.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its success early in the singles round winning two of the first three completed matches.</p>\n<p>Rakela added another win on court five, giving him his fifth straight, as he took a one-sided victory of 6-1, 6-2 only dropping three total games in his sweep. After dropping a match on court six, Eshmade added a singles win for his team in sweeping fashion on court one.</p>\n<p>The senior player took a 7-6(7-3), 6-2 win that put the Gauchos up 3-1. Santa Barbara would once again look for just one more singles win to clinch.</p>\n<p>Trailing by two in front of their home crowd, the Lions would rally winning the next three singles matches to give them the overall win over the Gauchos 4-3.</p>\n<p>The final two matches on courts two and three came down to three sets and LMU was able to outlast Santa Barbara, as the nation’s No. 51 team took its second straight loss by one point in walk-off fashion. UCSB would return home to face No. 47 Denver on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The match with the Pioneers was all too similar for the Gauchos, but this time it would be Santa Barbara that came out on top 4-3. This win snapped the team’s two-match skid and could not have been timelier versus a ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got out to a slow start on Easter as they dropped the doubles point falling on courts one and three. The freshman squad of Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran would capture the team’s only doubles win with a 6-4 outing on court two.</p>\n<p>Down 1-0, Santa Barbara would need four singles wins to avoid dropping its third straight dual match.</p>\n<p>The Pioneers claimed the first singles match to build upon their lead, but the Gauchos would answer back winning three straight matches on the lower courts to take the late lead, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Rakela and Sec added straight set wins of 7-5, 7-5 and 7-5, 6-3, respectively on the bottom two courts and Holm would give his team the lead with a 6-2, 1-6, 6-2 win on court four.</p>\n<p>For the third straight time, the Gauchos would look for just one more win in singles play. They turned to courts two and three, where Moreno de Alboran and Mays both played into a third set.</p>\n<p>After dropping the second set on court three, Mays was cold in the start of the third falling behind his opponent 4-1.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, the team’s co-captain would rise winning five straight games to seal both his match and a 4-2 overall win for Santa Barbara, ending its short losing streak. The Pioneers would end the match taking a court two win to set the final score at 4-3 in UCSB’s favor.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will remain at home and will open up Big West Conference play with two matches on the weekend. They will face Hawaii on Friday at 10 a.m. and UC Irvine on Sunday at 2 p.m. Both matches will be held at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/","id":101,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[100,99,98],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Looking to Surpass Even Mark, Face Fresno Today and Boise St. Thursday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-21-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-21-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Approaching the halfway mark of its seven-match home stretch, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to improve its 5-4 home record with matches versus Fresno State today and Boise State on Thursda...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After another disappointing loss against a competitive Harvard side, the UCSB women’s tennis team will have a two-day turnaround to get ready for No. 24 Fresno State today morning and another early duel on Thursday versus Boise State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara owns a 6-6 record with five of its losses coming against ranked opponents and ending by a score of 4-3.

The Bulldogs are 10-5 overall despite having their five-game winning streak snapped against Harvard on Sunday in a 4-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Still, Fresno has managed to win eight out of its last ten matches. Also, against nationally ranked opponents the Bulldogs are 4-4, having recorded victories over No. 28 UCLA, No. 31 Arkansas, No. 58 Washington State, and then No. 56 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Fresno is a place that current UCSB Head Coach Simon Thibodeau used to call home for nine years when he was the Head Coach for the Bulldogs’ women’s tennis team.</p>\n<p>During his time at Fresno he helped accumulate 159 wins and produced a plethora of nationally recognized players including ITA national doubles team of the year in Renata Kucerkova &amp; Anastasia Petukhova. However, this game is just like any other, as the red and black attire he once donned are merely fond memories.</p>\n<p>“All new girls, the assistant, the coach, all new people, but when you see the uniform, the logo, the colors, and ‘go dogs go’ it brings back good memories,’ but it’s just another team,” Thibodeau said. “They are doing a good job, they have a strong number one; it will be a good match. It would be nice to win against a former team but it’s not a rivalry or anything.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps it may not be a rivalry in the traditional sense, but there is nothing like getting a win against a former team. The Gauchos have yet to get a win against the Bulldogs during Coach Thibodeau’s tenure, losing the last two times these two teams met. In last season’s meeting between the programs, the Bulldogs were defeated.</p>\n<p>“We are a different team from last year; we have two players that played at the one and two last year and they are at the five and six this year.” Thibodeau said. “It will be nice to win, at one point. We have been close against everyone, just a matter of getting that extra point. We gotta make sure to finish these close matches.”</p>\n<p>The Fresno State-UCSB dual promises to be a good one with plenty of talent. Most notably, the matchup between the nationally ranked duos of UCSB’s No. 19 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic vs. Fresno’s No. 20 sophomore Mayar Sherif Ahmed and her sister senior Rana Sherif Ahmed will be most intriguing.</p>\n<p>The Ahmed sisters enter with a 14-6 overall record in doubles, winning seven out of their last ten and are 3-3 against nationally ranked pairs. In the singles department, Mayar is No. 34 at 15-9, 5-6 against top ranked opponents. She has earned two consecutive conference player of the week awards along the way. Rana, the senior bulldog, is 10-10 overall with a 4-5 dual record, all at the four slot.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s match against the Bulldogs will take place today at 11 a.m. at the Rec Cen Courts. Its contest versus Boise State is set for this Thursday, March 24 at 10 a.m. PST at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/","id":100,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[99,98,97],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Suffers Second Home Loss of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have lost yet another close match this season after Harvard defeated them 4-3, dropping UCSB to 6-6 overall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team went head to head against the Harvard Crimson on Saturday and suffered its second home loss since February’s matchup against Washington State leaving them with a record of 6-6.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68678\" style=\"width: 145px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68678\" data-attachment-id=\"68678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/lou-adler-hitts-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lou Adler hitts a backhand.

This week was especially tough for Santa Barbara especially because they had to prepare not only for the Crimson, but also against the dreaded end of quarter exams that could have contributed to the team’s performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p1\">“I have to give credit to Harvard they fought at each possession and they are a tough team they beat fresno state, and we didn’t underestimate them,” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau. “Practice was altered due to final exams it was tough to switch gears from finals and back at it. But no excuse. Need more consistency and hang out the court a little longer to make sure we do everything we can.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Crimson undoubtedly have just as a demanding academic responsibility but on the other hand Harvard<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>have now won five straight and have been on the winning end of eight of its last ten matches making up for the slow start to the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They are 3-2 on the road and will be at home to commence Harvard’s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Ivy League Conference contests against Cornell and Columbia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB started Saturday’s matchup strong as it swept in the doubles portion to seal the point. The first to finish was the Gaucho duo consisting of sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson as they defeated senior Amy He and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg 6-3.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adler and Atanasson are 10-6 overall, 6-3 in dual matches, and proving to be an efficient pair but have played mostly at the three spot winning all six matches while losing three times at the two spot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next match ended in the same score as the first as junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada beat freshman Erica Oosterhout and junior June Lee who are 4-8 as a pair. Baker and Yamada on the other hand are 3-2 winning two straight and demonstrating consistency at the second slot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last doubles match to finish was between the 18th best pair in the country against sophomore Annika RIngblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong that were 5-1 together prior to the start of the matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic handed them their second dual loss of the season by beating the Crimson pair 6-4. Stojic and Dubavets are 17-3 overall and 7-1 in dual play, all at the the one for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After securing the first point, Santa Barbara managed to increase its lead by two when sophomore Dubavets beat sophomore Kallenberg in the singles portion of the contest in two sets winning both 6-2. However, UCSB would go on to lose the next four in singles to lose the match.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other half of the powerful Gaucho duo faced off against the sophomore she had just gotten off the court against in doubles. Ringblom and Stojic went all three sets. The first set finished in favor for SB finishing 4-6.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, after winning the first Stojic lost the next two by the scores of 6-4 and 6-3 in a close contest. This match was Stojic’s first coming off an injury where she took three weeks off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It bugs her a little bit more during practice, but she (Stojic) was up 6-4 and it might have been rust seeing as she hasn’t played in three weeks.” Said Coach Thibodeau. “This is not just on stefani but all the matches that could have gone the other way. I believe she will step it up in the future and she is motivated to do so, and I look forward to seeing her do it”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another key matchup was between a highly anticipated encounter between senior Amy He and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira. Both came in with positive singles records and multiple consecutive wins. He and Da Silveira have played consistently at the six and that is where they met on Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a tough and back and forth game He was able to steal the first set winning 7-6. The second set on the other hand, it seems as if He was able to figure out the young Brazilian and continued to get the ball past her six more times as she won 6-1 to give the Crimson its first point of the dual.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After which Harvard went on to carry the momentum from that big win to win the next three as the tide began to turn against the Gauchos after these crucial points went the other way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We are usually strong at the bottom positions. The second set with Natalie i thought she would come back but then was down 4-0.” Said the Santa Barbara Head Coach. “But we have to move forward we have to finish our matches.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Lou Adler defeated junior June Lee in three sets, 6-7,6-3, and 6-1 to grant UCSB its third and final dual point. The match finished 4-3 in favor for the Crimson.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB will have to shake off another close loss and prepare for a quick turnaround as it takes on No. 24 Fresno State on Monday, March 21 at 11 a.m at the Rec Center Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/","id":99,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[98,97,96],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Winning Ways Against Harvard","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has won five straight home matches and looks to extend that streak against Harvard on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team prepares for a tough Harvard team in a match that promises to be an even contest because of the level of competition that both sides have faced up to this point in the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68511\" style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68511\" data-attachment-id=\"68511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/palina-dubavets-hits-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Palina Dubavets hits a backhand.

I just want to play our best and approach the same.” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau.  “We look forward to the upcoming match.”</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB is mixing it up with ten different pairings at doubles, certain players have been consistent throughout, including No. 19 in doubles junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets that are 13-3 together and have won nine out of their last ten. Along with them, recent standout sophomore Natalie Da Silveira.</p>\n<p>The sophomore from Brazil has won four straight and in singles is 7-2 but with a nearly flawless dual record of 6-1. As a sophomore she has proven to be dependable at the five and six slots.</p>\n<p>“Not a big surprise to see her do well at the six she could even be our five or four.” Said the Coach. “One thing i’m most happy with is that she is just getting better and better even after she came back from being inactive for about 6 months. She is solid, feisty attitude that wants to roll the opponent off the court pretty quickly.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Harvard has not been able to find consistency in doubles as it has tried over 15 combinations and pairings but has yet to find a stable group.
