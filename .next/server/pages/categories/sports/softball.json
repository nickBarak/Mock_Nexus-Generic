However, the Gauchos will only lose three players to graduation after this year and the others will return next season after learning from their experiences and improving on the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a 10-42 overall record and a 4-17 conference record, UCSB rounded out the bottom of the Big West, finishing just a game back of seventh place Cal Poly in the standings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season started off strong for the Gauchos, as they emerged victorious in three of their first four games, scoring double-digit runs in two of them. It was after this point that things took a downhill slide as they went on to lose eleven of their next twelve games, and over this stretch they only managed to plate three runs in a game once. This trend of a lack of run support from the offense continued throughout non-conference play as the Gauchos sported a record of 6-25 through their first 31 contests.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into conference play there was some cautious optimism that going head-to-head with their Big West foes might jumpstart the Gauchos and get them rolling again. However, the struggle continued for Santa Barbara as they only managed to grab one win in their first nine Big West matchups. Again, it was the offense that sputtered, as their only win during that time came in the form of a 3-1 win against UC Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were nipping at their first series win but they ultimately let it slip away in heartbreaking fashion against a very good Long Beach State team. After taking the first game of the three-game set, Santa Barbara dropped the next game before letting the series finale slip through their fingers as they surrendered four runs in the bottom of the seventh before ultimately losing the game by a single run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That loss proved tough to recover from as Santa Barbara suffered back-to-back sweeps at the hands of Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside before they bounced back for the highlight of their season, a series win on the road in SLO against Cal Poly. The Gauchos pulled out all the stops in order to record their first series win of the year in their rivals’ backyard, winning the series-clinching game 9-1 in five innings due to the eight-run mercy rule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was lead by their undeniable star Sammy Fabian, as the super-sophomore rode her .404 season average and nine stolen bases to an All-Big West First Team selection, the second All-Conference selection of her young career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Catcher Teah Thies also took home All-Freshman honors for her work behind the plate and team-leading 17 RBI’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos also got significant contributions from junior Devan Sperry, possibly the most consistent UCSB hitter on the season who finished with an outstanding batting average of .308.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Melanie Menor also proved to be a major contributor for the Gauchos, one who got better as the season went along. Menor’s breakout was one of the best stories of the season as she was only batting .116 through 31 non-conference games before she hit her stride in conference play and batted .328 against Big West opponents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB pitching staff was anchored by junior Felisha Noriega, who lead the team with 125.2 innings pitched, a 3.63 ERA, and 81 strikeouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the record might not jump off the page the UCSB softball team has many reasons to be encouraged heading into next season. Some new emerging players coupled with the already-established players easing into their roles as upperclassmen is a recipe for improvement and the hope is that this season is just a necessary bridge to cross before this team is able to consistently compete with the best of the best.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/","id":1681,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1680,1679,1678],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season on High Note, Wins Series Against Mustangs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2019-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Gaucho softball team saved their best for last as they took two out of three games against rival Cal Poly for their first series win of the season.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series began with a doubleheader on Friday, where we saw two close games won by both squads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game one started off well for the Cal Poly, as Lily Amos’s homerun in the bottom of the first got the Mustangs going, and a third inning single by Hailey Martin scored two more runs and put them up 3-0 by the end of the third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That lead held until the fifth inning where the Gauchos came back to tie the game at three with help from an RBI single from Sammy Fabian and a fielding error from Cal Poly that plated two more runs for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game one was coming down to the wire,  and the Gauchos were able to find clutch hits when they needed them as Devan Sperry ripped a two-out bases-clearing double in the top of the seventh to put UCSB up 6-3; they eventually ended up winning by a score of 6-5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game two also stayed close throughout as Cal Poly again jumped out to an early 2-0 lead, thanks to a pair of RBI singles in the second inning. UCSB tied the game up in the third but could not hold on — the Mustangs scored two more runs in the third and another in the fifth to have a 5-2 lead heading into the seventh inning. The Gauchos threatened in the seventh, scoring one run only to line into a double play with the go-ahead run at the plate.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each club securing a win on Friday it meant that the series and season finale on Saturday would be the final chance for UCSB to win a series against a Big West opponent this season, and to do it  against their bitter rival would make it even sweeter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos definitely understood the significance of this game, as they came out red-hot in the first two innings. Devan Sperry started her brilliant 4-4 day with a two-RBI single in the first before Santa Barbara really blew the game wide open in the second with a four-run, five-hit inning thanks to a pair of two-RBI knocks from Sammy Fabian and Devan Sperry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara put up another five-hit inning in the fifth, this time bringing home three runs to push the score up to 9-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly put up one run in the fifth on a Gaucho fielding error, but they were unable to do any more damage as the game was called due to the mercy rule after the fifth inning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho pitching staff was also locked in on the mound in Saturday’s game, as Felisha Noriega and Veronika Gulvin combined to give up three hits and zero earned runs; the game was called after five innings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series marks the end of the 2019 UCSB softball season and in a season that did not go as well as hoped, a series win like this against a rival is something that you can hang your hat on as we look forward to next year.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fairly underwhelming season has left the 8-41 (2-16 in the Big West) UCSB softball team with nowhere to go but up. Coming off a sweep at the hands of UC Riverside in their final home series, the Gauchos will travel to SLO to face the Mustangs and put a stamp on another edition of the Blue-Green rivalry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to UCSB, Cal Poly comes into the final three-game series of the season with not much to play for other than pride, as the Mustangs and Gauchos currently occupy the seventh and eighth positions in the conference standings. Cal Poly has dropped five consecutive games leading up to this weekend’s series, and UCSB has dropped its last eight, which means that this series provides a great opportunity for one of these teams to finish the season on a high note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is difficult to know what to expect from this series because both Cal Poly and UCSB rank in the bottom two in the Big West in terms of runs scored and earned run average, so it will be interesting to see if we get some low-scoring pitcher duels or high-scoring offensive showcases between these two squads. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way the Gauchos could gain an advantage is if their star player, sophomore Sammy Fabian, can keep up her stellar hitting to supply the Gaucho offense with runs. Fabian hit a bit of a rough patch in the middle of conference play, but as the season went on, she found her rhythm again. Fabian led the Gauchos against UCR, going 5-11 in three games against the Highlanders. She has now recorded a hit in seven of the Gauchos’ last eight games and raised her batting average to .390 on the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Fabian, senior Melanie Menor has been very reliable throughout Big West play, as she is currently batting a team best .327 in conference while also leading the team with six RBI’s over that span. Menor is another Gaucho who has upped her play as of late, recording three multi-hit games out of her last five. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitching is one of the areas in which the Gauchos have remained consistent for most of the season. Their 4.50 overall E.R.A. as a staff for the entire season is similar to their 4.45 Big West E.R.A. However, both of these figures place last in the conference, which is a big reason why UCSB has found little success throughout the year. The good news is that Cal Poly’s pitching staff has given up the second-most runs in the Big West, so the Gauchos will not be outmatched against their final opponent of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs also have no hitters with an average above .209 on the season, with junior Hailey Martin’s .267 mark being the closest. Cal Poly does have four players hitting between .243 and .267, however, so there is a bit of depth that has to be accounted for by UCSB pitchers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Cal Poly player that should worry UCSB the most is their ace starter, junior Steffi Best. Best has found a different gear in conference play, as her 3.70 E.R.A. ranks fourth in the Big West over that span. Her record is only 2-8 in Big West play, but she has thrown a complete game in nine of her 10 starts, so she definitely has the stamina to carry the Mustangs for an entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will look to replicate the result of last year’s Blue-Green rivalry, during which they took two out of three games from the Mustangs in Santa Barbara.

The Matadors outscored the Gauchos 21-7 over the course of three games and never trailed over that stretch. The pressure of playing from behind combined with solid pitching performances by CSUN put UCSB at a major disadvantage for the duration of the series.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game one on Saturday was the most lopsided game of the entire series, as CSUN was able to score five runs on six hits in the top of the first inning to basically solidify the outcome from the start. Northridge’s bats were cooking the whole time as they finished with 13 hits as a team and with five players producing more than one hit. On the other side, Santa Barbara only managed six hits as a team; Sammy Fabian was the only Gaucho to record more than one hit as she went 2-4. The Matadors extended their lead to 8-0 in the fifth inning before RBI’s from Teah Thies and Devan Sperry brought the lead to 8-2 in favor of CSUN. The lead eventually ballooned back to 10-2 before the game ended and Northridge took a comfortable 1-0 series lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second game played out in a very different way than the first but with a similar outcome. No runs were scored through the first three innings as Veronika Gulvin of UCSB and Kenedee Jamerson of CSUN both seemed comfortable early on. Northridge ended up striking first, putting up one run in the fourth and fifth innings due to a single and a sacrifice play. Santa Barbara then immediately responded as a Maci Finessingle and Melanie Menor double tied up the score at 2-2. Unfortunately, the Gauchos’ comeback effort fell short when CSUN put up three runs on four hits to go up 5-2 in the sixth inning and as UCSB did not record a hit for the rest of the game, ultimately falling in the second game of the back-to-back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series finale on Sunday continued the trend of the Matadors grabbing an early lead as they found themselves up 5-0 after four innings with the Gauchos having yet to record a hit against Jillian James, the ace of CSUN’s pitching staff. UCSB was finally able to retake the momentum and put some fear into CSUN for the first time all game as they racked up three runs on five hits in the bottom of the fifth, forcing a pitching change with the tying run at the plate. Still, the Gauchos were unable to come all the way back as Kenedee Jamerson came in and staved off the Gaucho comeback effort. The Matadors put up one more run in the sixth inning to extend their lead back to three, which proved to be insurmountable for Santa Barbara as they went on to win by a score of 6-3 and clinched the series sweep in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will face UC Riverside next weekend in their final home series of the season, starting with a doubleheader at

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB softball team will look to bounce back from a tough series loss last weekend as they take on Cal State Northridge in a three game series starting on Saturday. The Gauchos are reeling from a devastating series loss in which they let Long Beach come back in the final game to steal the win away from them. However, they did take a step in the right direction with a pair of solid offensive outputs over their last three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their upcoming opponent, CSUN, is looking to pick up some momentum as we head down the stretch in conference play after earning their first Big West series win of the season against Cal Poly last weekend. The Matadors are 5-7 in the Big West which puts them in a tie for fifth with UC Riverside, while the Gauchos are still sitting in last place, with their 2-10 conference record placing them just one game behind Cal Poly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to build on what was a stellar offensive series in Long Beach where they scored five runs or more in two of the three games, a feat that they had not accomplished once in conference play before then. One of the main reasons for the Gauchos’ offensive outbreak was junior infielder Devan Sperry’s arguably best series of the season, going 5-11 with multiple hits in two of the games; she became a much-needed contributor to a team that desperately needed more run production. Sophomore infielder Maci Fines also had a stellar series as she recorded a hit in each game, solidifying herself as one of the most consistent producers on the team. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An encouraging note for UCSB is that sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian is due to get back to her old ways and start hitting again as she has cooled off after she was nearly unstoppable earlier in the year. Fabian is hitting .397 on the season but just .250 in conference play, as she has been unable to put together consistent at-bats as of late. This is encouraging for the team because they seem to be improving on offense even with their best hitter being in a bit of a slump. If she can break out along with the rest of her teammates, the Gauchos might be able to peak near the end of the season and surprise some folks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge also has some positive momentum going their way, however, as they were able to claim their first Big West series victory of the season mainly due to the great work of their pitching staff. Northridge is not the deepest squad in the Big West by any means; however, they have a pair of quality pitchers to look out for along with possibly the most dangerous hitter in the entire conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN has two pitchers that rank in the top 10 in the Big West in terms of E.R.A. Sophomore Kenedee Jamerson’s 3.19 mark puts her at ninth overall, and sophomore pitcher Jillian James and her 2.15 E.R.A. is good for fourth in the league. James is the clear ace of the staff, as she leads the entire conference in innings pitched, with 172.1,  and she is also second overall with 187 strikeouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the pitchers, the one person who the team should gameplan for is junior outfielder and pitcher Megan Stevens, who bats .455 on the season with 47 runs batted in. These stats, paired with her 12 home runs on the season, demonstrate the power and skill of Stevens, but it is more important to stress that no one else on her team hits over .300, so if the Gaucho pitchers can neutralize her, they will put themselves in a position to win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three-game set begins with a Saturday doubleheader starting at 1 p.m.

With this series in the books, UCSB still finds themselves in last place in the Big West with a conference record of 2-10 to go along with their 8-35 mark for the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday night doubleheader started out well for the Gauchos as they bested Long Beach by a score of 6-2. A brilliant outing from junior pitcher Felisha Noriega was a major factor in the Gauchos’ win as she threw 4.2 innings and allowed no runs to score on only two hits given up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noriega was given an immediate three-run cushion from her offense in the first inning, something that that Gauchos have struggled to do all season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three first-inning runs were scored by bases-loaded walks given up by Long Beach pitcher Devyn Magnett, as the Gauchos succeeded in putting considerable early pressure on a LBSU pitching staff that has struggled as of late. UCSB scored another run in the top of the third on a sacrifice fly by senior infield Melanie Menor to make it 4-0 Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three Gauchos, sophomore infield Maci Fines, junior infield Devan Sperry and junior infield Kayla Krantz, recorded multiple hits in an offensive outburst by Santa Barbara. Both teams put up a run in the sixth and seventh innings before a popup with runners on second and third ended the game for Long Beach, and UCSB hung on to win 6-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second game of the evening ran less smoothly for UCSB as they were unable to contain Long Beach’s offense any longer, falling to the 49ers 6-1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos could not find the spark they had in the game before as they only recorded five hits as a team, as opposed to the 10 hits they had in the previous game. Long Beach was up 2-0 after the second inning thanks to a solo homer by Nichole Fry in the first, followed by an RBI single by Katelyn Hanson in the second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams were then quiet until the fifth inning where Fry racked up another RBI on a sacrifice fly to give the 49ers a 3-0 advantage late in the game. UCSB threatened in the sixth as they brought the tying run to the plate but were only able to cut the deficit to 3-1 in favor of Long Beach. A pair of homers for LBSU in the sixth put the game away for good as Maddy Ruffin and Taylor Rowland both went yard for the final runs of the game to secure a 6-1 Long Beach win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final game of the three-game set proved to be the most entertaining of the series, as UCSB used a four-run fourth inning to propel themselves to a 5-0 advantage entering the fifth. The Gauchos put up their runs thanks to three one-run singles and a two-run double by Fines, and they looked to have broken away from Long Beach for the second time in three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers threatened in the fifth and loaded the bases in the sixth, but only managed to score two runs and cut the deficit to 5-2. That is before a nightmare inning for UCSB allowed Long Beach to score four runs off of three walks, a hit by pitch, a sac fly and two singles, culminating with a walk-off two-run single by Maddy Ruffin to seal the deal and win the series for LBSU by a score of 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will look to bounce back against Cal State Northridge as they return home to play a three-game series against the Matadors next Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will look to bounce back from a series sweep at the hands of Hawaii as they travel down to Long Beach to play their next series against Long Beach State. UCSB’s 7-33 overall record and 1-8 conference record puts it in eighth place in the Big West, while LBSU sits in fifth place with a 17-21 overall record and a 4-5 record in conference. Both teams are still trying to gain some positive momentum as they get deeper into Big West play, as LBSU has only won one series in conference play so far, while UCSB is still looking for its first series win of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will ride the bats of Sammy Fabian and Maci Fines in the hopes of finally breaking out on offense, as they have yet to score more than three runs in any Big West matchup so far this season. Sammy Fabian’s bat has cooled off slightly from an incredible .473 non-conference average to just .286 since the start of conference play, but she did go 3-9 in the last series against Hawaii and was just one of two Gauchos to record a multiple hit game against the Rainbow Wahine. Sophomore Maci Fines has also solidified herself as one of the more consistent hitters in UCSB’s lineup, as she has held steady throughout the whole season and is second on the team with a .250 batting average in conference play. If Santa Barbara wants to show some improvement and win more games down the stretch, it will need more hitters to step up and produce, because by only scoring 10 runs in its first nine conference games, the pitching staff has fielded a lot of pressure to keep games within reach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run support and strong outings from the pitchers will be especially key for the Gauchos as they try to slow down arguably the best offense in the Big West. LBSU has four hitters inside the top 15 in terms of batting average in the conference, all hitting above .336 on the season. The Beach’s lineup is spearheaded by Jamie Wren, whose .367 batting average ranks seventh in the Big West. She also ranks in the top 10 in runs, hits, doubles, home runs, RBIs and total bases. As a team, Long Beach ranks first in overall batting average, hits and doubles, and it has proven to be elite at putting the ball in play as it has the least amount of strikeouts in the entire conference. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will have to look to exploit Long Beach’s pitching staff, which has been its most notable weakness on an otherwise well-rounded team. Through nine Big West games, Long Beach ranks last in terms of combined ERA at 4.63, as opposed to UCSB, whose 3.56 mark ranks sixth in the conference. LBSU has a potent offense that can put up runs in a hurry, but its pitching staff has been unable to keep opponents at bay, and that is where it is limited as a team. Long Beach has given up five or more runs in five of its nine conference games, and it has a 1-4 record in those games. If there is any team that UCSB’s offense can break out of its slump against, it is a team like Long Beach that has had a lot of difficulty limiting the scoring of its opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will look to gain some momentum on the road before returning home for two consecutive series following this one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series against Long Beach will begin with a doubleheader on Friday, April 19, with the first game starting at 1 p.m., followed by the series finale on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version

Fabian was 1-3 on the day and one of six Gauchos that recorded a base hit. UCSB carried their 1-0 lead into the fifth inning, where they managed to get runners on second and third with no outs but failed to score and extend their lead. The potent Hawai’i offense was then able to make the Gauchos pay for failing to take advantage of the opportunity by putting up four runs in the bottom half of the inning. The bulk of the damage was done by the Big West’s homerun leader Callee Heen, whose twelfth big fly of the season put the Rainbow Wahine up 4-1. This proved to be too big a hole for the Gauchos to climb out of. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both games in the next day’s doubleheader followed similar patterns of Hawai’i grabbing an early lead and never relinquishing it, as the Rainbow Wahine took both Saturday games by scores of 3-1 and 5-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first game of the day saw Hawai’i take a 3-0 lead through the third inning before allowing their pitching staff to do the heavy lifting down the stretch by only allowing one run from UCSB’s hitters. The one run scored by the Gauchos came on a sixth inning single by Devan Sperry that scored Maci Fines, who had two hits in the game. As the Gauchos loaded the bases in the top of the seventh, Santa Barbara did make Hawai’i sweat it out down the stretch </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> only for Sammy Fabian to fly out with the game-tying run in scoring position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third game of the series and the second game of the day, the Rainbow Wahine carried over their momentum from their earlier win as they scored four runs in the first inning off of three singles and a bases-loaded walk. Hawai’i would hold their lead for the rest of the game behind a strong outing from pitcher Izzy Dino who only allowed four hits and two runs en route to a complete game, improving her individual record to 9-5. The two runs for the Gauchos both came in the seventh inning after things had more or less been decided, with an RBI single from Rayna Cohen who later scored on a fielding error by Hawai’i. Sammy Fabian led Santa Barbara on offense as she had two of the Gauchos four hits on the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1-8, the Gauchos find themselves sitting in last place in the Big West Conference at this point in the season and with an upcoming series against 4-5 Long Beach State, they will look to improve that record against another squad that has yet to find its way so far in conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will play their next game on Friday, April 19 in Long Beach as part of a doubleheader before playing in the series finale on the following Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

On the other side, the Rainbow Wahine have won four games in a row, including a series sweep on the road against Cal Poly. Hawai’i is 5-1 in the Big West and 24-10 overall, good enough to tie Cal State Fullerton for first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to find success in this series they will have to limit the powerful offensive attack of the Rainbow Wahine with strong outings from each of their starters. Hawai’i’s lineup is littered with power hitters which makes them extra dangerous and taxing on the arm of any starting pitcher.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lead by Callee Heen and Nicole Lopez, Hawai’i leads the Big West in runs per game at 5.29, as well as in home runs with 35. Heen and Lopez have 11 and 10 dingers respectively, but their lineup consists of four players who bat above .300 and nine players who have at least one home run. One more stat to consider when looking ahead to this series is that the 180 runs scored by Hawai’i this season more than double the 88 scored by Santa Barbara, which again conveys that in order for the Gauchos to keep pace, they will have to limit the offensive output of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ lone win against UC Davis they were lead by Veronika Gulvin who only allowed four hits and one run in a complete game to earn her first win of the season. This will likely be the formula for success for UCSB as their offense has struggled recently by failing to put up more than three runs in 10 consecutive games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would benefit if one or more hitters had a breakout series as no one in their lineup has been able to find a groove so far in conference play. Sammy Fabian, UCSB’s leading hitter throughout this season, still sports a .427 overall batting average this season, but her numbers have dipped to just .263 in conference play, and if she can right the ship the team will be in a much better position to win games. The Gauchos have only managed to score four total runs in their six conference games with only two extra base hits in that span, and they will need all the run support they can get to keep up with a potent offensive team like Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>Hawai’i has two pitchers who have thrown 182.2 of 223 total innings for the Rainbow Wahine, the first being Brittany Hitchcock, who ranks in the top five of the Big West in ERA, wins and strikeouts. She is one of two starters for UH with the other being Izzy Dino, who has thrown 77.2 innings and ranks seventh in ERA at 2.57. On the other side, Santa Barbara’s pitching staff has found increased success in conference play with a solid 3.09 ERA in six games. Felisha Noriega and Veronika Gulvin pitch the majority of the innings for the Gauchos and while they do not have top 10 ERA’s like Hawai’i’s pitchers, they are both capable of putting together a solid outing and putting their team in a position to win. This series will most likely be decided by whichever club’s pitching staff can stay composed and allow their offense to back them up.</p>\n<p>The three-game series will begin Friday, April 12 at 9 p.m. PST in Honolulu.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87380\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87380\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/","id":1275,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1274,1273,1272],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Searches For First Big West Win, Takes On Aggies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2019-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The last-place women's softball team will be looking for their first conference win this weekend as they get set to host the UC Davis Aggies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82971\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"938826145\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87130\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82971\" data-attachment-id=\"82971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/freshman-10-maci-fines-transition-to-the-college-game/maci-fines-slap-hits-in-an-attempt-to-get-on-base-dustin-harris-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1376&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1376\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maci Fines slap-hits in an attempt to get on base.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to get back on track after being swept in their conference opener against Cal State Fullerton. The Gauchos are currently on an extended losing streak of 12 games, while on the other side the Aggies had won eight in a row before losing to Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season has been a struggle so far for UCSB after beginning the year on a high note. They won three of their first four games, but the season has gone downhill since then. Their 0-3 conference record, along with their 6-28 overall record, puts them last in the Big West at this point in time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the season has been a struggle so far for the Gauchos, things seem to be looking up for them. They performed impressively against a very good Cal State Fullerton team — the score was tight in every game of the last series, even forcing extra innings in the second of their three game set. There is still a lot of time left in this season and much room for the Gauchos to improve.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, UCSB has been led by sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian, whose .444 batting average places her at second in the entire Big West Conference. She also slugs .485 and has proven to be a tough contender at the plate, with only six strikeouts out of 99 at-bats this season so far. She has a record of six stolen bases, ranking her top five in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos pitching staff is led by junior Felisha Noriega, who boasts a 5-12 record in her 22 appearances. In 87.1 innings pitched, Noriega has posted a stellar 3.37 ERA with six complete games and K/BB ratio of 55/46. Noriega will be the key to UCSB’s success as the longer she is able to go, the better chance they have of sticking around and — possibly — upsetting UC Davis. The rotation is rounded out by Veronika Gulvin, who has an ERA of 4.81, and Emily Schuttish, who has an ERA of 5.74.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, UC Davis’s successful season has been due to an elite pitching staff and a top-heavy lineup full of great hitters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the way at the dish for the Aggies is Senior Meghan Bradbury, who is batting .312 and a major power hitter. She is fourth in the Big West and first on her team with 29 RBI’s, along with seven dingers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Bradbury is not the only slugger in the lineup for the Aggies. Their team includes four starters recorded as batting above .300 and six starters hitting over .275. This combination provides a tough challenge that can wear down any opposing pitcher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is able to rely on their hitters to win games, but their elite pitching staff is arguably the biggest reason they’ve earned one of the best records in college softball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Brooke Yanez has been one of the best pitchers in the country this season as her 1.08 ERA and 164 strikeouts are each good enough to lead the Big West in each respective category, while also placing top ten in the entire country. Yanez is backed up by senior Sara Cadona, who is second in the conference with a 1.91 ERA, and by junior Katie Kibby, whose 2.69 ERA is good for seventh in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis’s deeply talented pitching staff has been the key to their success this season, and UCSB will have to really fight in order to win against one of the Big West’s elite teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series will kick off with a doubleheader on Saturday, April 6.

Fabian currently owns a .467/.500/.567 split statline and has significantly bolstered the Gauchos’ offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She leads the team in hits (14), doubles (3) and runs (6), and has also been very solid on the defensive end as well. While it would be almost impossible to maintain such a high level of production throughout the season, her play so far could very well be a spark plug for the rest of the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of defense, pitcher Emily Schuttish has been off to a deceptively strong start. Although she currently has a 1-2 record, she already has one save and a complete game to go along with her team-leading 2.14 ERA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since senior Veronika Gulvin has struggled on the mound to start off her final year as a Gaucho, Schuttish will likely be seeing more playtime as the season goes on which could end up being a blessing in disguise for the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the players on the team will definitely have to pick up the pace if they hope to pick up some wins this weekend however.

Her nearly 40% batting average over wins is a full ten percent higher than her .278 batting average during losses.</p>\n<p>Much of the success that Altmeyer had at the plate this year came on the back of fellow infielder Alyssa Diaz who hit in the three spot all year right in front of her complimentary second baseman. Pitchers struggled with Altmeyer in the clean-up because Diaz has such a staunch reputation for getting on base, thus giving Altmeyer so many opportunities to drive in runs.</p>\n<p>While the first baseman Diaz played in all but the final seven games of the season, she assumed a premier leadership role on the team in just her second year as she slashed .325 on the year and turned it on during conference play to improve her average to .357 against Big West foes.</p>\n<p>All five of Diaz’s home runs came during the non-conference half of the season and nearly 78% of her RBIs were against out-of-conference competitors. Nonetheless, the second-year standout was named to the all-conference second team for the second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>Much like Diaz, we saw an influx of outstanding contact hitting from freshman infielder Maci Fines during conference play. The first year began her breakout season at third base but shifted over to the shortstop spot toward the end of the year as sophomore third baseman Kayla Krantz returned from an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>Fines was awarded All-Freshman team honors for the Big West Conference considering her all-star worthy .380 batting average during Big West competition in 2018. Fines ability to read the ball well lead her to the least number of strikeouts between active batters on the UCSB roster as she only got rung up 9 times this season.</p>\n<p>Her batting average and aggressiveness gradually increased as she became more comfortable at the plate in the latter half of the season.</p>\n<p>While Fines hit .231 and .217 respectively in the first of the season, she bettered her batting to .350 in April en route to shining from an outstanding performance in May in which she smacked .458 over a 6-game stretch. In fact, Fines took a six-game hitting streak into the final match against Cal Poly while four of those six games resulted in multi-hit contests for the first year.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian rounds off the list of Gauchos with All-Big West honors as she too earned a spot on the Freshman All-Conference team. Fabian was the sunshine on this team’s season-long cloudy day that was unfortunately covered up by a plethora of other struggles going on with the Gauchos this year.</p>\n<p>Fabian began her career with UCSB this season batting .433 through the first 12 games. She led her fellow ‘Chos in batting average for the majority of the season finishing with a team-high mark of .335 for the year.</p>\n<p>While the three other players that earned honors were the most appealing during Big West play, Fabian boasted early and dominated during non-conference play. The freshman flashed a .356 average to start off the year and notched her way up to fourth in the Big West in steals with 9.</p>\n<p>Yet, when it came to conference competition, Fabian wasn’t nearly as effective. She walked less and struck out more, but what might have hindered her the most was the team’s failure to give Fabian the green light on the base path.</p>\n<p>With the resounding speed and aggressiveness she displayed during the former half of the season, it was surprising how she didn’t steal one single base during conference play. Worst of all though, Fabian was never given the chance on the base path during Big West play. She was signaled to steal zero times after an impeccable first half of her season she spent running all over catchers.</p>\n<p>With only three seniors graduating this year, the Gauchos plan to bring back virtually the whole team in the 2018-2019 season and get a taste of redemption after struggling to win only a third of their games this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

‘Chos rolled over a sliding Cal Poly squad to close out their rough season on a high note. UCSB bested the Mustangs in games one and two of the series by scores of 10-9 and 5-4 respectively before ultimately dropping the series finale to Cal Poly with a 5-1 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished the year with 20 wins and 34 losses, a disappointing downfall after the 31-28 season that the Gauchos completed during the 2017 season. Not only did the Gauchos lose 63% of its games this season, but UCSB finished in the eighth and final place of the Big West Conference with a 7-14 conference record, coming out on top in only one third of interleague contests.</p>\n<p>With the series loss, Cal Poly dropped to 25-25 overall, 9-12 in conference play to finish in the fifth spot in the Big West Conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the shadow hanging over Santa Barbara’s season may be gloomy, UCSB looked fairly dominant in its final series of the 2018 season.</p>\n<p>The series opener slipped in the Gaucho’s favor after huge run production in the sixth and seventh innings to send the contest into extra innings. Some late-game heroics by junior shortstop Melanie Menor drove in the winning run on a walk off single in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a 10-9 standoff as the infamous Blue-Green Rivalry kicked off for the final time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara carried over this momentum into the Saturday doubleheader and managed to perform on a supreme level in the first game of the day as the Gauchos displayed overwhelming power at the plate that has been lacking for much of the year.</p>\n<p>A first inning 3 RBI double by sophomore first baseman Hailey Martin propelled the Mustangs out in front early, but junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer had an immediate answer come her first plate appearance of the day.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer responded with a 3-run jack of her own to even up the game at 3-3, her seventh bomb of the year.</p>\n<p>Complimented by a solo shot by sophomore center fielder Rayna Cohen, the Gauchos were tied at 4 runs a piece heading into the bottom of the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Boosted by a walk-off single in game one of the series, UCSB felt confident with their cleanup hitter stepping up to the dish with 2 outs in the final inning of play.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer blasted her team-best 8th long ball of the 2018 season to walk-off Santa Barbara in dramatic fashion with a 5-4 win and pull out the team’s first series win since mid-April. This homerun marks UCSB’s third walk-off hit in conference play on the year.</p>\n<p>The second base standout has turned it on in the final stretch of the season going 4-9 in the last series of the year with 2 deep bombs and 5 RBIs as she improved her batting average to .323 in her third season with Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos raked senior ace Lindsey Chalmers on two appearances over the weekend as she longed for the ever-coveted 20-win mark. The only thing standing in her way was the hidden power displayed from UCSB bats.</p>\n<p>Chalmers was limited to 8.2 innings pitched over two starts and allowed 11 runs in the process. She finished with an 8.99 ERA over the course of the three-game series dropping her holistic season earned run average to 2.57 as she was unable to come up victorious in either of her two starts. The righty ended the season with 19 wins and 9 losses, nonetheless good for second most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While the first two games decided the outcome of the series winner, Cal Poly didn’t complacently lay down in the team’s season finale.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing as Rayna Cohen drove in sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez to thrust ahead in the bottom of the first inning.</p>\n<p>From there, both offenses remained silent until Poly erupted for a 5-run fourth inning which caused sophomore southpaw Felisha Noriega to see her day come to an end.</p>\n<p>For the next 3.1 innings, junior right-handed pitcher Veronika Gulvin maintained composure by allowing only 1 hit in her final appearance of the year.</p>\n<p>Gulvin hasn’t particularly lived up to each and every expectation this season, yet this past weekend she shined bright and previewed some special talent that we look forward to seeing next season. The junior threw 6.2 innings over two appearances against the Mustangs allowing only 1 run throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Gulvin was dominant, she didn’t receive much help from the offense as UCSB dropped its final game of the series by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitching struggled immensely this year as three of the four active pitchers culminated their seasons with ERAs over 5.0.</p>\n<p>Yet the future is bright for UCSB! We saw promising performances from many young and well-rounded players. Freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian finished off her year with a team-best .335 batting average and displayed sheer and dominant speed early in the season. I would love to see more aggressive baserunning in conference play from Fabian since finished fourth in stolen bases in the Big West, although all of the steals came prior to Big West play.</p>\n<p>Inversely, freshman infielder Maci Fines was unreal come conference play. She started out the year batting roughly .229 in the former half of the season, but once she started to compete with Big West teams, the third baseman began to produce at exponentially high levels. She hit a near .400 in Big West play which rose her batting average on the year to .290.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also have young help in the circle. Freshman pitcher Emily Schuttish came alive in the latter half of the season as she was the go-to starter for conference play. Her most prominent month of starts came during April in which UCSB saw a rise in strikeouts per 7 innings from 3.72 to 4.70. Schuttish only saw .1 innings worth of time in the circle during May and we saw a destructive increase in ERA as it rose from 3.81 in April to 8.08 in May.</p>\n<p>There should be more of Schuttish next season as the ace on this Gaucho team.

The Mustangs are riding a momentous wave of pride after defeating No. 17 Cal State Fullerton, the leaders in the Big West conference, 3-0 last Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They currently rank fourth in conference, winning eight out of the 18 total games so far. Though they lost their latest series, their performance this weekend put the team at a 24-23 overall record, pushing their game percentage over the .500  mark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, the Gauchos have no reason not to leave everything out on the field on Friday and Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With combined efforts from stand-out Big West players like Maci Fines, Sammy Fabian and Emily Schuttish, Santa Barbara has the potential to finally turn the tide for themselves. The three freshmen threaten opponents from all directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fines’s and Fabian’s combined success at the plate totals 43 hits so far; that translates to just below a third of the hits produced by the nine-person lineup in conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the mound, Schuttish has proven to have matured immensely since Big West play came around, even when the games ended up being devastating losses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her latest appearance happened against former competitor UC Riverside, whose 13 runs admittedly threw a wrench into her mojo last Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the games she has thrown all seven innings, however, the pitcher has held opponents to five runs or less. She holds onto the lowest in-conference ERA in the SB bullpen at 4.42. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, though, it would be unfair to leave out Cal Poly’s contributions to this equation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s “low” 4.42 ERA exceeds that of three out of four of the SLO’s pitchers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior powerhouse Lindsey Chalmers will undoubtedly bring the heat should she face SB this weekend. The right-handed vet boasts a 19-9 pitching record while keeping her ERA down low at 2.24 overall and at an even lower 1.39 in conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her consistent success earned her back-to-back Big West Conference Pitcher of the Week awards, the first a result of Chalmers’s first no-hitter. She beat out Santa Barbara’s Felisha Noriega that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not Cal Poly throws Chalmers or not, Santa Barbara’s offense must be alive and ready to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Santa Barbara typically produces the baserunners they need, their efforts at the plate lately have not extended to producing the runs needed to win. However, their failure to close out games is also due to the lack of consistency in the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the onset of the season in February, there have been just nine games in which the Gauchos have gone error-free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past two series alone, UCSB committed 14 defensive mistakes, and while this is by no means entirely to blame for their recent losses, it does take a big toll on the team’s success rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tightening up the defensive game can especially play a crucial role against a team like Cal Poly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though its offense is consistent enough to turn out wins, its game records reveal a very low-scoring pattern. In only one of the Mustangs’ eight wins in Big West so far have they scored more than five runs against an opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparatively, though they have won only five games, SB scored above five runs in three of those five wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has the drive, the capability, the potential for success; it has peaked on the field and at the plate all season. And though the end of the season crept quickly behind the shadows of loss after loss, Friday and Saturday grant the Gauchos a final attempt at proving themselves as fierce competitors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes their closing series back home to Santa Barbara at Campus Diamond beginning Friday at 3 p.m. followed by a double header on Saturday starting at 1 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After losing the first game by two in an exciting 13-11 loss, the Gauchos seemed lost out on the field in the last two games. They seemed to let the 9-3 loss yesterday affect their play, as they came out of the gates Sunday seemingly unprepared to face a newly confident Highlander team.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat, the Gauchos seemed to be outmatched. After the Gauchos only got one hit in the first inning, the Highlanders came out ready to swing, getting three hits, one short of UCSB’s total on the day.</p>\n<p>The three hits helped bring in a run, and Hannah Rodriquez also came home off of a wild pitch. After a second inning where the Highlanders scored two runs off of a double by Hannah Rodriquez double, the Gauchos were still within striking distance. However, the Highlanders put the game away in the bottom of the third.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the Gauchos still scoreless, the Highlanders started to roll, and circled through their whole rotation while also bringing in 6 runs. From there, both sides seemed to sense the inevitability of the contest, and two innings later, it was over.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were buoyed by their starting pitcher Taylor Misfeldt, who allowed only 4 hits on her way to earn her 17th win on the season, the most on her team.</p>\n<p>On the Gaucho side, sophomore Felisha Noriega took the start for the day. Unfortunately, she didn’t get very far, letting up 4 runs in the first and second inning, and was relieved by junior Veronika Gulvin. With this loss, Felisha dropped below .500, going 6-7 on the year.</p>\n<p>The substitutions didn’t fare much better, as both Veronika and her replacement, senior Lena Mayer, let up 5 runs. Veronika was pulled during the third inning, after her fifth run came in on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>With Lena now pitching in the bottom of the third, she let up a wild pitch, which brought in a run, but was able to end the inning. However, she let up an additional four more runs in the fourth inning, and with head coach Brie Galicinao electing not to put in any more pitchers, Lena ended the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, there weren’t many bright spots for the Gauchos. One of the lone positives for the Gauchos was sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez, who continued to swing well, getting two hits. However, with 6 of her Gaucho teammates going hitless, the offense was absent.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, no one individual stood out, but the team as a whole hit well. Three people had two hit games, and four people had two runs. Danielle Ortega did seem to shine brightest amongst the stars, with a triple in the third inning that cleared three runs in and seemed to seal the game. The Highlanders were simply much more potent on offense, and the Gauchos did not seem to have an answer.</p>\n<p>Ending the series on a 14-0 loss, the Gauchos hope to recover against Cal Poly this weekend, where they play a Mustangs team that is 8-10 in conference play and coming off a Cal State Fullerton win. The Mustangs should get some confidence from that, considering that was only Fullerton’s second loss of Big West play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly comes to UCSB this weekend, with the first game on Friday, and the doubleheader on Saturday. This will be the Gauchos last series of the year, and we’ll see if they can go out on a good note.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/","id":28,"author":{"id":258,"name":"Andrew Strauss"},"related":[27,26,25],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/sports/softball","highestPage":13}},"__N_SSG":true}
