The Gauchos started the game with a goal from senior utility Chase Racich early in the first quarter, but USC then took control and never let go, with three goals in the first quarter followed by six in the second to give the Trojans a 9-2 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was a close battle as the Gauchos held the Trojans to only two goals while scoring two of their own from junior attacker Bryan Snyder and junior attacker Kevin Cappon, his second of the game. The game ended 14-5 after a goal from freshman attacker Josh Jordan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to make up for their loss the prior day as UCSB fell to Long Beach St. 14-12 in another close game between the two evenly matched teams. Their previous encounter saw the Gauchos win in sudden death overtime 14-13, but they weren’t able to pull through yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“For me I think we lost the game in the first half,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up two or three really easy goals to them. One was a rebound goal that we should have boxed out and got the rebound, and then another one we were trying to get out of the half and we committed an offensive foul to give them a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>After Long Beach went up 1-0, the Gauchos countered with a goal from Cappon before the 49ers ended the first quarter up 4-2. Both teams scored five goals apiece in the second quarter as the Gauchos benefited from goals by junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, junior two-meter Liam Gaughan and two from Snyder.</p>\n<p>Going into the second half both teams looked to continue playing physically in the close contest. It ended up being a half of missed opportunities for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The first big play of the second half was a penalty shot opportunity for the Gauchos. Snyder stepped up in the one-on-one opportunity against Long Beach St.’s junior goalie Pavo Ljepopio, and ripped a shot that hit the post.</p>\n<p>Later in the quarter the Gauchos wasted a six-on-three opportunity with a shot over the goal and continued to miss chances to put more points on the board. UCSB hit the post back-to-back in one possession, and freshman attacker Shane Hauschild was stopped on a breakaway opportunity before he was able to take a shot.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we did miss two penalties and didn’t capitalize on a six-on-three opportunity,” Wigo said. “Those were critical moments.”</p>\n<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the game was still a close contest with Long Beach St. leading 12-9. After the 49ers got an early goal in the quarter, the Gauchos pulled a goal back as Hauschild converted a penalty shot opportunity. Long Beach St. then countered with a goal of its own before Hauschild had another penalty shot. This time Ljepopio made the save, conserving his team’s four-goal lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos pushed back as they scored two goals from Cappon and senior utility Brendan McElroy to cut the deficit to two with 1:23 to go. After a couple of missed shots, the game came to a close with the score 14-12.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look towards this weekend when they face top competition at the So Cal Tournament at UCLA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/","id":525,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[524,523,522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Santa Barbara Readies for MPSF Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"MPSF season begins for No. 5 UCSB with games against ranked opponents ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s water polo team travels to No. 4 USC on Saturday and hosts No. 6 Long Beach State on Sunday in its first two conference games of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will enter the weekend 8-2 following a fifth-place finish in the Nor Cal Tournament two weekends ago.

We want to decrease shots in set and force the team to play in the power play instead. On offense we want to get spread out and get the ball to the strong side in order to get the ball into set to our big guys, [junior two-meter Nick Jordan] and [junior two-meter Samer Alkateb].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be without one of its key players, junior attacker Matt Hamilton. Hamilton sustained a concussion in the match against Long Beach State two weeks ago and hasn’t been able to practice since. It is unknown when he will be able to return to the water.</p>\n<p>“Hamilton is one of our leaders. He’s a defensive player we depend on,” Racich said. “We will need guys to step up in our second lineup and put in a strong defensive team effort.”</p>\n<p>USC will host the Gauchos on Saturday coming off a 21-5 victory over No. 12 Pepperdine in its first conference match of the season. Freshman utility Bryce Hoerman banged in four goals, a career high, while freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards potted three goals. In total, 10 Trojans scored to lead a well-balanced attack.</p>\n<p>“Last time we played USC we were down 6-5 in the third-quarter and let the game slip away. We have the ability to keep up with them, if not the ability to win,” Racich said. “Last time out we let their players fake ball a lot, and we need to minimize our errors. Our defense made too many mistakes and one thing we will make sure to do is to get out to their shooters faster.”</p>\n<p>The Trojans hold an 11-2 record overall coming into their match with UCSB this weekend. Top performers for the Trojans include senior driver Kostas Genidounias, freshman driver Matteo Morelli and freshman driver Grant Stein. The team finished fourth in the Nor Cal Tournament after a loss to No. 3 California in the third-place match after a loss to No. 1 UCLA.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will host Long Beach St. in its first home game after the start of the new school year. Long Beach St. is 9-2 with its only previous losses coming at the hands of UCSB and California in the Nor Cal Tournament. The 49ers are led by a strong group of juniors including center Ricardo Guimares, defender Zacchary Kappos and utility Dimitrios Lappas.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played, the Gauchos won 14-13 in sudden death in a very physical match in which Hamilton suffered his injury.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach plays a very physical game,” Racich said. “There will definitely be a lot of energy and it’s gonna be a physical fight. We want to win this one for Matt.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to see freshman attacker Josh Jordan and junior attacker Bryan Snyder step up in Hamilton’s absence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play USC at noon on Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center and host Long Beach State at noon on Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>This story is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/","id":5069,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5068,5067,5066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Home-Opener Over No. 9 UCSD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's water polo team improves to 5-1 with a win over the Tritons.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"56137\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/vizilabda/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,206\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Getty Images\\/Hemera\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"pool\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"99026342\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"vizilabda\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;pool&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-56137 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda-260x206.jpg?resize=260%2C206\" alt=\"waterpolo ball\" width=\"260\" height=\"206\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">​</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s water polo team defeated the No. 9 UCSD Tritons on Saturday, 13-10, to bring its record to 5-1.

We knew they were gonna be tough,” Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We did what we had to. We maintained a somewhat comfortable lead and we didn’t let them come back all the way to tie it. If they had, then it could have got dicey. It was a great team effort.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos took a 6-3 lead after a goal from junior attacker Ryan Baliani, two from freshman attacker Josh Jordan, one from junior attacker Matthew Hamilton, and two from freshman attacker Shane Hauschild. The Tritons battled back to score two goals in order to enter half time only down by one.</p>\n<p>​UCSB made it a point to work hard against UCSD’s star player senior utility Josh Stiling. With a strong defensive presence, the Gauchos kept Stiling to three goals while making the Tritons focus their attacking plans through other players. With his goals, Stiling was able to keep the score close however.</p>\n<p>​After UCSD’s senior utility Luca De Vivo tied the game at 6-6, the Gauchos went on a run of their own. Baliani, Hamilton, and junior attacker Kevin Cappon scored to give the Gauchos a three-goal lead. From there, the Tritons never caught up as UCSB entered the fourth quarter up 9-7 and added to the lead to make the score 11-7 with goals from junior two-meter Nicholas Jordan and Baliani, his third of the match to give him a hat-trick.</p>\n<p>​A second goal from Cappon extended the Gauchos’ lead before the Tritons scored three goals to trim the lead to two. Junior utility Chase Racich sealed the game for UCSB with a goal with 13 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>​“It was a great first game back for us. Huge fan support, school’s not even in session yet and our stands were full. A lot of energy… It was our first home game and a fun way to start the season,” Hamilton said. “Legs [Whitelegge] is the rock of our defense. It’s really easy to play water polo when you have him playing behind you. We just try to make it as easy on him as possible. We just try to do our jobs and let him take care of the rest.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos will now look towards the Nor Cal Tournament and their matchup with LMU this upcoming weekend before going to USC to take on the Trojans on Oct. 4.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/","id":5068,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5067,5066,5065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Freshmen Ready to Build Upon UCSB’s Strong Finish to Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-02.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-02.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are set to bring in a much smaller recruiting class than they have in previous years, but  they hope that the incoming freshmen can make just as much an impact as they have in the past.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The season didn’t go quite as the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team hoped it would as it missed out on the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished their season with a win in their last game over No. 18 UC Davis, earning them a fifth-place finish in the Big West Championships.

Delgado was a key player on her club team Xtreme, also known as the CBU Lancers, where she was a constant goal-scoring threat.</p>\n<p>“Madison [is] a strong club player with a ton of experience,” Wigo said. “[She and Hendrix] are both attackers.”</p>\n<p>Another one of the recruits that have been named thus far is Tina Samson, another northern Californian product.</p>\n<p>“[Tina] is a crafty player, a great shooter and a hard worker,” Wigo said. “She can definitely help us out as well.”</p>\n<p>With such a young squad, UCSB knows that it is going to have a number of options in terms of its rotations in the pool for the next several years.</p>\n<p>However, the team can still only have seven players in the water at a time, so the new players will have to work hard in order to earn their playing time.</p>\n<p>Choosing who gets to play and who doesn’t is going to be a difficult choice to make, but in the end, Wigo believes that this can only help the team improve.</p>\n<p>“It’s a young team and there’s going to be a lot of fighting and competition for the playing spots, but that’s a good thing,” Wigo said. “They can all potentially play. Everyone has been good teammates and it’s been a fun, competitive year, and we’ll look for that to continue next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 15, 2014 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/","id":5067,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5066,5065,5064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Stays Local With Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WaterPoloEricSwenson.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WaterPoloEricSwenson.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Shane Hauschild headlines the UCSB men's water polo recruiting class for the 2014 season.

Hauschild is known for his athletic achievements in both water polo and volleyball.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent, Hauschild mentioned that he might attempt to play both water polo and volleyball for the Gauchos. With a scholarship under his belt, water polo is the main focus for now. Standing tall, Hauschild’s long reach and powerful shot will be a strong addition to UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>Another local joining the team is Matt Jarvis from Ventura. Jarvis will play center for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He is a really strong and physical player as well,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>The last confirmed incoming freshman for the Gaucho squad is Josh Jordan from Sacramento. Jordan is the younger brother of junior utility Nick Jordan.</p>\n<p>“He is a very versatile player, so he will help us a lot,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also plans to welcome back senior utility Chase Racich, who played on the team his freshman year in 2011.</p>\n<p>Other than losing assistant coach John Abdou to USA Water Polo, the Gauchos 2014 season is looking to be similar to the last. Finishing last season 17-11 overall, UCSB looks to make progress from last year’s growth and improve on its seventh-place finish in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We really are going to be a deeper team,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-stays-local-with-recruits/","id":5066,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5065,5064,5063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Season With Overtime Victory Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloKennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloKennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated UC Davis in overtime for fifth place in the  Big West Championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The season has officially come to an end for the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team.

We each made mistakes but we were also able to make some great things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle in which neither team was able to pull away, the two sides found themselves deadlocked heading into overtime.</p>\n<p>“We played hard and smart the entire game,” Porter said. “After the buzzer sounded at the end of the fourth, we came into the wall and all agreed we weren’t going to end the season with a loss.”</p>\n<p>The game remained extremely tight until the very end, but UCSB eventually got the win that it wanted, holding on for an 11-10 victory.</p>\n<p>“We were able to pull away with a win because we came together as a team,” Porter said. “We refused to give up, and fortunately for us our offense and defense worked really well together in overtime.”</p>\n<p>Two days earlier, the Gauchos came into their first game of the weekend against Long Beach looking to avenge a 9-5 loss earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“Going into the game we were very excited to play them again,” Porter said. “[They] came into the game knowing we were going to give them a fight.”</p>\n<p>Things looked good early on with sophomore utility Samantha Murphy taking advantage of a 6-on-5 to give UCSB a 1-0 lead. However, quick goals from senior defender Coriann Snyder and senior attacker Chelsea Parks gave the 49ers a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader gave the Gauchos their second goal of the day on another 6-on-5 situation to tie it at two goals apiece, but Long Beach quickly took the lead again and did not relinquish it for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>A second straight four-goal quarter sent the 49ers to halftime with an 8-4 advantage with Parks and junior attacker Justine Morgan leading the way. Parks eventually finished the day with four goals and Morgan contributed a hat trick of her own.</p>\n<p>As UCSB headed into the second half needing something to change, it looked to its defense to spark some momentum. However, the part of the Gauchos’ game that had been its biggest strength down the final stretch of the season became a problem when they needed it most.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest weakness was our defense,” Porter said. “We tried to switch it up in the second half to something we barely practice.

All the teams are really close and any team can win any game in my opinion. We’re going to have to play our best and hopefully we do.”</p>\n<p>After a 1-5 start to the season, the Gauchos have battled hard all year to their current record of 11-14 overall and 2-3 in the Big West, despite playing a majority of their games against some of the nation’s top teams. They enter the Big West Championships as the No. 5 seed.</p>\n<p>Long Beach, which enters as the No. 4 seed in the tournament, boasts a record of 18-10 overall and 2-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Last time we played them we didn’t do so well, but we’re going to go forward from that and learn from our mistakes,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “We plan to watch game film and really focus on their defense and plays that they run, so we don’t have a repeat of what happened [last time].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rely on a defense grounded in team communication which has improved tremendously since the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>Anchoring that defense will be two goalkeepers in sophomore Mackenzie Brokaw and freshman Nikki Quinn, both of whom have shared playing time over the last three games.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played great defense in the second half of the season,” Wigo said. “[Long Beach is] a team we definitely can beat.”</p>\n<p>While the defense should prove to be a reliable weapon once more, UCSB knows it still has to score goals in order to win.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we’re on point with our shots because when we played them the other weekend we weren’t on key with our shooting,” Martin said. “We have to come out fired up and ready to play from the beginning. We’ll work on our 6-on-5 in practice and if we do that and execute what we’ve been working on, then I think we’ll be good to go.”</p>\n<p>The last time the 49ers played UCSB, they took control of the game by looking to their two top goal-scoring seniors, attacker Chelsea Parks and defender Coriann Snyder, each of whom put in two and three goals in the 9-5 win, respectively.</p>\n<p>Parks finished the regular season with the fourth highest goal-scoring tally in the Big West at 1.70 per game and 47 total. Snyder, despite being considered a defender, still managed to finish eighth in goals at 1.59 per game and 48 total.</p>\n<p>If UCSB can pull off the win against Long Beach State, it will likely take on No. 6 UC Irvine on Saturday with a chance to play in the Big West first-place game. A loss to the 49ers will result in a Sunday game for fifth place.</p>\n<p>The game is to begin at 1:30 p.m. this Friday in Long Beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 24th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/ucsb-fights-for-its-season-at-big-west-championships/","id":5065,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5064,5063,5062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Fighter of a Freshman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/water-polo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/water-polo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Freshman Goalkeeper Nikki Quinn Has Anchored the Gaucho Defense Despite a Broken Arm","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering college as a freshman can be one of the most exciting and terrifying things in a young person’s life.

For weeks I would go to practice, and I wasn’t allowed to touch a ball so I would just swim and do legs,” Quinn said. “I was just sitting there wanting to play, and in that month it made me realize how much I missed it.”</p>\n<p>The timing of her injury was made even worse due to the fact that Cathy Neushul, the coach who had recruited Quinn to UCSB, was replaced by current head coach Wolf Wigo in the offseason.</p>\n<p>“She mentioned to me in the beginning of summer that I would be the starting goalie, so that was a bummer,” Quinn said. “But I liked getting a new coach because it was a clean slate.”</p>\n<p>Quinn would have to wait to be able to prove herself though, as she worked herself back into game shape as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>She found inspiration wherever she could, whether it was from people telling her that she would never come back from the injury or from a famous athlete like recently-injured basketball star Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>As Quinn fought her way back from the injury, her work ethic and dedication to the team did not go unnoticed by her teammates. On a team full of young freshmen and sophomores, she found a way to stand out and make her presence felt despite being sidelined.</p>\n<p>“Nikki’s the type of person that goes above and beyond everything that she does,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “She didn’t want to miss anything; she wanted to still be involved in what the team was doing. She wants to get in with the team and do the extra amount of work even though she has a cast on.”</p>\n<p>After being sidelined for nearly four months and not playing in a competitive game since August, Quinn finally got her chance to play less than two weeks ago against the top team in the Big West: No. 5 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“The day before the game [Coach Wigo] asked me if I was ready to play, and I looked at him like ‘I’ve been ready. I want to play,’” Quinn said. “Mentally I was thinking, ‘I haven’t played in seven months, do I even know how to play?’ I was nervous, but after the first quarter I got back into the hang of it and it was fine.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for her to face her first test in a college game as the Anteaters found an opening early in the first quarter. However, what seemed to be an easy scoring opportunity from five meters turned out to be a remarkable first career save for Quinn.</p>\n<p>“In my mind that moment was a turning point, because a five-meter [shot] is an easy shot that should be made,” Martin said. “I can only imagine that it just boosts her confidence that much more. I think I speak for the whole team when I say that everyone was just really proud of her for holding her ground and doing what she needed to do.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the game, Quinn tallied a total of six saves and held Irvine, one of the most powerful offenses in the nation, to just six goals. Not too shabby for a freshman playing her first career game.</p>\n<p>“It definitely made me hopeful. I saw things in that game that I could’ve fixed,” Quinn said about her performance. “I think that’s what makes you a better player: when you think of all the mistakes you’ve done and how to fix them for the next game.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for Quinn to get her next chance to shine, as she was chosen to play the second half against No. 9 Cal State Northridge less than a week later. After finding herself in a tightly contested match that was clearly going down to the wire, Quinn stepped up in a big way.</p>\n<p>UCSB led by just one goal after sophomore utility Jessie Porter scored with under five minutes to go, and from then on the Matadors went into desperation mode looking for an equalizing goal.</p>\n<p>With just under a minute remaining, Quinn made an outstanding two-handed save right in front of a goal after a Northridge attacker fought herself free from a UCSB defender. The game wasn’t over yet though, and the Matadors were able to put together one more attack.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an untimely exclusion, the Gauchos found themselves playing 5-on-6 in the most crucial possession of the game, but Quinn came to the rescue once more.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining in the game, a Northridge attacker found herself wide open right in the middle of the UCSB defense. Her shot attempt to tie the game should have gone in easily, but Quinn made a one-handed save that was even more amazing than her previous one, preserving the win for Santa Barbara and making her unbeaten in her only two appearances.</p>\n<p>Despite her individual excellence, Quinn made it clear that she didn’t just have her own performance on her mind.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple minutes, you’re playing for your team,” Quinn said. “If you don’t block [those shots] then you’re letting them down.”</p>\n<p>While clutch plays are not expected to come from young players in their first games, Quinn’s mindset might be the most important reason why she’s been able to play so well under pressure in her few appearances thus far.</p>\n<p>“When the coach asks you which half you want to play, it’s like, ‘Do I want to set the tone in the first half or do I want to be in that situation where we’re down by one and need a stop?’” Quinn said, having personally asked to play in the second half rather than the first. “I like being the last one in the water.”</p>\n<p>Now, with the Big West Championships just a few days away, Quinn will have the opportunity to help her team win in its most important games of the season. Just as she has been all year though, she’s ready for the challenge, and her teammates are more than confident in her abilities to help them win.</p>\n<p>“If [Coach Wigo] picks Nikki then we all have the confidence in her,” Martin said. “You can see it in her eyes; she wants to win.”</p>\n<p>When Quinn hops in the pool this weekend, it’s going to be a tough test no matter who she’s facing. For her though, this entire year has been as tough a test as she has faced since she started playing water polo at the age of 11.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how it turns out this weekend, one thing is for sure: UCSB will have a bright future with Quinn in the cage for the next three years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Nikki Quinn.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/one-fighter-of-a-freshman/","id":5083,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5082,5081,5080],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast CSUN in Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB secured the fifth seed in next week's conference tournament with a victory over Northridge this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final game of the regular season, the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team took down No. 9 Cal State Northridge in a tightly contested match that went down to the wire.

Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader held the ball up high on the right side and picked out her spot before firing one past the keeper to cut the deficit to one. Freshman attacker Brenna Thomas followed that up on the next possession with a deep shot from the left side to tie the game at 4-4.</p>\n<p>“When you get down by one or two goals you really have to shift gears and just fight from that point on,” Quinn said. “We did a really good job at going out there, controlling the game and staying up by one the entire time.”</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, junior utility Lauren Martin took advantage of Northridge on the inside with two strong goals in front of the net. Another goal from freshman attacker Carly Christian gave UCSB three for the quarter, but CSUN had an answer every time.</p>\n<p>“We made a couple of small adjustments, but that was just sort of how the game was going,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “There wasn’t necessarily one turning point in the game; we clawed back, got a couple goals, played solid defense and held on from there.”</p>\n<p>The biggest adjustment for the Gauchos came in the form of Quinn, who subbed in for the second half. The freshman had played in one game all year before this one, but she made her presence felt in the final period.</p>\n<p>Northridge senior attacker Lindsy Duncan scored on a deep lob shot to tie it once again at 7-7 with fewer than six minutes to go, subsequently setting up a thrilling finish.</p>\n<p>With 4:30 left in the game, the Gauchos took advantage of a 6-on-5 situation with Porter just getting a shot to go despite the keeper getting a hand to it, giving them the lead once again.</p>\n<p>From this point on, every desperate attempt to tie the game was smothered by the UCSB defense and Quinn, who had three big saves late, including an outstanding point-blank stop with just 50 seconds remaining. Northridge was unable to find a shot in the final minute as the Gauchos held on for the win.</p>\n<p>No. 5 seed UCSB will play No. 4 seed Long Beach State this Friday at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/","id":5100,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5099,5098,5097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 15 UCSB Hosts Veteran No. 9 Northridge Squad","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB will host second-place No. 9 Cal State Northridge in the team's final regular season match of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team will have nothing more than a final tune-up game before the Big West tournament starts when it hosts No. 9 Cal State Northridge this Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still searching for their first win of the month after dropping three straight close games to Big West opponents.

[Northridge is] kind of a mystery to us right now, so we’re basically focusing on the fact that if we play our game the best that we can then everything’s going to be okay.”</p>\n<p>Defense is going to be the key for UCSB as it has to take on the conference’s top scorer in junior center Marisa Young. In just 29 games, Young has put up an astounding mark of 60 goals. No other player has hit even the 50-goal mark in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“We’re really focusing on fine-tuning what we need to work on,” Hudson said. “We’re focusing on getting our defense really quick and on-point and everyone on the same page. I think it’s going to be a battle of defense this weekend for sure.”</p>\n<p>As they look to end their recent three-game skid, the Gauchos will also have their hands full trying to contain attacker Lindsy Duncan. The senior has accumulated one of the highest goal scoring tallies in the conference with 47 while also leading her team in assists with 43.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played some really strong teams lately and I don’t think we’ve been performing poorly, necessarily. It’s just that we’ve been playing really strong competitors,” sophomore utility Holly Smith said. “We’ve played well, but we just need to take it to the next level in order to beat teams like Northridge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had won five straight games before losing its last three conference games, two of which were at home. However, with those losses coming by an average of less than three goals per game, the Gauchos know that they are on the right track heading towards the season’s finale.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better every single game,” Hudson said. “It’s not reflecting that in our record right now, but we’re also playing much higher ranked teams than in the beginning. If you look at the scores in the games we’ve lost, we’re actually playing teams a lot closer than in the beginning of the year.”</p>\n<p>One of the main issues for Santa Barbara from the beginning of the season was its inexperience due to a large number of freshmen and sophomores. Though talented, it has yet to be seen if that talent can outweigh the experience of some of the other teams in the conference heading into the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s missing right now is that little extra something to win a game when we’re tied or down by one with a minute left,” Hudson said. “Not many of us have that experience at this high level to really put a team away and finish a game strong. I think that’s definitely what we need to work on, and if we can do that then I think that the Big West tournament and the game against Northridge will go really well for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on the Matadors this Friday at 4 p.m. at Campus Pool for their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/","id":5099,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5098,5097,5096],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Third Straight Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=826%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to UC Irvine 6-3 and Long beach State 9-5.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team entered the weekend disappointed about a home loss to No. 9 Hawaii the prior week and failed to redeem itself after falling to UC Irvine in a 6-3 loss on Saturday.

Next time we need to make our goals from the start so we don’t get behind.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was finally able to break the seal on the goal in the fourth quarter when freshman attacker Taylor Shore put in a goal, but the 5-0 deficit through three periods was too big a deficit to come back from.</p>\n<p>Freshman and sophomore attackers Carly Christian and Bryn Hudson also added goals in the final period, but the Gauchos fell short by a final of 6-3.</p>\n<p>Getting the start at goalkeeper for UCSB was freshman Nikki Quinn, who put together a good effort with six saves as she and the rest of the defense held the Anteaters well under their season scoring average.</p>\n<p>“We actually did play well today,” Martin said. “During the first half we were communicating pretty well on defense. We drew a lot of ejections and we were working well as a team, but the shots that we took were not going in. Our offense in our 6-on-5 needs to improve because we made all three goals from a man up.”</p>\n<p>In their road match against Long Beach State on Sunday, the Gauchos came out with a little more offensive firepower, scoring two goals in the first half. However, the 49ers took a 4-2 lead into halftime thanks to a dominant performance by senior defender Coriann Snyder, who ended the game with a hat trick.</p>\n<p>“Today I felt our defense was our strong point even though the score didn’t show that,” Porter said. “What could have been better was our communication on both ends of the pool.”</p>\n<p>The third period saw the least amount of defense from both teams as Long Beach senior attacker Chelsea Parks put in a pair of goals to match UCSB’s two third quarter goals. Trailing 8-4 heading into the final frame, the Gauchos ran out of time on their way to a 9-5 loss.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Samantha Murphy led UCSB with two goals against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>With just one game remaining in the regular season against No. 7 Cal State Northridge, the Gauchos aren’t worried about a 1-3 record in Big West games at this point.</p>\n<p>“We are confident that we will do well,” Martin said. “Everyone for the most part is pretty even.

We are super young and just getting better every single game.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by one goal in the final seconds of regulation, UCSB was denied on two separate point-blank chances by Hawaii’s senior goalie Amy Carlson, preserving the win for the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>“We were very disappointed to lose this game but it showed us exactly what we need to improve on and how we can take on the coming teams,” Smith said. “We are confident going into our next game because each game we’re continuing to improve and working together really well.”</p>\n<p>With just three more conference games remaining this season, the Gauchos will now look forward to a match with No. 6 UC Irvine Anteaters, the team tied atop the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We learned a lot from this loss,” Hudson said. “If we run into Hawaii at [the Big West Championships], it’ll definitely be a different outcome.”</p>\n<p>The match with Irvine will begin at noon this Saturday at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/","id":5095,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5094,5093,5092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes For Six Straight Games Saturday Vs.

We were all really confident so hopefully we will continue to win against Hawaii on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>When Hawaii comes to town, it will bring with it one of the most outstanding offensive duos in the country in sophomore attacker Paula Chillida Esforzado and senior utility Danielle Lewis. Esforzado leads her team both in goals (38) and assists (29) in just 19 games while Lewis has scored 37 goals on a team-high 49.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to play very similar to what we did last weekend,” sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw said. “We’re a super young team and we were kind of scattered at the beginning of the year but now we’re all developing and knowing each other’s strengths so we can work together really well. We’re excited.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense has carried them in the last month. After allowing over 9.1 goals per game through their first 16 games, the Gauchos have decreased that number down to just 4.6 per game in their last five wins.</p>\n<p>“We want to play exactly how we played against Davis. That was our best game by far and if we continue to play like that then we shouldn’t have a problem beating Hawaii,” Smith said. “Each game we play we hit another milestone, and every game we get a little bit better. We’re just continuing to progress and that’s really exciting to be able to watch the team change and see that all the hard work is paying off.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Hawaii this Saturday at noon at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54576\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54576\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/","id":5094,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5093,5092,5091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Finish Tournament With 3-1 Record","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB bounced back from a slow start to the season with a 3-1 record in the Cal Lutheran Tournament this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It has not been an easy start to the season for the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team, but after going 3-1 this past weekend in the Cal Lutheran Tournament, things are looking up.</p>\n<p>After a narrow 11-10 defeat to No. 16 Michigan, the Gauchos won each of their next three games over Fresno Pacific, Chapman and Villanova by double digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely getting better,” sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson said. “Right now our priority is defense.

Michigan went undefeated on the weekend, improving to 7-10 overall. Fresno Pacific went 2-2 and is now 5-10 on the year. Chapman is now 3-3 overall after going 1-2 in the tournament and Villanova finds itself at 3-11 after picking up its first win of the year.</p>\n<p>In their first match on Friday, the Gauchos took on the Wolverines looking to prove that they were a better team than their record might suggest. UCSB has struggled against the nation’s top teams so far this year, but it came out strong in this one with goals from junior utility Lauren Martin and sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson to take a 2-1 lead into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Both teams fired back and forth at each other, answering every run that was made. With the game close in the fourth quarter, goals by Martin, sophomore utility Jessie Porter and freshman attacker Carly Christian helped send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“Lauren did a really good job. She drew a lot of ejections for us and gave us a lot of 6-on-5 opportunities and penalty shots,” Hudson said of her teammate. “We just unfortunately couldn’t really convert, so that’s definitely a jumping off point the next couple weeks. We have a lot of time to work on our 6-on-5s because that’s kind of our weakness.”</p>\n<p>In the extra period, Porter was able to put away one more goal for the Gauchos, her third in the game. However, her team fell just short, giving up two overtime goals on its way to an 11-10 loss.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working on a lot of things that we need to do win games, like not letting other teams score out of two meters,” Hudson said. “We definitely struggled with that, but you live and you learn so hopefully that won’t happen again and we’ll get better.</p>\n<p>Going into its second game of the day against Fresno Pacific, UCSB came out on fire in the first half, scoring six goals in the second quarter to take an 8-1 lead. Thanks to their hot start, the Gauchos cruised to an easy 14-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Both Hudson and sophomore attacker Mackenzie Baber led the way offensively with three goals each while sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had nine saves.</p>\n<p>“We had a rough game against Michigan so I think that kind of sparked a fire under everyone,” Hudson said. “We wanted to prove that we were really better than all the other teams there so that definitely helped as a motivator.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB took on a Chapman team that had gotten off to a hot start to its season after allowing just two goals in its first two games. The Gauchos showed why they have one of the best teams in the nation though, as they completely dominated on their way to a 17-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Martin and freshman attacker Brenna Thomas each put away four goals to lead UCSB to its largest win of the season.</p>\n<p>Playing against a Villanova team off to a miserable start to the year, the Gauchos took advantage of the opportunity to get more of their players involved. Strong defense and a balanced offensive attack allowed UCSB to score a season-high 18 goals while giving up just five.</p>\n<p>No player scored more than two goals in this game and 12 players contributed at least one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have three weeks off before playing their next game at home against Harvard on March 22 at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/","id":5093,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5092,5091,5090],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":13,"route":"/categories/sports/water-polo","highestPage":21}},"__N_SSG":true}
