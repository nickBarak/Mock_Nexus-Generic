The Gauchos will look to continue the strong play versus a struggling Sonoma State side and a fluctuating UC Davis team.</p>\n<p>Sonoma State comes into this matchup with a 6-13 record but has won three of its last five games. UC Davis began the season 1-8 but has improved to 11-13 on the year after a 7-2 stretch in its last nine contests.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Sonoma State have only met once in the last three seasons. This will only be the Seawolves’ second game at home this season.</p>\n<p>Sonoma State has a great three-headed attack who each have over 29 goals this season. However, this season the Seawolves have conceded over 10 goals per game which may not bode well against a young, rising UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>After the game against the Seawolves, the Gauchos will travel to UC Davis to start Big West play against the Aggies on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Last season the Gauchos finished third in the conference with a 3-2 record but went on to claim their first-ever Big West Tournament Championship.</p>\n<p>UCSB faced UCD back in February at the Triton Invitational in a tight match. The Gauchos began to pull away in the fourth quarter, but the Aggies came back and cut the deficit to just one goal with a minute remaining, ultimately losing 8-7.</p>\n<p>That win for Santa Barbara made it six wins in their last eight games against Davis. However, the goal differential in the last eight meetings is just one. With that said, a close game should be expected between these two.</p>\n<p>The Aggies possess two lethal goal scorers in junior utility Paige Virgil and junior center Greta Kohlmoos, who have 46 and 49 goals, respectively. Virgil earned Big West Player of the Week three weeks ago, while Kohlmoos got it two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a lethal goal scorer of their own in senior utility Taylor Shore. The team captain is currently riding a three-game hat trick streak with 35 goals in 19 games this season.</p>\n<p>The Corona native will try to keep the hot streak going into conference action.</p>\n<p>Along with UC Irvine, UCSB boasts the best record in the conference at the moment but will have to beat some tough teams to stay there come the end of April.</p>\n<p>Every team in the Big West is ranked top-20 in the national rankings. Five teams hold spots in the top 15.</p>\n<p>Last season it was Long Beach State who was crowned Big West Regular Season Champions, but this year it looks like anyone has a real shot. Perhaps this will be the year the Gauchos win their first ever regular season title.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play at Sonoma State at 5:00 p.m on Thursday, March 9th at Dr. G. Edward Rudloff Pool. It opens Big West play at UC Davis at 11:00 a.m on Saturday at Hickey Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

The Leopards came into this game with a 2-1 record on the weekend; however, that momentum quickly sank.</p>\n<p>This one was all UCSB from start to finish. The Gauchos scored their most goals in a game this season with 16 while also conceding their fewest amount in a game, giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>30 seconds into the game, the Gauchos already scored with a goal from sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser. Shore added in two more goals after that before freshman attacker Natalie Selin wrapped up the first-quarter with a score, making it 4-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Sarah Snyder began the second-period scoring. 23 seconds later, sophomore attacker Guarina Garcia of La Verne scored its first and what would be its only goal of the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB responded by going on an 11-0 scoring run for the remainder of the game. Snyder and freshman utility Abbey Grosse each scored to close out the first half. The lead for the Gauchos was 7-1 at the break.</p>\n<p>One minute into the third quarter, Shore scored again for her hat trick. Later in the quarter, after Kreiser scored her second of the game, Shore threw in her fourth as the Gauchos led 10-1 with more than a quarter left.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Kate Pipkin and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg rounded out the third quarter scoring for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The final quarter had goals from senior attacker Brenna Thomas, freshman utility Kate Coski, senior utility Jenna Solberg and Rosenberg. The final score was 16-1, marking the Gauchos’ largest margin of victory this season.“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>In its second and final game at the Claremont Convergence, UCSB went up against the host Pomona-Pitzer. These two sides met at the UCSB Winter Invitational when the Gauchos won by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens entered this meeting having won four of their last five games after an eight-game losing streak to start the season.</p>\n<p>After a very quiet first quarter, the Gauchos led 1-0 with a goal from Kreiser. The second quarter was a completely different story, as UCSB went on a goal-scoring tear.</p>\n<p>Six Gaucho goals came in the second period of play while the Sagehens scored two over the eight minutes.</p>\n<p>Solberg and fellow senior, defender Sophie Trabucco each scored within the first two minutes of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer answered with two quick goals of its own as they brought it to a one-goal game.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Coski scored for UCSB, and shortly after Shore extended the lead to 5-2.</p>\n<p>In the final 1:39 of the first half, the Gauchos poured it on with two goals from Solberg and one goal from Snyder to close the half with a commanding 7-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens cut the lead to three with 2:17 left in the third quarter, but the Gauchos ended the quarter with goals from Pipkin and Shore to restore the five-goal advantage at 9-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB conceded two goals and scored none in the final stanza as they clinched another victory.</p>\n<p>On Sunday UCSB played Cal State Bakersfield in its first game at Campus Pool in over a month.</p>\n<p>It was a shaky start for Santa Barbara, going down 1-0 from a nice backhanded finish from CSU Bakersfield. UCSB answered when Shore found Pipkin for the tap-in goal.</p>\n<p>The roadrunners took the lead again after that, but UCSB responded with a goal from Selin off a counter attack to conclude the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter the Gauchos took their first lead of the game with a nifty far-post lob shot from Pipkin.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunners tied it up shortly after off a well-executed power play from an exclusion.</p>\n<p>After that, UCSB turned it on with three unanswered goals in just over a minute of action from Kreiser, Shore and Solberg.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the Gauchos increased the unanswered goal streak to six when Snyder, Thomas and Shore added to the lead to make it 9-3 at the 5:19 mark in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>CSU Bakersfield ended the game on a 5-2 run and UCSB won in its home pool by the score of 11-8.</p>\n<p>Improving the defense was a big initiative coming into this weekend. The Gauchos only allowed five goals per game in the three games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think we did a good job defensively,” Kay said. “It’s important now for us to start taking what we do defensively and fueling it into our offense and remembering to attack as the game goes on.”</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore contributed to another outstanding weekend with not only 10 total goals but also assists and steals.</p>\n<p>“I was super excited going into this weekend to get some solid games in,” Shore said. “As a senior I feel like it’s my duty to step up and take control.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos feel like they took another step forward with Big West play around the corner.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76214\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76214\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/","id":4931,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4930,4929,4928],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Participating in Claremont Convergence Invite, Sat.

Last year, the Leopards finished 18-6, their best record in program history, losing in the final of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>Their great run last year was a big improvement considering they had only won 13 games in the previous two years combined.</p>\n<p>Along with the players, a key to their success came from former Head Coach William Rodriguez. Last season, Rodriguez was named the SCIAC Women’s Water Polo Coach of the Year before stepping down to take a Director of Aquatics job elsewhere.</p>\n<p>One year removed from a fantastic season, the Leopards return almost everyone with only one freshman in the mix.</p>\n<p>La Verne’s roster is comprised of 13 juniors and seniors compared to only six for UCSB. These two teams met last year in the same event when UCSB won 21-6.</p>\n<p>The second opponent for Santa Barbara in the Claremont Convergence will be the host Pomona-Pitzer, who the Gauchos defeated 15-5 earlier in the year at their Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer arrives with only one victory in 10 games. The Sagehens began the season with an eight-game losing streak by an average of almost nine goals per contest.</p>\n<p>Most of the team is back from last year, including a core of four players who were the Sagehens top-four goal scorers. One of those players is junior attacker Morgan McCracken, who was selected as the SCIAC Water Polo Player of the Week after tallying her first multi-goal game of the season last week.</p>\n<p>Looking to turn this season around, the current nucleus of players have experienced some success in recent years with at least 19 wins in four of the last five seasons.</p>\n<p>In their most recent games, Pomona-Pitzer won 17-3 and lost 13-11. They seem to be moving in the right direction heading into this weekend.</p>\n<p>After taking part in the Claremont Convergence, the Gauchos will travel back to UCSB for a home game versus No. 24 Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>The 8-7 roadrunners are 6-2 in their last eight games. Last weekend, they swept their four games at the Cal Lutheran Tina Finali Invitational, winning with nearly a 14-goal average margin of victory.</p>\n<p>However, CSU Bakersfield is 1-6 this year against top-25 ranked opponents, which could be a good sign for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>This will be the first home game for UCSB since their Winter Invitational over a month ago.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play two games in the Pomona-Pitzer Haldeman Pool this Saturday, March 4, when they face La Verne at 2:15 p.m. and the hosts, Pomona-Pitzer, at 7:15 p.m. On Sunday, UCSB will play at home versus Cal State Bakersfield at noon.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/","id":4930,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4929,4928,4927],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Splits Slate of Games at Barbara Kalbus Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite opening the Kalbus Invitational with a loss to Michigan for the third time this season, the UCSB women's water polo team managed to win half of its matchups over the weekend.

With the quarter ending at the same score, this match was looking like another defensive battle as expected.</p>\n<p>UCSB couldn’t get anything going with the attack in this one. The Gauchos were unable to get a goal in the second quarter, while the Wolverines took a solid 3-1 lead heading into the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought it within one 30 seconds into the second half with a goal from sophomore utility Kate Pipkin. However, the goal-scoring woes continued throughout the rest of the second half as Santa Barbara was outscored 2-7.</p>\n<p>The final score was 10-4 in Michigan’s favor, marking their third victory over UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>In its following match the next morning, UCSB faced Cal State Northridge with both squads looking to bounce back after beginning the tournament with tough defeats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a slow start, as the Matadors had a 2-0 lead with 4:27 remaining in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>At the 2:08 mark Santa Barbara was finally on the board after freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored her first goal of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Just 42 seconds into the first half, senior utility Taylor Shore evened the score at 2-2 in what turned out to be a remarkable quarter for the captain.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute went by when Snyder scored to give UCSB its first lead of the contest.</p>\n<p>Shore then stole the show as she netted her second goal of the game at the 4:13 mark and her third goal with 3:32 remaining. Shore’s second-quarter hat trick was the fifth time in 15 games this season that she has scored at least three goals in a game.</p>\n<p>The first half ended 5-4 with CSUN very much alive to take the victory.</p>\n<p>Eight goals were scored between both teams in the third quarter. First it was sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser, then Snyder extended the Gaucho lead to 7-4.</p>\n<p>CSUN answered with two goals of its own as it continued to hang around.</p>\n<p>With a 7-6 lead halfway through the third quarter, UCSB scored three consecutive goals, two from Pipkin and one from Shore. The third quarter ended 10-7 with the Gauchos on top.</p>\n<p>Kreiser scored the only goal for Gauchos in a quiet final stanza, giving them their first win of the tournament by the score of 11-8.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior and recent returnee Miranda Schrader contributed with a team-high four assists. Freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder was also very productive with nine saves.</p>\n<p>A victory meant UCSB was set to face San Jose State to try to continue its winning ways.</p>\n<p>In this tight contest, the first period ended 2-1, advantage Spartans. Senior defender Sophie Trabucco scored the lone goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB put together a strong quarter in the second as it took the lead 3-2 with two goals from senior attacker Brenna Thomas.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth third quarter included two goals from each team. Snyder and Kreiser scored for Santa Barbara to keep the one-goal advantage at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Pipkin threw in her only goal of the game with 5:19 remaining to increase the lead to two goals.</p>\n<p>San JoseState came together for a late surge, scoring two goals in the final 2:12 of the game to send this one into overtime.</p>\n<p>The Spartans opened the scoring, but Kreiser answered 24 seconds later, sending it into a second overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB couldn’t find the net in the second overtime and conceded two goals, resulting in a heartbreaking loss. This is the first loss for the Gauchos against a team ranked behind them in the national rankings.</p>\n<p>Snyder tied her season-high with 15 saves in the cage. Thomas and Kreiser led the team in goals with two apiece.</p>\n<p>After dropping two of their first three games, UCSB was in the 11th-place game against UC San Diego, who also had a record of 1-2 in the tournament.</p>\n<p>At their previous tournament in San Diego, the Gauchos only allowed 6.5 goals per game. Through three games in Irvine, the Gauchos conceded nine goals per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara reverted to their old ways as they stepped it up on the defensive end versus UCSD. Both the defense and the offense had some great moments in this game.</p>\n<p>The first quarter was a Gaucho goal-scoring frenzy. Five goals were poured in by Kreiser, Trabucco, Selin and Pipkin, who had two.</p>\n<p>Seniors Thomas and Shore scored the two second-quarter goals, which brought the score to 7-2 at halftime with UCSB on top.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter Pipkin finished off her hat trick, with UCSB leading 8-5 heading into their final quarter of the tournament. Neither team found a goal in the fourth quarter, which meant UCSB earned 11th place in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational.</p>\n<p>The results were not as hoped, but this young team still had plenty of good moments to take away from the weekend.</p>\n<p>Next weekend UCSB will participate in the Claremont Convergence before beginning Big West conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/","id":4929,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4928,4927,4926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Await Barbara Kalbus Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering the weekend with a current two-game win streak, the UCSB women's water polo team will look to extend its streak over the course of the three-day invitational.

Both games have been low scoring defensive battles as UCSB has only scored six goals in their two games against Michigan.</p>\n<p>After only giving up 6.5 goals per game at the Triton Invitational, the Gauchos look primed for revenge in what should be another defensive clash.</p>\n<p>Michigan come at you in many ways as they have five players who have scored over 17 goals this season. UCSB has two such players and has played one less game than Michigan this year.<br>\nA win against Michigan would mean the Gauchos would automatically finish in the top eight at the UCI Invitational. If they lose to Michigan and win the rest of their games, they would finish in ninth place.</p>\n<p>Depending on the result versus Michigan, UCSB will either play Stanford or Cal State Northridge early on Saturday.</p>\n<p>If they win, they would have a good chance of playing Stanford, the top team in the nation, who is undefeated.</p>\n<p>They have truly been dominant this season, only conceding four goals per game while scoring 16 goals per game. In fact, Stanford has never trailed at any point in any game this season.</p>\n<p>The other matchup possibility would be UCSB versus CSUN. Santa Barbara beat CSUN recently at the Triton Invitational 11-6. The Gauchos controlled that game and were the better side throughout the four quarters of play.</p>\n<p>A successful outcome at the UCI Invitational would launch this young team in the right direction as Big West play approaches. In the meantime, the Gauchos are still trying to get better every day.</p>\n<p>“It’s midseason, so right now we’re just trying to get better at the things we have been working on, and then we’ll add to that come conference time,” Kay said. “Right now it’s still defense, counter attack and just kind of the fundamentals.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior utility Miranda Schrader had surgery over the summer and was selected as one of the UCSB performance lifestyle athletes of the week for her hard work in returning to the pool.</p>\n<p>“[Schrader] is fully cleared to play, so it’ll be nice to have her back in the water and have her fill that southpaw role,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Schrader’s experience and effectiveness will be needed for the Gauchos to make a run in the latter part of this season.</p>\n<p>Another player who is essential to the team’s success is senior utility Taylor Shore, who is putting together another outstanding year leading the team in goals, assists, steals and field blocks this season.</p>\n<p>“Any game, anyone we play, I know she is going to show up and play the same,” Kay said. “That is what we want to call the Gaucho way. It is what we want to be anytime and every time.”</p>\n<p>A player like Shore who can do it all makes it a lot easier on the team as a whole. The 2016 All-Big West honorable mention knows what it takes to be successful late in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the UCI Invitational when they face No. 8 Michigan at 4:15 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25, at Corona Del Mar High School.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-await-barbara-kalbus-invitational/","id":4921,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4920,4919,4918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Water Polo Nearly Completes Sweep at Triton Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was a successful showing for the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team in its first road trip of the season.

Santa Barbara never looked back as it kept the lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Later in the first quarter freshman attacker Natalie Selin doubled the lead for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With over a minute left in the first quarter, the Matadors scored their first goal of the game to make it 2-1 heading into the second quarter of action.</p>\n<p>Two and a half minutes into the second quarter, senior attacker Brenna Thomas brought the lead back to two goals after the Gauchos took advantage of a Matador exclusion.</p>\n<p>Just before the half with only 21 seconds remaining, senior utility Taylor Shore scored her first of four goals in the game. The score was 4-2 at halftime in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to control the game as they outscored CSUN 7-4 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Snyder opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the third quarter followed by goals from Shore and Thomas.</p>\n<p>At the 5:33 mark in the fourth quarter the Matadors fought back to make it 7-5. From that point on, UCSB cemented the victory by going on a 4-1 run to close the game.</p>\n<p>In that run, Shore added two more goals to her total to give her four on the game, Snyder threw in another for her hat trick and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg also scored.</p>\n<p>That win meant UCSB would automatically finish inside the top eight for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The next opponent was No. 6 Michigan, who they faced at the Winter Invitational earlier in the season in a tough defensive battle. The Gauchos were looking for revenge in this one, as they fell 7-4 last time out against the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>The first quarter was one to forget for Santa Barbara as they uncharacteristically found themselves down 4-0.</p>\n<p>“It was too big of a hole that we dug ourselves under,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “In a game like that where the rest of the game each team is only scoring one goal per quarter, you can’t go down by four.”</p>\n<p>Selin managed to slip a goal in right before the halftime buzzer with 23 seconds remaining to give UCSB a 5-1 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Excluding the poor first quarter, the Gauchos were only outscored 3-2 through the final three quarters of the game. With a 7-2 defeat to the Wolverines, UCSB was looking ahead to their next opponent in San Diego State.</p>\n<p>San Diego State was coming off a blowout loss to USC, so they too were looking to bounce back. The winner of this matchup reserved a spot in the fifth-place game later that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 in the middle of the first quarter, Thomas of UCSB scored her third goal of the weekend to begin the scoring for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser and senior utility Jenna Solberg scored, resulting in a close 3-2 advantage at halftime over SDSU.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter the Gauchos poured in three unanswered goals from sophomore utility Kate Pipkin, Kreiser and redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader to give them a 6-3 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Just 20 seconds into the fourth quarter, Kreiser finished off her hat trick to extend the lead. The final period included goals from Pipkin on a penalty and Snyder, giving UCSB the victory 9-6.</p>\n<p>Several hours later, Santa Barbara faced the Aggies of UC Davis in the fifth-place game at the Triton Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB fell behind 2-0 in the first quarter with 2:56 remaining. 30 seconds later, Shore got the Gauchos on the board with her first of three goals in the game.</p>\n<p>UC Davis responded with a goal of their own and closed the half with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos returned the favor in the second frame, battling back to even the score with goals from Pipkin, Shore and freshman utility Abbey Grosse. It was anyone’s game with the score at 4-4 heading into the halftime break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came away from the third quarter with a 6-5 lead as Kreiser and senior defender Sophie Trabucco lifted the Gauchos ahead of the Aggies.</p>\n<p>Shore struck early in the fourth period followed by Kreiser’s goal three minutes later, which increased the count to 8-5 with 4:12 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>At the 1:12 mark, the Aggies began to claw back, reducing the deficit to two goals. With 55 seconds left, UC Davis scored again as the comeback looked more and more possible.</p>\n<p>However, it was not enough. UCSB held on the take fifth place at the Triton Invitational. This result was another step in the right direction for this young Gaucho squad.</p>\n<p>“Things are starting to fall into place,” Kay said. “There were a few moments throughout the weekend that the games could’ve gone either way, and we held on and came out with the win.”</p>\n<p>The defense of UCSB showed up yet again throughout this tournament, holding opponents to just 6.5 goals per game in their three wins and one loss.</p>\n<p>“Before every game … our focus is to come out and defense first,” said Kay. “I think the team really bought into that.”</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder had 42 saves for the tournament, including 27 on Sunday as she continues to anchor the defense for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder is doing a great job in the cage for us,” Kay said. “She’s a freshman and she’s really stepped into that role right away, and I’m proud of where she’s at.”</p>\n<p>As things start clicking as the Gauchos get closer to Big West conference play, every game seems like a positive growing experience for this young team.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the weekend with every game, because we are a young team, was to learn to play with each other a little bit more,” Kay said. “I think that definitely showed throughout the weekend. We’re a different team leaving after the fourth game than before we arrived.”</p>\n<p>After getting this upcoming weekend off, UCSB will head down to Irvine to participate in the UC Irvine Invitational beginning on Feb. 24.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/","id":4927,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4926,4925,4924],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Prepared for Triton Invitational After Week of Rest","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winless through one match on the road thus far, the UCSB women's water polo team will look to change its away game status this weekend at the Triton Invitational.

Entering the Triton Invitational with a 5-3 overall record this season so far, UCSB has only lost to teams that are ranked above them in the national rankings: No. 7 Michigan, No. 2 USC and No. 5 ASU.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, CSUN, after beginning the season 1-6, has strung together three wins in a row as they look to stay in good form. Since 2011, the Matadors have only beaten the Gauchos three times in 12 matchups.</p>\n<p>“They return all of their starters from last year, so they’re a little bit older of a team,” Kay said. “It’s important that we come out and focus on the defensive end to start, and everything from there will come.”</p>\n<p>The stout defense of UCSB will have to deal with CSUN junior attacker Katelyn Fairchild who has scored a team-high 23 goals this season in just 10 games. This is a Gaucho defense that held the Matadors to only four goals in both matchups last season. It will be a clash of youth and experience on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Following their matchup versus CSUN, UCSB will play in a rematch against either the No. 7 Wolverines or No. 23 Marist, who it faced during the Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was defeated by Michigan that weekend 7-4, so there is an opportunity to get even after being handed its first loss of the season by the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>“Excited about the possibility of facing either of those teams again,” Kay said. “We played [Michigan] tough the first time around.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the UCSB roster has been a work in progress this year. However, against great competition, they have been able to put together impressive results.</p>\n<p>“Every game that we play we’re learning something new about ourselves as a team,” Kay said. “The freshmen are getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>With all the freshmen on the team, the more experienced players have an expanded role in guiding the newcomers. Kay recently had an important conversation with seniors Sophie Trabucco and Jenna Solberg about this season and about their important roles.</p>\n<p>“Both [Trabucco and Solberg] have a big defensive presence for our team; they’re both very competitive and tough,” Kay said. “You can’t do it without players like that. It was really special to be able to share publicly how important that sort of player is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to get back in the pool for some more competitive action as they look to continue to improve their chemistry.</p>\n<p>“This weekend, the main objective is to learn how to play together a little bit more and start putting the pieces together,” Kay said. “It’ll be fun once we get a few more games under our belts and things will start clicking.”</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara finished in eighth place at the Triton Invitational out of 16 teams. This confident bunch is ready to improve upon that result in this year’s event with the help of the young, great freshmen and the reliable seniors.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Cal State Northridge Saturday at 12:30 p.m. in their first match at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/","id":4926,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4925,4924,4923],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Wagner, Fall to Arizona State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its first road trip of the season, the UCSB women's water polo split its pair of matchup at the ASU Invitational.

The Gauchos matched their season high for goals in a quarter with six as they outscored the Seahawks 6-3 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Over a minute into the second quarter, senior utility Taylor Shore threw in her first goal of the day to bring the Gauchos within one. Watson responded by netting her hat trick to bring the lead back to two goals for Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then went on a 3-0 scoring run to take their first lead of the afternoon at 5-4. Redshirt freshman attacker Shannon Moran began the scoring run followed by goals from Shore and freshman utility Sarah Snyder who continued her tremendous goal scoring run.</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the game with four goals which adds to her team high total of 15 goals on the season. The freshman also contributed with two assists this game and is the only gaucho to score in every game up to this point.</p>\n<p>Wagner added two more goals to their total as they took the lead once again, but UCSB returned the favor with two goals scored by Snyder and freshman attacker Natalie Selin ending the half on top 7-6.</p>\n<p>“Wagner came out battling and I give them a lot of credit,” UCSB Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They never backed down the whole game.”</p>\n<p>It took over half of the third quarter to get the first goal of the half. After that Seahawks equalizer, the Gauchos finished the quarter off with two goals in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended their unanswered goal scoring streak to four when they scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter. At this point the Gauchos had a cushioned 11-7 advantage with just 5:35 to go.</p>\n<p>After conceding three straight goals, including two over the final 1:29, the Gauchos held on for what turned out to be a nail-biting victory in the end.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a little out of control on our defensive end and even offensively just taking care of the ball,” Kay said. “We found a way to win, we found a way to hold on.”</p>\n<p>Aside from some mistakes in this game, the defense was solid yet again just like it has been all year for the Gauchos. They have only allowed over eight goals in two games this season. If you exclude the blowout loss to USC, the Gauchos have only conceded about 6.7 goal per game.</p>\n<p>The freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who had nine saves versus Wagner, has been a big part of the defensive success.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder holds down the cage for us and she has a high game IQ,” Kay said. “She has not only a physical presence but also a presence vocally in the cage and I think that makes a big difference for us.”</p>\n<p>Next up were the hosts Arizona State who came into the meeting with a 2-0 record having won their first two games of the Invitational.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils began the scoring at the 5:02 mark in the first quarter. In the ensuing possession, Shore assisted Selin for her second goal of the weekend to even the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the second period, freshman utility Kate Coski chalked up her fourth score of the season. At 2-1 this turned out to be the first and only lead for the Gauchos in this one.</p>\n<p>The hosts levelled 15 seconds later and then took the lead with under two minutes remaining in the half.</p>\n<p>As the half was winding down, Trabucco equalized with her first of two goals in the game. The half came to an end all even at 3-3 in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\n<p>“I was happy about the way that we competed right from the start,” Kay said. “Anytime you you’re playing a team 1-1 in the first quarter and then 3-3 at half that says that you’re playing solid defense and both teams are battling.”</p>\n<p>ASU turned it on the third quarter with four goals while not conceding any at the other end of the pool. UCSB was even with Arizona State in every quarter except the third which ended up costing them the game.</p>\n<p>“We made some poor choices offensively that led to goals for them that set up their offense,” Kay said. “We’re young and the season is early so it’s important at this point that we learn from that third quarter. I think it’s important when things get a little out of our control that we learn to be resilient.”</p>\n<p>The final score was 8-4 as ASU finished off their undefeated weekend. Santa Barbara ended the invitational splitting their two games in Tempe.</p>\n<p>Kay was very pleased with what this young team was able to do on their first road trip against a couple of strong sides. However, with the youth comes some natural obstacles to get around.</p>\n<p>“We need to focus on the details,” Kay said. “We need to realize that it’s the little things that make big things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a short break, UCSB will continue their season at the Triton Invitational in San Diego on February 11<sup>th</sup>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Ariz. to participate in the Arizona State Invitational against two top-25 nationally ranked teams for its first road test of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face No. 21 Wagner and the invite’s host in No. 5 Arizona State this weekend. Both opponents will be playing in season-opening matches, and the Gauchos can only hope their heavy slate to begin the year will be to their advantage despite a short time span for recovery.</p>\n<p>“I knew that six games in three days were a lot to ask for the team to compete at such a high level at the very beginning of the season. It was intended to be that way,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday will commence the Arizona State Invitational for UCSB when it faces Wagner. Notably, both programs have been on an upward trend in recent years.</p>\n<p>However, just like UCSB, Wagner lost some key players who contributed to all of its winnings in recent years. Three of their top five goal scorers in program history graduated last spring. That record-setting core of players led the team to three straight MAAC Tournament Championships.</p>\n<p>Even with the departure of several players, the Seahawks are still not as young as the Gauchos, who consist of eight freshmen and one transfer.</p>\n<p>“Fifty percent of our team is new, but it’s the beginning of the season,” Kay said. “The positive thing is that I think we will be competitive against anybody, so I’m excited about that.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are still trying to find the right mixture of players and play styles. However, UCSB has a slight edge with the momentum it gained from its four victories.</p>\n<p>Wagner is led by three juniors — attacker Elise Begg, utility Kimberly Watson and attacker Lacey Anderson — who all contributed over 55 goals a season ago, ranking them just behind the former three-headed scoring core of seniors who shattered various records.</p>\n<p>Wagner and UCSB have only faced off twice in the past; both meetings were in the last two years. The Gauchos won both games by the scores of 10-6 and 5-3.</p>\n<p>Sunday will provide a tougher matchup versus Arizona State. Scoring against the Sun Devils’ defense will be no easy task as the unit is led by star redshirt junior Mia Rycraw inside the goal cage.</p>\n<p>Rycraw finished last season as a Second-Team All-American goalie with 318 saves, which was first in the conference and third in Arizona State single-season history.</p>\n<p>She is joined by a terrific sophomore attacker from Assendelft, Netherlands, Maud Koopman. Koopman led the Sun Devils in points last season as a freshman with 35 goals.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils have been living in the shadows of MPSF powerhouses USC, Stanford, and UCLA, who routinely compete for National Championships. The current polls have Arizona State only behind Cal, UCLA, USC and Stanford, who are all in the MPSF conference.</p>\n<p>Arizona State finished the 2016 season with a 10-1 home record. UCSB was just 1-4 on the road last year.</p>\n<p>ASU has beaten UCSB once in each of the last five seasons by an average margin of victory of nearly four goals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will once again see where they’re at after the two games this weekend. For now, this team is still trying to figure some things out.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played anybody else besides ourselves before [last] weekend,” Kay said. “Playing other teams really shows what we need to work on and also what we’re good at. I’m looking forward to getting back to work this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Wagner at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 and Arizona State at 1 p.m. the following day, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/","id":4924,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4923,4922,4921],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Winter Invite 4-2, Fall to Juggernauts No. 2 USC & No. 8 Michigan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opening this season at home at Campus Pool hosting the UCSB Winter Invitational, the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team concluded the weekend with a solid first impression despite two losses.

The first half ended with UCSB on top 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put on a beautiful display of attacking in the third quarter. They outscored Cal Baptist 6-2 in the period to give them what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist exploded with three goals in the first three minutes of the final quarter. However, freshman utility Sarah Snyder responded by netting her third and fourth goals of the game for the Gauchos. UCSB earned their first win of the season in their Winter Invitational debut 13-8.</p>\n<p>Later that Friday afternoon, UCSB went up against Indiana in a top-15 battle. UCSB was first on the board thanks to senior captain Taylor Shore. Moments later, Snyder scored her fifth total goal of the day. Indiana returned the favor with two goals of their own to end the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>The second quarter passed in the same fashion as the Gauchos scored the first two goals before the Hoosiers answered with a pair of goals to tie it up.</p>\n<p>That was the last of Indiana’s scoring for the game, because UCSB didn’t concede a goal for the entire second half. Sophomore utility and former Hoosier Kate Pipkin scored two goals in the second half against her former team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with an 8-4 victory, looking confident for the games ahead.</p>\n<p>Day two of the Winter Invitational brought better weather and provided a tougher opponent in No. 8 Michigan. This was a defensive battle from the start. The first quarter came to a close with the score of 1-1 in an even matchup.</p>\n<p>The second quarter began with a quick goal from the Gauchos when freshman utility Abbey Grosse gave a nifty lob pass over the defender to Taylor Shore, who slotted it home for the goal.</p>\n<p>With about two minutes left in the half, the Wolverines scored to even it up at 2-2. The Gauchos went on to earn a power play with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half as head coach Serela Kay called a timeout. The ensuing play led to Shore finding the prolific Snyder for the goal to take the lead at 3-2.</p>\n<p>Michigan quickly responded with a lob shot attempt that landed on the line of the goal as the buzzer sounded, resulting in a no goal call from the referees.</p>\n<p>Michigan threw in three goals in the third as they began to pull away. UCSB found themselves down 4-5 heading into the final period.</p>\n<p>The Wolverine defense stepped up in the fourth period, making it difficult for the Gaucho attack time and time again. UCSB was unable to score in the quarter and was defeated 4-7.</p>\n<p>“The Michigan game really sticks out in my mind because we controlled the game all the way until the fourth quarter,” said Kay. “We’re young, so the fourth quarter moments and game situation moments are really important for us.”</p>\n<p>About an hour later, UCSB had to jump back in the pool for another game as they faced off against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The Gauchos dominated from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored a first quarter hat-trick as the Gauchos led 5-1 at the end of the opening quarter.</p>\n<p>Early in the third quarter, Shore earned another hat-trick as UCSB went up 9-3. Pomona-Pitzer added a couple more goals to their tally, but UCSB eventually earned their third win of the weekend by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The final day of the Winter Invite was layered with heavy rain and constant winds when UCSB squared off versus Marist, which scored double digit goals in its first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stayed with their defensive theme in this game, holding the Red Foxes to only two goals in the first half. UCSB’s balanced attack resulted in seven goals to make it 7-2 at the break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to make it difficult for Marist, which could only total five goals in the entire contest. Snyder and Shore stayed on their terrific goal-scoring pace, each scoring in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off the Red Foxes by the score of 11-5 to earn their fourth victory of the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the rain slowly died down, UCSB took the pool against powerhouse No. 2 USC in the final game of the 2017 Winter Invitational. USC came into the game with an average margin of victory of over 11 goals in their previous four games at the Winter Invite.</p>\n<p>The Trojans continued their goal-scoring frenzy, pouring in seven goals in the first period of play. The Gauchos struggled to get anything together as they trailed 2-12 at the half.</p>\n<p>Snyder, Selin, Trabucco and senior attacker Brenna Thomas scored the Gauchos five goals in the game. USC never took its foot off the gas, winning 19-5 to give it an undefeated record for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough loss to close out their host event, the Gauchos felt good about their performances throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with where we’re at,” Kay said. “I’m actually happy that the weather came in and was windy and stormy; I think it gave us something that we’re really not used to so I think it’ll make us stronger in the end.”</p>\n<p>Shore and Snyder led the team in goals with 11 each. The standout freshman Snyder was very productive over the weekend in her first action with the team.</p>\n<p>“She [Snyder] can play on the outside and on the inside,” Kay said. “She was scoring on power plays, on the perimeter and in front of the cage. She’s a scorer. She’s a finisher. She has no fear.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB will make the trip to Tempe, Ariz., home of Arizona State, to take part in the Arizona State Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/","id":4923,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4922,4921,4920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Winter Invitational to Begin New Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 9 ranked UCSB women’s water polo team looks to continue its success of last season as it starts off the 2017 season at the annual UCSB Winter Invitational.

The Gauchos were crowned Big West Tournament Champions for the first time in school history.</p>\n<p>They followed that up with a seventh-place finish in their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>\n<p>Third-year head coach Serela Kay earned the Big West Coach of the Year honors for the historic performance. The Gauchos have seen a steady improvement each year during her tenure, bringing them into the national spotlight in the sport.</p>\n<p>“I think there’s a change in culture and change in mindset where the players and program show that they can beat anybody in the country,” Kay said. “We’re hosting and competing against some of the best in the country so in order to be the best you need to play the best”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to build off the tremendous success from a year ago, but this year the team will look a bit different, as it will be without four of its impact players from last year, all of whom have graduated. Three of its four highest goal scorers are no longer in the picture, making room for the talented core coming up.</p>\n<p>“We did graduate a good nucleus of the team this past year so we have nine new faces on the team,” Kay said. “Six seniors returning from that squad that won the Big West championship.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Taylor Shore should help in that regard after scoring 46 goals last season while also leading the team in both steals and field blocks. She received a Big West honorable mention for her stellar season. She could be in for a breakout year with the extra opportunity available.</p>\n<p>“Looking at Taylor Shore who is our captain,” Kay said. “She’s really crafty and is a really smart player.”</p>\n<p>Shore is joined by returning players like redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader, senior defender Sophie Trabucco, and senior attacker Brenna Thomas. Schrader was second in goals last year among players who are returning this year. Each of them played all 33 games last year and have plenty of experience to carry on the winning mentality in the program.</p>\n<p>The Big West conference is loaded with talent, with every team somewhere in the top-25 national rankings. UCSB is currently the third-highest ranked Big West school behind only UC Irvine and Hawaii. Four of the Big West schools will be participating in the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts No. 22 Cal Baptist this Friday at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool. At 4:40 p.m. the Gauchos will return to Campus Pool to face the Indiana Hoosiers. On Saturday, UCSB will face No. 8 Michigan at 12:30 p.m. and Pomona-Pitzer at 2:50 p.m., both at Campus Pool. On Sunday, UCSB will play Marist at 10:30 a.m. and will close out the Winter Invitational against No. 2 USC at 4:10 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74992\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74992\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/","id":4920,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4919,4918,4917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Poised for Success, On Road for Conf.

USC recently beat UCLA to halt the Bruins’ NCAA-record winning streak and is now the new No. 1 team in the nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_74226\" style=\"width: 493px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74226\" data-attachment-id=\"74226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/gauchos-poised-for-success-on-road-for-conf-tourney/10-15-mwopo-laverne-ericswensonnexus-16-web-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-15-MWopo-LaVerne-EricSwensonNexus-16-web-1.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"10-15-mwopo-laverne-ericswensonnexus-16-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-15-MWopo-LaVerne-EricSwensonNexus-16-web-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-15-MWopo-LaVerne-EricSwensonNexus-16-web-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10-15-MWopo-LaVerne-EricSwensonNexus-16-web-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=483%2C323\" alt=\"Spencer Likins pump fakes before taking a shot on goal.

Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Thanks to their 5-0 conference record, the Gauchos were able to lock up the No. 1 seed in the tournament and will have a bye for the first round. Their most formidable opponent will most likely be No. 5 Pacific, who has the No. 2 seed in the tournament and holds the home field advantage, but they have already beaten the Tigers at their own home 13-9.</p>\n<p>If UCSB ends up playing Pacific, that match won’t happen until the championship round on Sunday. Instead, Santa Barbara will face off against the lowest seed of the Friday match winners on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by many key players such as senior utility Reed Cotterill, who ranks third in the conference in goals with 43. Senior goalkeeper Liam Lenihan has also been great in the cage, posting 154 saves this year — third most in the GCC — and has not allowed double-digit goals in the last seven outings.</p>\n<p>The possible opponents the Gauchos can face in the first round are No. 9 Pepperdine, No. 19 UC Irvine or unranked San Jose State, the only team in this tournament that is not currently ranked in the NCAA national rankings. These three teams are the No. 4, 5 and 6 seed in the competition, respectively.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Pepperdine would be the most likely matchup on Saturday, and, if so, the Gauchos hold the advantage as they have beaten the Waves three times this season, each time scoring at least 10 goals in the game.</p>\n<p>In those three victories, UCSB has outscored its opponent 35-23 and has defeated them once in a neutral site, once on the road and once at home. Just this past Friday, the Gauchos clinched their 5-0 record by defeating Pepperdine 10-8 in front of their home crowd.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest keys for Santa Barbara in that match will be shutting down the offensive powerhouse that is attacker Marko Asic. The 6’1” sophomore currently leads the conference in goals with a whopping 62, 16 more than any other player, and is also second in total points with 71.</p>\n<p>During the match against UCSB last Friday, Asic scored five of the team’s eight goals, including three in the third quarter, to help bring his team back from what could’ve been a blowout.</p>\n<p>If they face UCI, revenge will be on the mind of the Gauchos as last year’s loss in the MPSF tournament is still very fresh and allowed the Anteaters to finish with a higher place at the end of the competition.</p>\n<p>This season UC Irvine has struggled mightily, posting a 9-13 regular season and only a 2-3 GCC record in the inaugural season. If it doesn’t win at least one match this postseason, then it would have its worst winning percentage in a single season since the 2006 campaign when it posted a .35 winning percentage (12-22).</p>\n<p>San Jose State would be the easiest opponent the Gauchos could face, but that doesn’t mean they should underestimate them. The Spartans have the lowest seed because of their winless conference season but has the necessary players to pull off an upset against LBSU in its opening round match.</p>\n<p>SJSU’s best player is actually the brother of Santa Barbara’s own Shane Hauschild. Ben Hauschild has been a great addition for a very young Spartan team, especially on the defensive side. His 49 steals are the most in conference this year, and he has 23 goals and seven assists to go with that.</p>\n<p>No matter whom they face, the Gauchos will be ready. This is the first time in over 20 years they can say they are the favorites, and that excites not just the coaches and players, but fans as well.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its postseason run at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 19 at Pacific’s Chris Kjeldsen Aquatics Complex, against whom to be determined.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

No. 9 [Marko Asic] was great.”</p>\n<p>With the victory on senior night, Santa Barbara finishes the regular season with an 18-6 overall record and a perfect 5-0 conference record, winning its final seven games and securing its No. 1 seed for the inaugural GCC tournament set to begin this Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_74165\" style=\"width: 631px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74165\" data-attachment-id=\"74165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/no-4-ucsb-accomplishes-first-perfect-conference-record-finish-in-37-years/reed-cotterill-puts-up-a-hand-to-block-the-goal-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-11-MensWopo-Pepperdine-SeniorNight-EricSwensonNexus-11-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Reed Cotterill puts up a hand to block the goal.

Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Pepperdine finishes out the year with an even 12-12 record, 2-3 record in conference play — setting them up to be the No. 4 seed in the tournament — and will face off against No. 5 Irvine for a chance to continue moving on in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Early on, the match seemed to be going as expected on paper: Santa Barbara was running away with it. However, thanks to a hearty performance from sophomore Marko Asic, who scored five goals, Pepperdine fought its way back before eventually running out of energy — and time — once the fourth quarter came around.</p>\n<p>In the first half of the match, everything seemed to be going the Gauchos’ way. Senior attacker Mitchell Hamilton and sophomore driver Boris Jovanovic scored two goals apiece before the break, leading to the home team taking a 4-2 lead after two-quarters.</p>\n<p>After an early opening third-quarter goal for UCSB, courtesy of senior attacker Thomas Martinho, fans were frantically cheering on the home team as though the game were over. Even with that, Asic rallied his team back, scoring a goal and then assisting on the next to cut the lead to 5-4 with just over three minutes left in the third.</p>\n<p>As the frame continued, UCSB got a score back to re-take a two-goal lead, but senior attacker Christian Bradley countered, which led to Asic’s third goal of the game, tying the score at six. Both teams traded one more goal — with Asic’s coming as the clock expired with no time left — before the quarter’s end to go into the final frame tied.</p>\n<p>Fans and even the Gauchos looked stunned by the five-goal rally Pepperdine put in the third to get back into the game. However, this night belonged to Santa Barbara, who looked spectacular in the fourth.</p>\n<p>After trading goals, senior utility Reed Cotterill continued to come in clutch for UCSB and put his team ahead 9-8 with only 2:54 left on the clock. About a minute later, junior attacker Shane Hauschild put the nail in the coffin for Pepperdine with his second goal of the quarter with less than a minute left to make the score 10-8.</p>\n<p>“It felt really good. It was great to get that fourth rank last week, and now finishing the regular season perfect in conference is a huge accomplishment,” Hauschild said.</p>\n<p>Despite it being much more difficult than expected, the Gauchos continued to show the resiliency that allowed this team to put up a perfect 5-0 record and jump up to No. 4 in the country, their highest ranking since 1990.</p>\n<p>It was also a big plus that seniors Hamilton, Martinho, Cotterill, Liam Lenihan, Cameron Yates, Samer Alkateb and Tor Jensen all got to enjoy the beauty of one more win at Campus Pool. With that being said, playoffs are here and the Gauchos are certainly the favorite to win the inaugural GCC tournament. Let’s see if they do.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our big players stepped up,” Wigo said. “It was really good to see a lot of the guys on senior night step up, especially Mitch, [to] get some good goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is yet to be determined, but it will be at Pacific for the Golden Coast Conference Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Santa Barbara is on its biggest winning streak of the year, extending it to six while also being winners in nine of its last 10 matches.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB is already guaranteed the top spot in the GCC tournament next week, but a victory against Pepperdine solidifies them as the outright conference winner of the regular season standings, something it doesn’t want to give up so easily, especially on senior night.</p>\n<p>No. 9 Pepperdine comes into Santa Barbara with a 12-11 overall record and a 2-2 record in conference play. Even with a victory, the Waves are already guaranteed a spot in the Golden Coast Tournament.</p>\n<p>“Pepperdine is a really quality team and we know it’s going to be a battle; they are a rival of ours and rivals always give you a challenge,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>Hoping to pull off the upset, however, Pepperdine will need to rely on the defending of star junior goalkeeper Zack Rhodes. In the cage this season, Rhodes has been a beast posting 176 total saves this season, second best in the GCC and ninth best in the entire country.</p>\n<p>Rhodes is one of two goalkeepers, alongside UCSB’s own Liam Lenihan, to win Golden Coast Conference Player of the Week after registering 18 saves in a losing effort against Pacific 9-8. His 7.8 saves per game is ranked fourth best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Pepperdine has some weapons as well, mainly coming in the form of attacker Marko Asic. The sophomore leads the entire conference in goals scored with 57. His 66 points rank first on the team and second in the GCC.</p>\n<p>Two other notable performers are freshman Mate Toth and attacker Mark Urban. Toth is tied for third in the league in goals with 37, while his redshirt junior counterpart is second on the team and third in conference in total points with 60. Junior attacker Kenneth Keller ranks second in the GCC in assists with 29.</p>\n<p>Despite Pepperdine looking like the better team with many players towards the top of the conference leaderboards, it is clear UCSB still holds the advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have won six straight not because they have been playing easy teams, but because players like senior Reed Cotterill have been excellent. The utility is currently fifth in the GCC in goals with 36, and is coming off a solid four-goal performance in the upset win over Pacific.</p>\n<p>Cotterill has been excellent during the whole winning streak, leading the team in scores with 12. Another solid player has been Boris Jovanovic who is right behind Cotterill in goals over the last six games with 10 of his own.</p>\n<p>With it also being senior day on Friday, it will be an emotional day for the six seniors involved, especially Mitchell Hamilton and Lenihan.</p>\n<p>Hamilton has scored 15 goals this season, the most of any senior on the team. Lenihan, on the other hand, has had an excellent campaign.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gaucho cage was led by Chris Whitelegge, one of the best goalies in MPSF history, so Lenihan had big shoes to fill, but it’s sufficient to say he has done so. This year, his 146 saves rank third in the GCC and he has been dominant during the last six games, recording 55 saves and allowing only one team to pass the double-digit mark in scores.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has a chance to do something special on Friday, and it goes beyond winning a conference regular season title; it has to do with going undefeated. The last time UCSB went undefeated in conference was in 1979 — also the last time they won an NCAA title — and it would also be special to do that in its first year in the GCC.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big deal. We haven’t gone undefeated in conference in 37 years,” Wigo said. “This would be a big statement win and its senior day; the guys will be motivated.</p>\n<p>This year, the Gauchos are 7-1 at home with their lone loss coming to the No. 1 team in the country, UCLA. No doubt they will try to preserve that record this Friday.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Pepperdine in a senior day clash at Campus Pool on Friday, Nov. 11 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

As it stands, with four games left in the 2016 campaign, Santa Barbara is on pace to have its best season since 2008 when it went 20-9 on the year. It is also in search of its first conference title in over 20 years.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine drops to 9-10 on the season, 1-2 in Golden Coast play, and falls into a third-place tie in the conference standings with Long Beach State and Pepperdine. The Anteaters have now lost nine of their last 12 matches played against UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Early on in the match, everything seemed to be going UCI’s way as it jumped out to a commanding lead over the No. 5 team in the country. However, putting its effort and resiliency in full display, the Gauchos redeemed themselves with a strong second quarter and finished off the Anteaters in a close fourth period.</p>\n<p>Right out of the gates, UCI scored in its first two possessions courtesy of a pair of attackers in freshman Ian Fleenor and junior Ryan Warde to take a 2-0 lead. Warde would finish with four goals on the evening, his third four-score performance in his last four matches. After a UCSB score, the Anteaters added two more goals to make the score 4-1 after the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite being down early, the Gauchos responded with a six-goal second frame to take a 7-6 lead into the break. Five different Santa Barbara athletes scored one goal apiece, while junior attacker Shane Hauschild added two.</p>\n<p>After scoring a goal in the 4:20 mark of the third quarter — courtesy of senior two-meters Samer Alkateb, his second of the match — it seemed as though UCSB would ride the momentum into an easy victory. Warde and sophomore attacker Jack Trush had other ideas, however, as each would add a score to end the third quarter with both teams deadlocked at eight.</p>\n<p>The final frame consisted of great defense; after both teams gave up early goals making the score 9-9, they locked down hoping that their team could push through the game-winner.</p>\n<p>Continuing his great season and sealing the win for the Gauchos was junior utility Reed Cotterill who nailed a shot with 2:59 left in the game. Despite having four good looks at the net, UCI was unable to put through an equalizer, giving them double-digit losses on the season.</p>\n<p>Victories are hard to come by as the season progresses, and each one is a feat in it and of itself. With the win, Santa Barbara has now set itself up with the opportunity to win the inaugural GCC regular season title. However, the road to the conference title will still be tough as the Gauchos’ next opponent is Pacific, who also boasts a 3-0 Golden Coast record.</p>\n<p>Regardless of that, Santa Barbara can be proud of the fact that it beat such a tough team in an even tougher environment despite the slow start.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at Pacific on Friday, Nov. 4, at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
