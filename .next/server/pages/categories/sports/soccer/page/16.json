Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored twice from the penalty spot, giving him four goals in the last four games, as he led his team to a crucial 2-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“Really the story of tonight is we did enough to win and that’s all there really is to say about it,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said after the game.</p>\n<p>The win ends a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos, keeping them just one point in front of No. 20 Cal Poly for first place in the Big West North Division. UCSB is now 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in conference, while the Aggies, who had gone undefeated in four straight, fall four points out of first at 7-7-2 overall, 3-2-2 Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Playing without junior midfielder Josue Espana, who was suspended after picking up two yellow cards in UCSB’s game last Saturday at Cal Poly, the Gauchos struggled to find a flow on their offensive half.</p>\n<p>“Josue has started and played basically every minute for us and he controls the middle of our field. That made a huge difference,” Vom Steeg said. “Without him in the game, we were lost.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, a pair of crucial mistakes by Davis defenders cost them the game.</p>\n<p>After controlling the game through the first 15 minutes, midfielder Seo-In Kim brought the ball down the right flank before sophomore defender Greg Salazar’s attempted clearance came right back down off Kim’s arm. The junior transfer from Duke quickly recovered the ball before sending in a cross, ironically coming off of Salazar’s arm this time and resulting in a UCSB penalty.</p>\n<p>“There are referees where literally no matter what happens on the field, they’re not going to call it,” Vom Steeg said. “The referee tonight will call PKs. Definitely the arm was stretched, so I thought that first one was a good PK call.”</p>\n<p>It was Feucht who stepped up to take the penalty for the Gauchos, as he did against Cal State Fullerton in UCSB’s last home outing 11 days prior. The German showed great composure from the spot, seeming to hesitate at the last moment before taking the shot. After seeing Davis redshirt junior goalkeeper Armando Quezada go left, Feucht calmly slotted the ball into the right corner, giving the Gauchos an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“The first half we were moving so well. It was just a matter of time,” Kim said. “Fortunately, we got a cross and [Salazar] handballed it, and Kevin of course is going to tuck it away.”</p>\n<p>Following a solid first 20 minutes of play, UCSB was unable to establish any kind of offensive flow for the rest of the first half. As the second half kicked off, momentum quickly turned the Aggies’ way, as they forced turnovers in the Gauchos’ defensive third and came close to scoring on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p>Davis finally found an equalizer in the 74<sup>th</sup> minute off a long throw into the box. A scramble for the ball resulted in a poor defensive clearance from just in front of goal and junior defender Steven Guzman capitalized, lobbing a header over freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg from about eight yards out to tie the game at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“In general, I thought we did decent [defending] the throw in,” Vom Steeg said. “But you put enough bodies inside the six yard box and bounce it around and do it 15 times… I hope everybody knows it’s not really soccer.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ unorthodox attacking methods brought them level with UCSB, but not for long. Just 70 seconds after the equalizer, junior forward Nick DePuy beat his defender in the box before being dragged down by a reckless tackle from senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg, awarding UCSB its second penalty of the night.</p>\n<p>“Nick did a good job of dropping his shoulder and getting in front of [Mohageg],” Vom Steeg said. “As a defender at that point, I’d let him go a little bit, but the minute Nick got in front and the defender now is trying to save the day with a tackle, I would say around the world that one gets called.”</p>\n<p>Once again, it was Feucht stepping up to put the Gauchos up by one, this time firing it into the left corner with no hesitation while Quezada dove to the right post. That would be the high moment of the game for Feucht, who celebrated with a spectacular flip after notching his fourth goal for UCSB in as many games.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos were able to hold on for the 2-1 victory, but they suffered another huge loss before the game was over. With just 4:33 remaining, a free kick that was awarded to Davis was delayed when Feucht kicked the ball away, resulting in his fifth yellow card of the season.</p>\n<p>This means that UCSB will be without its best holding midfielder for an even more crucial matchup with second place Cal Poly this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it feels like a loss is because we did lose [Feucht] tonight on a fifth yellow,” Vom Steeg said. “We seem to make mistakes that really hurt us, and that’s obviously a mistake because there was no point. Now you’ve got two days to redo all your set pieces and your defensive marking because you’ve got to drop a new player in.”</p>\n<p>Already facing the challenges of fatigue, injuries, and a top-20 ranked Cal Poly team that just beat UCSB 3-2 in double overtime last Saturday, Feucht’s suspension could not have come at a worse time.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard for me to walk in and scream, yell and get animated when the reality is the guys are giving you everything they have. At some point you just get tired,” Vom Steeg said. “You’re now deep into the bench. It’s why we carry 28 players and you’ll have to see a bunch of them Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Despite his frustrations after a grueling contest, Vom Steeg was still able to find one silver lining.</p>\n<p>“At least, good news, Josue will be fresh,” he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will be played for the second time in seven days this Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will get their shot at revenge against the Gauchos in both team’s regular season finale at Davis on Halloween.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/","id":1485,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1484,1483,1482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry: Chapter Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The time has arrived!

We just have to fight and find a way to win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both sides are separated by just one point in the standings, with UCSB at 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in Big West coming off a close win over UC Davis yesterday. The Mustangs picked up a big win themselves yesterday over Sac St. to stay just behind Santa Barbara at 9-3-3 overall and 4-1-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>For those who weren’t there last year when the Gauchos hosted the Mustangs in October 2014, the annual Blue-Green matchup drew an audience of 14,345 crazy fans, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history.</p>\n<p>That number could very well go even higher this time around, with both top-20 sides generating a high level of buzz so far this season.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of my recruitment,” sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi said. “I’ve been dreaming about playing in front of [large crowds], especially our fans, who we all know and love. They all pump us up for the game. It’s really, really good playing in front of them.”</p>\n<p>Expectations were high for the Gauchos coming into the year after having finished with a No. 1 seed in each of the past two seasons, and they have not disappointed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Junior Nick DePuy hasn’t been able to stay out of the headlines over the past year, currently leading the nation in game-winning goals with seven and ranking second overall with 12.</p>\n<p>That’s not too bad of a stat line for a player that didn’t even play forward until midway through his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>DePuy isn’t the only Gaucho making noise in the stat department this season. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong has been absolutely crucial for his team, tied for the Big West lead in assists with seven in just his freshman year while picking up a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Despite a perfect 4-0 start to conference play, the Big West has since learned that UCSB is most certainly not unbeatable. A terribly disappointing 5-2 loss at Sac St. last Wednesday ended a five-game winning streak for Santa Barbara just three days before it suffered its second straight loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were not all negative for UCSB, however, as they saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome. After missing nearly eight full games with an ankle sprain, the former Big West Freshman of the Year showed just how important he is by scoring in each of his first two games back.</p>\n<p>“I think the losses affected us in a good way,” sophomore left back Randy Mendoza said. “We were on a high when we were 4-0, and I think it’s making us hungry and realize that nothing is going to be given to us.”</p>\n<p>Defensive issues have become somewhat of a plague for the Gauchos since the beginning of Big West play. Through their first six conference games, they conceded 11 goals, just one less than the conference’s worst defenses over that span.</p>\n<p>Leading the UCSB defense is a player who is no stranger to the Blue-Green rivalry in goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, son of long-time UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>The freshman, who has spent time playing for the US men’s national soccer team (USMNT) U-20 squads, has had a solid year, going 10-4 as a starter and ranking fifth in the conference in goals against average at 1.32.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in the stands for quite a few [UCSB-Cal Poly games] — some wins, some losses,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “It’s a real emotional game.”</p>\n<p>With three games still to play this season, the Mustangs have already surpassed their mark of eight wins in 2014.</p>\n<p>It’s no surprise that Cal Poly has been able to turn things around this year behind first year head coach Steve Sampson, who boasts an incredible resume that few coaches at this level, if any, could rival.</p>\n<p>Sampson has coached at virtually every competitive level, leading Santa Clara to a national championship in 1989, managing the US Men’s National Team in the 1998 World Cup, leading the Costa Rican national team to its highest ever FIFA world ranking of 17 in 2004 and winning both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup in 2004 with the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost just one game out of their last nine, picking up their biggest win of the year just five days ago at home against UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a thrilling first half in which both teams notched two goals, a sold-out crowd of 11,075 was forced to wait until the 104th minute before Cal Poly’s junior defender Kody Wakasa scored his first career goal on a corner kick, sending UCSB to its second straight Big West loss and bringing Cal Poly just one point out of first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to dominate in the shot department, outshooting the Mustangs 23-12, but Cal Poly’s senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton was able to make seven big saves to help his team to victory.<br>\nHamilton currently sits at second in the Big West with a 1.01 goals against average.</p>\n<p>“Saturday was really tough. I thought we deserved to win and with seven minutes left they score off a corner kick. It was a pretty crazy environment,” Justin Vom Steeg said. “I’m really looking forward to this Saturday to get some revenge and hopefully we can show them up with a big victory in front of our home crowd.”</p>\n<p>The large audience tied for the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history, but will likely be even bigger this Saturday at Harder Stadium, which seats 17,000. The Blue-Green rivalry is considered the greatest rivalry in college soccer for a reason, as evidenced by the fact that the two sides have provided 12 of the 18 largest audiences in college soccer since 1980.</p>\n<p>Looking at how the two teams have fared against one another over the years, UCSB has come away with the advantage at 45-18-7. However, the Mustangs have done well to flip the script in recent years, outdueling the Gauchos to the tune of a 4-3-2 record through their last nine meetings.</p>\n<p>While many Gaucho supporters are looking at this storied rivalry’s upcoming installment as a chance for revenge, Jome summed up his team’s mindset in two words: “Just win.” Regardless of all the hype, statistics and big names involved in this game, we’ll just have to wait for Saturday to see what happens.</p>\n<p>The second Blue-Green rivalry matchup of 2015 will kick off at 7 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 13 of October 22, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/","id":1487,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1486,1485,1484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy: UCSB’s Humble Beast","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Over the past 13 months, Nick DePuy has meant everything to the Gauchos.

The UCSB men’s soccer team is coming off an excellent bounce-back year in which it went undefeated in conference play on the way to a second round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg knows that things are going to be different this time around, as he has to replace nearly half of his team’s goal scoring production which previously came from graduated senior forwards Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion.</p>\n<p>Nearing the midpoint of the season, things haven’t been going so well. The Gauchos have struggled to score goals and have managed a record of 2-3-1 through six games – not nearly up to UCSB’s high standards.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Having tried nearly everything he could think of in search of goals, Vom Steeg is forced to make a big decision in the final weekend before conference play begins.</p>\n<p>Thus begins the story of Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>“We were at the point in our season where we were below .500. We had tried every forward combination we had and we couldn’t get results from them,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick was our next best option as a big target player with good size. It was a little bit out of desperation in terms of putting him up front, but we had seen a lot of things in practice that told us he might do well.”</p>\n<p>Playing San Diego State on September 26 of last year, DePuy, a sophomore who had seen limited playing time being moved around the midfield and center back positions, got his first ever start at forward. Prior to that game, the 6-4 Irvine native had just one career goal, scored three weeks prior in a 1-1 tie against Northwestern.</p>\n<p>Little did anyone know, this season was about to get turned around in a big way.</p>\n<p>“I knew especially after my freshman year when we had a lot of seniors graduate that we were kind of low on the offensive side,” DePuy said. “I just wanted to work as hard as I could and help the team, whether that’s on defense or going up top and scoring a goal.”</p>\n<p>And help his team he did, as he capitalized on his first start as the team’s leading offensive option by tapping home a goal in the 21st minute. The 1-0 result got UCSB back on track as it headed into Big West play, sparking a season-best run of four straight wins.</p>\n<p>Not only did DePuy notch the first of his nation-best 13 game-winners over the past 13 months, but he began cementing his spot as the focal point in the Gauchos’ offense.</p>\n<p>“He got us the goal, he won the game, and that’s going to lead to the next start, which leads to another goal and another start,” Vom Steeg said. “If you’re looking for goals and you’re getting goals, you’re not going to mess with that. After five or six games, we saw that up front could be the place for him.”</p>\n<p>Having been voted the overwhelming favorites to finish first in the North Division in the 2014 Big West Preseason Coaches Poll, the Gauchos entered conference play last year at 4-3-1 and well short of living up to their own standards.</p>\n<p>Facing Cal State Northridge in its Big West opener, UCSB was able to overcome a 1-0 deficit thanks to a 71st minute winner by DePuy, who headed in a far post cross from teammate Drew Murphy back across the six-yard box.</p>\n<p>Neither the weekend nor DePuy were done at that point. Just two days later, UC Irvine came to town boasting a No. 3 national ranking as it looked to steal one on the road.</p>\n<p>In one of the most memorable moments in UCSB’s recent history, DePuy stunned the Anteaters with an unbelievable strike from 30 yards out, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead with just 37 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I had a good chance early in that game and I knew I had to get that one back. I got the ball, I just wanted to hit it on frame and it went right where I wanted it to go,” DePuy said. “That was probably my most memorable goal here, especially since it was at home in front of a couple 1,000 people and against Irvine.”</p>\n<p>With his second game-winner in three nights, and despite never having played forward for an extended period of time, the now former midfielder was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, earning both a Big West Offensive Player of the Week and a National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>“Things definitely started moving pretty fast after that. It was an honor,” DePuy said. “I’m glad I could get that achievement, but in the back of my head, obviously I was just thinking, ‘Help this team win,’ and I’m glad I could do that.”</p>\n<p>Never one to boast about his individual achievements, the team-first attitude that DePuy has made evident every time he steps on the field is a key reason for why he has been so dominant over the past two seasons. It certainly hasn’t hurt in building a high level of trust with his head coach, as he continues to prove that he can get the job done each and every time he steps on the field.</p>\n<p>“It’s a team sport. I wouldn’t be able to score those goals if someone didn’t cross it, and we wouldn’t win without our defense,” DePuy said. “I think [Vom Steeg] understands the trust aspect, that I’m going to work hard for my teammates and I’m a good forward that’s going to hold up the play. That helps a lot in the sense that we’ve known each other for two years already and we still have another year and a half to go.”</p>\n<p>Starting at forward the rest of the season, DePuy went on to score six game-winners and 10 goals overall – good for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ever since making his first start at forward 30 games ago, DePuy has many times been the only difference between UCSB winning or losing. In games that he has scored, the Gauchos have a near-perfect, undefeated mark of 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>“Our success this year, it’s no surprise, will start and end with how Nick does in terms of him scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “When he scores goals, we win.”</p>\n<p>Proving that his breakout season was no fluke, the junior started his 2015 campaign the best way possible, scoring another decisive header against No. 9 Stanford in a 1-0 season-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Things seemed to start following the same script every game, as in the Gauchos’ first four Big West games this year, DePuy scored five goals – four of them game-winners.</p>\n<p>His list of streaks and achievements now reads like a perennial All-Star’s. At one point this season, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and three consecutive Big West Player of the Weeks, making him the first player ever to accomplish that feat. His total of five conference awards has him tied for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Prior to last Wednesday’s game at Sacramento St., DePuy had scored an incredible 21 goals in 26 games, more than any player in the nation over that stretch. He currently sits atop the country with seven game-winners in 2015 and is tied for second with 12 scores.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen situations this year where Nick has really started to take over games and be completely dominant,” Vom Steeg said. “Now, we just need him to keep going in that direction.”</p>\n<p>It’s remarkable what DePuy has been able to accomplish, especially considering the fact that he had never been a permanent forward in his life prior to last season. As is the case with many breakout situations, it has been a combination of raw talent and excellent coaching that has led to all this success.</p>\n<p>“We recruited Nick on 100 percent potential. Here was this really big, athletic midfielder who was mobile, had good feet, and a good first touch,” Vom Steeg said. “Once we’ve decided that he’s a forward, there is a set of skills that you need to work on in order to be a good forward. My job as a coach is to keep pushing him and keep encouraging him that the sky’s the limit.”</p>\n<p>Another huge contributing factor has been the play of DePuy’s supporting cast, particularly during this season. A couple of left-footed forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong have joined DePuy atop the Big West stat charts, with the former ranking third in shots and the latter tied for the conference lead in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>“We’ve created a pretty good environment for [the players],” Vom Steeg said. “Nick doesn’t get those chances if he doesn’t have good players around him. He’s got Ahinga working hard for him, he’s got service coming, and now he just needs to keep doing his part.”</p>\n<p>Up next for DePuy and UCSB is a huge game against Cal Poly this Saturday. Sitting in first place in the standings, the Gauchos will be relying on their superstar to bring them the postseason glory they have worked all year for.</p>\n<p>Win or lose, though, DePuy will continue to be fueled by his competitive fire and the desire to play the game he loves.</p>\n<p>“I’m loving my time at UCSB right now,” he said. “I’m loving the soccer, too. I enjoy it every time I play.”</p>\n<p>Whatever happens down the stretch of this season, one thing is for sure: we’re all just lucky that he’s only a junior.</p><div

soccer team in 2015. With just four games remaining in the regular season, the Gauchos play UC Davis today and No. 20 Cal Poly on Saturday, leading both teams by just a point for first place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Two straight losses on the road has set Santa Barbara back to a record of 9-5-1 overall and 4-2 in the conference. Meanwhile, Davis enters today’s game at Harder Stadium at 7-6-2 overall, 3-1-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Our season does in effect come down to this week,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Last week is done, but we can’t forget why we lost both games. I’m excited that our guys are going to show up tomorrow and play really hard against a team that’s been playing really well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting conference play a perfect 4-0, the Gauchos crashed back down to Earth with a rough 5-2 loss at Sacramento St. last Wednesday. Playing at rival Cal Poly just three days later, UCSB was unable to hold on late, falling 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>“The Big West conference is not kind. You have to play well in every game,” Vom Steeg said. ”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they will get a shot to play both teams again, this time on their home field. UCSB has once again had its fair share of success playing under the lights of Harder Stadium, owning a 5-1 mark at home this season.</p>\n<p>Getting back on the winning track may just have to do with the play of junior forward Nick DePuy. With seven game-winners this year, DePuy has more than any player in the nation. His 12 scores overall is tied for second.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 Irvine native had scored in five consecutive games prior to last week’s two-game road trip, and it seems to be no coincidence that when his streak ended, so did his team’s. In games where DePuy has scored over the last two seasons, UCSB has gone an undefeated 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>Giving support on the Gauchos’ offensive front is a wide combination of attacking options that includes three dangerous lefties.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani ranks second in the Big West in shots with 43, behind only DePuy. The pressure he has applied to back lines this year tells much more than his three goal, two assist stat line will.</p>\n<p>A leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year in Geoffrey Acheampong has been the Gauchos’ best creator all season. To go along with his three goals, the forward’s seven assists ranks first in the conference and seventh in the nation. He has recorded a point in eight of UCSB’s last ten games, accumulating a record of 7-2-1 when he has scored or assisted this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last two outings also saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome from an ankle sprain that kept him out for nearly eight full games. Proving that he’s back and ready to make an impact heading into the postseason, Jome put away a goal in each of last week’s losses – his first two scores of the season.</p>\n<p>With most of the starting lineup ready to go at this point, the pressure falls on UCSB’s defense to get the job done as it tries to secure a No. 1 seed. The Gauchos have conceded 11 goals in their six conference games this season, just one less than last-ranked Sac St. and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“To be 14, 15 games into the season and dominating games, but then giving up excellent scoring opportunities, it’s a recipe for disaster,” Vom Steeg said. “The way we’re going to bounce back is with a renewed commitment to defending. Not just our defenders, but some of our forwards coming down. We need to go back from giving up eight goals last week to giving up none, or one.”</p>\n<p>For the Aggies, defense has not been as much of an issue, giving up just six through six Big West games. They own the conference’s longest active unbeaten streak at four games, all of which went into overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg has scored seven goals this season to lead the offense, tied for second in the conference. More recently, redshirt freshman defender Roy Boateng has given solid production, recording a brace in a 3-2 win over Cal Poly last Wednesday and picking up the assist on Davis’s lone goal against Sac St. on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s focus tonight will be solely on getting a win, but win or lose, that focus will quickly shift to Saturday’s game with Cal Poly. The Mustangs are also in action tonight, playing Sac St. at home as they look to surpass both UCSB and Davis in the standings.</p>\n<p>“Every year it comes down to something like this,” Vom Steeg said. “When you’re the team that gets the bullseye like we do, we have to rise to that challenge every time we play. The players know what’s at stake and I believe they are committed to give us the effort that we need.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set for kickoff tonight at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/","id":1483,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1482,1481,1480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Preparing For Competitive Finish to the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer9-26ChristinaDeMarzo7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer9-26ChristinaDeMarzo7-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With just four conference matches left on the season, the UCSB women's soccer team prepares for the final stretch of its season before the start of the Big West Tournament on Nov. 5th.

The Gauchos start a tough road ahead as all four teams are in contention for a playoff spot including 3-2 UC Riverside and 2-2 UC Irvine. This is familiar news for Stumpf, though.</p>\n<p>“Every year heading into the last weekend of the season, six or seven teams of the nine teams total still have a mathematical chance at the tournament,” said Stumpf. “[Because of this], every game is critical. If you have one game a year against somebody and you’re better than them you need to get the result.”</p>\n<p>UC Riverside heads into its Friday night match ranking in the top four in goals with 23. Much of the Highlanders’ scoring can be accredited to redshirt junior midfielder Blanco Barrio. The San Bernardino native scored both goals in the Highlander’s 2-1 road victory on Friday against then No. 1 Long Beach State. The 49ers had been undefeated until their loss last weekend.</p>\n<p>Barrio’s performance was acknowledged on Monday as she earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award. Barrio now leads the team in scoring with 16 points off five goals and six assists, good for fifth place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The junior midfielder will not be suiting up for the Highlanders after being issued two late yellow cards in their 1-0 loss to Fullerton on Sunday.</p>\n<p>For UC Irvine, look for sophomore forward Kiana Palacios and sophomore midfielder Alex Karlowitsch to be the primary weapons on offense. The two sophomores lead the team in scoring with two goals apiece and a combination of 12 points. Palacios finished with a team-high five shots and one go-ahead goal on Sunday, leading to a 2-0 victory over Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Containing Palacios and Karlowitsch in the open field will be a big focus for the Gauchos and junior defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes played a central role in Santa Barbara’s two wins over Cal Poly and Davis. The junior from San Clemente earned the Big West Defensive Player of the Week award after her contributions on the defensive line.</p>\n<p>UCSB will honor its seniors prior to Friday night’s match with UC Riverside. Kickoff will take place at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will welcome UCI on Sunday at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/ucsb-preparing-for-competitive-finish-to-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/ucsb-preparing-for-competitive-finish-to-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/ucsb-preparing-for-competitive-finish-to-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/ucsb-preparing-for-competitive-finish-to-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/ucsb-preparing-for-competitive-finish-to-the-season/","id":1484,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1483,1482,1481],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Silences Cal Poly in Shutout Victory, Late Score Prevents Overtime Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?resize=392%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team continues to climb its way up the Big West standings with wins over Cal Poly and UC Davis in the past week.

In addition, Santa Barbara is now third in the Big West standings, just one-match behind tying first place Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos controlled possession from the first whistle, racking up five corner and five shot attempts by the end of the first half.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65523\" style=\"width: 238px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1119098947\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65544\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65523\" data-attachment-id=\"65523\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/christinademarzo_womenssoccer_10-15-15_5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?fit=392%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"392,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Hannah Dearborn sets the ball for a teammate, gaining an assist.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Santa Barbara to put a point on the board as sophomore midfielder Dakota Griggs lined up for her third corner in the 12<sup>th</sup> minute, sending a perfect cross for sophomore defender Kate Shoemaker. Grigg’s pass had just enough hang time for Shoemaker to beat her defender and head the ball into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“I told myself let’s put this game away from the beginning and not let it go on,” Shoemaker explained. “Even if you’re the better team, if you don’t put away the ball you could lose [the match] so I just took a chance to get a goal.”</p>\n<p>The score marked Shoemaker’s second goal of the season. Prior to the goal, her lone score of the year came during UCSB’s 3-2 non-conference win over Saint Francis on September 13<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter also made her presence known on the defensive end, tallying three saves in the first half including a diving grab in the 25<sup>th</sup> minute off the shot attempt of Cal Poly midfielder Emily Hansen.</p>\n<p>Replacing junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia, Ritter has now started seven out of UCSB’s 16 matches this season. The Danville native ranks among the top five in the Big West in goals against average at .86 and total goals against with seven. Caginia holds a first place ranking in goals against in the Big West at five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos resumed their offensive attack in the second half as senior Savannah Francis lined up for a free kick in the 67<sup>th</sup> minute. Shooting from 30 yards out, Francis placed a ball just in the reach of sophomore forward Amanda Ball to head it past diving junior goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti to the back left corner of the goal. This was Ball’s first score of the year since coming off an injury on August 28<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ closest chance at goal was in the 40<sup>th</sup> minute off the crafty footwork of freshman forward Caitlyn Kreutz. Kreutz beat junior defender Sydney Feurtes and freshman forward Marrisa Salvoldi down the left flank placing a line drive to the left of the net only to be met by Ritter.</p>\n<p>Things got chippy in the 69<sup>th</sup> minute as Emily Hansen and Jessica Parque scrambled for the ball around center field. After throwing an inadvertent elbow at Parque, Hansen was issued a red card and ejected from the game. A total of 25 fouls were issued between the two rivals, two yellow cards and one red card given to the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos closed things off in the 75<sup>th</sup> minute as junior forward Hannah Dearborn stole the ball from a Cal Poly defender and led a two-on-one attack with Parque. Off the give-and-go from Dearborn, Parque took advantage of Giannetti’s misjudgment to try to save the ball and booted a kick to the back of the net for the score. The goal pushed UCSB’s lead to 3-0. Another goal from Dearborn in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute gave her team a comfortable lead, ending the match in a 4-0 victory. Cal Poly’s loss to its rival dropped the Mustangs to 5-6-5 and 1-4 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to take care of business Sunday in their match against the UC Davis Aggies. With the match tied at one a piece heading into the second half, freshman forward Mallory Hromatko led an attack down the line in the 86<sup>th</sup> minute. She took a pass from freshman defender Ryan Kokoska and launched a kick to the upper left corner of the goal past Davis’ redshirt freshman goalkeeper Alexis Smith for the score.</p>\n<p>This was Hromatko’s seventh goal of the year and her fourth game-winner of the season. The freshman’s late score sealed the deal for her team as Santa Barbara secured the win with a final score of 2-1. The loss lands UC Davis with an overall record of 8-6-2 and 1-3-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two home games at Harder Stadium next weekend hosting the Highlanders of UC Riverside at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 23<sup>rd</sup>. On Sunday, Oct. 25<sup>th</sup>, Santa Barbara will pay tribute to its seniors in a 1:00 p.m. match against UC Irvine.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/","id":1479,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1478,1477,1476],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Second Straight in Front of Near-Record Crowd at No. 20 Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is now in a tight race for the No. 1 seed in the Big West North after losing its second straight game.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65525\" style=\"width: 317px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"91945414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65525\" data-attachment-id=\"65525\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/kevin-feucht-battles-the-ball-away-from-a-defender-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Kevin Feucht battles the ball away from a defender.

They entered the game at Cal Poly coming off a disappointing 5-2 loss to Sacramento State, but that motivation wasn’t enough to get them the win in a hostile Mustang environment.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As this matchup always seems to do, the game between the Blue-Green rivals lived up to the billing. An action-filled 103 minutes of entertainment in front of the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history found the opposing sides deadlocked at two goals apiece before Mustang junior defender Kody Wakasa ended it in the second period of extra time.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just lost junior midfielder Josue Espana to his second yellow card before conceding a corner for the fifth time in the game. Having just come in off the bench, Cal Poly junior defender Jack O’Connor sent in a cross towards the near post that found Wakasa, who was able to flick in a shot towards the far post.</p>\n<p>The goal, which was the first of Wakasa’s career, could not have come at a better time, as it now puts Cal Poly tied with UC Davis just one point behind UCSB to challenge for the No. 1 seed in the North.</p>\n<p>Prior to the final shot, the Gauchos had more than doubled Cal Poly’s shot production at 23-11. However, the Mustangs had been on target all night, putting 8-12 shots on frame compared to just 9-23 for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in just the seventh minute, as UCSB junior left back Ismaila Jome scored for the second straight game coming off an ankle sprain. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who has been playing well lately, found Jome at the top of the box. The left-footed winger showed why he’s been considered one of the most dangerous players in the conference over the past three seasons, curling a shot into the top right corner to put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The assist also gave Feucht a point for the third consecutive outing after he scored a goal in each of UCSB’s previous two games.</p>\n<p>It took less than four minutes for the Mustangs to respond, as junior forward Justin Dhillon worked his way into the UCSB penalty area before passing to junior defender Ruben Duran, who put in the early equalizer.</p>\n<p>A frenetic first half continued as Cal Poly’s Kip Colvey fired a shot in off freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg in the 30th minute to give his team its first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The scoring wasn’t done yet, as right before the 39th minute, a corner by UCSB freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong created a scramble in the box. Junior midfielder Seo-In Kim capitalized on the loose ball to score his first goal of the season, tying it at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Acheampong’s assist gave him seven on the year, two more than any other player in the conference. Having recorded a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 10 games, Acheampong is a leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game also marked the second straight time that UCSB junior forward Nick DePuy did not score. Prior to the game at Sac St., he had notched a goal in five consecutive games, all Gaucho wins. Against Cal Poly, DePuy nearly scored with a shot off the post in the 36th minute, but wasn’t able to put away any of his five shots on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s success this season may very well depend on whether or not it sees DePuy back in the scoring column this week. In games that the former midfielder has scored in, UCSB is a near-perfect 15-0-3. With the Gauchos hosting two crucial home games this week against both Davis (Wednesday) and Cal Poly (Saturday), their hopes of clinching the No. 1 seed and home field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament for the third consecutive year could be determined in the next five days.</p>\n<p>The game on Saturday drew an astounding crowd of 11,075 people. Since 1980, the Blue-Green Rivalry between the two teams has drawn 12 of the 18 largest crowds in men’s soccer. The two teams could add to that number this upcoming Saturday. When UCSB hosted Cal Poly last year, it drew the second-largest crowd in history.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game will be played this Wednesday at home against UC Davis as they look to find some separation in the Big West standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/","id":1476,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1475,1474,1473],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sacked at Sac St., Face Cal Poly Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Suffering its first loss of the season, UCSB will travel to face Cal Poly in a hostile environment this Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five was the magic number for the UCSB men’s soccer team coming into yesterday’s road matchup at Sacramento St., as it looked to win its fifth straight game to open conference play.

The Hornets had played eight of their first 10 games on the road, getting them off to a 3-6-1 start. However, they entered their home matchup with the Gauchos with a solid 2-1-1 record at Hornet Field.</p>\n<p>After a strong first half effort by the Hornets sent them into the break with a 2-0 lead over UCSB, the Gauchos came out strong in the second stanza. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored for the second consecutive game in the 47th minute, putting in a rebound to cut the lead in half.</p>\n<p>In the 64th minute, Sac St.’s Ivan Ramirez extended the Hornets’ lead off a Gaucho turnover. The junior midfielder led a breakaway before dribbling around UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to finish into the open net, making it 3-1.</p>\n<p>Just 20 minutes later, the Hornets ended any hope of a late comeback with another goal from junior defender Preston Davis.</p>\n<p>It took only 34 seconds for junior left back Ismaila Jome to answer back for UCSB. Playing in his first game since suffering an ankle injury nearly a month ago, Jome capitalized on a Sac St. turnover before firing a shot over the keeper, giving him his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Already on their way to defeat, the Gauchos conceded yet another goal in the 88th, with Sac St.’s junior defender Argenis Ramos scoring another rebound goal for his team.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Brad Bumgarner has led the Hornets all season on the offensive side and he didn’t disappoint in the first half. After picking up an assist on teammate senior forward Isaac Flores’ goal to open the scoring in the 24th minute, Bumgarner scored one of his own in the 34th, giving him a team-leading five goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Hornets 19-17 on the night, Vom Steeg was only able to make two saves on the night as his record as a starter fell to 9-3. UCSB had not conceded more than two goals all season prior to yesterday’s game.</p>\n<p>Last night also marked the end of forward Nick DePuy’s run of five consecutive games scoring. The junior still leads the Big West in goals by a wide margin with 12 on the year, five more than any other player. UCSB is a near perfect 15-0-3 when DePuy scores.</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on the Gauchos’ first goal against Sac St. gave freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong six on the year, also the most in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly, the No. 27 ranked team in the RPI rankings as of October 12.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has scored only 16 goals this season, just one more than the conference’s worst goal scoring teams, but has found success thanks to its stifling defense.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have gotten off to a 2-1-1 start in conference, allowing just 0.95 goals per game, good for second best in the Big West. Senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton has led the way with a 0.95 goals against average, the second best mark in the conference. As a team, Cal Poly has five shutouts this season, tied with Cal State Fullerton for a number one ranking.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played, UCSB came away with a huge 2-0 win on the road. This will be the first of two Blue-Green matchups that will take place in the span of seven days, as Cal Poly will come to play at Harder Stadium next Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/","id":1478,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1477,1476,1475],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Shifts Focus to Annual Blue-Green Clash","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo1-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos’ last victory over the Mustangs came in a 2-1 home win back in 2011.

Santa Barbara holds a record of 8-4-1 overall and an even 1-1 conference standing. The Mustangs enter Harder Stadium with a record of 5-5-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite its loss, this past weekend was a learning experience for the young Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>UCSB started four freshmen against Long Beach including midfielder Sydney Magnin and forward Mallory Hromatko. Although they did not score a goal, the two helped get touches to sophomore forward Amanda Ball and senior forward Savannah Francis, who both returned from injuries in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>“It’s great getting these experienced players back on the field,” junior defender Sydney Fuertes said. “This allows our subs to maintain the same level of play the game started at and mix [it] up depending on the personnel.”</p>\n<p>Francis and Ball have been sidelined for the majority of the season, Ball being out since UCSB’s 1-1 tie versus San Jose State on Aug. 28. The two have made an impact in their two games back combining for seven shots and one goal.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Gauchos’ offensive production has been a result of their younger players’ contributions as the freshmen have scored 13 out of UCSB’s 20 goals, a team well on its way to surpassing its mark of 32 goals in 2014. Of the 13 goals, Hromatko has really taken the lead in the attacking third.</p>\n<p>“[These freshman] have not been intimidated by this new environment of college soccer,” Stumpf said. “Their ability to make adjustments on the fly and incorporate it in their games highlights their high [soccer] IQ. What we’re asking them to do in short order has been a pleasant surprise for us.”</p>\n<p>Hromatko has started all 13 games at forward for the Gauchos tallying in a team-high six goals and four assists. Her six goals are tied for fourth place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Of the nine games that Hromatko has either scored or assisted UCSB has won seven contests. The freshman forward ranks among the top 10 in conference points, shots on goal percentage and game winners. Hromatko’s excellent performance has not gone unnoticed, earning a nomination for Big West Player of the Week three times this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve relied on a younger squad this year but they’ve really stepped up to the occasion,” said Fuertes. “It’s awesome seeing so many freshmen seizing this opportunity to help out the team.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end junior defender Sydney Fuertes has recently been the focal point for Santa Barbara’s backline. While individual stats don’t show it, Fuertes has helped the Gauchos’ defensive unit to a low .83 goals against average, good for third place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sydney] has all those great qualities of leadership by example, said Stumpf. “She’s not the best athlete but she’s smart and can anticipate things so well.”</p>\n<p>The San Clemente native also played a major role last season starting 19 matches as a sophomore for UCSB. Feurtes’ defensive contributions propelled her team to five shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>While Cal Poly is on a two-game losing streak, the Mustangs will be looking for another win against their rival. Hosting the Gauchos on Oct. 26 last season, the Mustangs used their home field to their advantage, scoring two early goals in the third and 14th minutes and securing a 2-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Caitlyn Kreutz and junior forward Megan Abutin will carry the load for the Mustang offense.</p>\n<p>Kreutz has quickly filled her role at the forward position for Cal Poly placing third in the Big West with seven goals. The freshman from Clovis has recorded a pair of goals in three matches this season, the last one coming off the Mustangs’ 7-2 victory over Hawaii on Oct. 4. Kreutz has been very disciplined in taking good looks at goal earning fourth place in the Big West with a shot percentage of .333.</p>\n<p>Megan Aubutin is the main facilitator of the Mustangs, setting up teammates and tallying in five assists on the year. It will be the offensive production of Kreutz and savvy decision making of Abutin that UCSB must be aware of.</p>\n<p>One final piece to the Mustang’s offense is senior forward Elise Krieghoff. Krieghoff has five goals on the year and 51 career goals during her four years at Cal Poly. Also a Clovis native, Krieghoff earned her ninth career Big West Player of the Week award after scoring one goal apiece in the Mustangs’ 1-1 tie against then No. 6 BYU and preseason top-25 team Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end the Gauchos face arguably the best goal keeper in the Big West, senior Alyssa Giannetti. Emerging as the defensive leader for her team, Giannetti is one of the premiere defensive players in conference ranking in the top five in saves and save percentage.</p>\n<p>“The challenge we face is it can’t just be something good to go in. It has to be special,” said Stumpf. “That’s what it’s going to take to beat someone like [Giannetti].”</p>\n<p>Starting all four years for the Mustangs, the keeper from Yorba Linda has racked up 80 saves this season, 25 more than any keeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on Cal Poly at Harder Stadium this Thursday. The match will kick off at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/","id":1480,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1479,1478,1477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Game Win Streak On the Line at Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have gone a perfect 4-0 to start Big West play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65268\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1895733115\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65306\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65268\" data-attachment-id=\"65268\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/msoccer_vsakron-20150925-dustinharris-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"While dribbling down the field, Duncan Backus looks for an open teammate.

The Hornets enter with the worst record in the North at 4-7-1 overall and 1-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re beginning to play with each other’s strengths and making sure we eliminate a lot of our weaknesses,” Acheampong said. “We’re taking it one at a time right now. The Sac. State game is one that we must win.”</p>\n<p>As a team that looks primed to head into the postseason with a No. 1 seed for the third-straight season, Santa Barbara’s success over the past year has been directly related to the contributions of forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>In games that the junior has scored, UCSB is a near unstoppable 15-0-3. Since moving to forward from the midfield in 2014, DePuy has scored 21 goals in 26 games, the most in the nation during that stretch.</p>\n<p>Recently, DePuy’s production has been as consistent as ever. He has a Big West-leading 12 goals and has scored in five consecutive games, all UCSB wins, notching the game-winner in four straight games.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s work on the field has earned him three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards, making him the first to ever do so. Now totaling five in his career, he has moved into a tie for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>All this consistent success has put DePuy in the national spotlight. With three goals and two game-winners on the road in the conference’s opening weekend, the Irvine native earned his second career National Player of the Week award. With seven game-winners this season, he has two more than anyone else in the country.</p>\n<p>While DePuy has done all he can for his team, a couple of first-year Gaucho forwards in freshman Geoffrey Acheampong and sophomore Ahinga Selemani have given UCSB the much-needed support in the attacking third that it lacked last season.</p>\n<p>“I like to always be on the field, I like to always help the team, I like to contribute, and that’s what I’ve done,” Acheampong said. “That’s what I’ve done all my life and that’s what I look to do at UCSB. I do what I can with my talent to beat my man or find Nick in the box, and he’s kind of hard to miss.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong’s success has also correlated with the team’s success, as he has scored or assisted in six of the Gauchos’ last eight games. He is currently tied for first in the Big West with five assists, and UCSB has a record of 7-0-2 when the Cate School graduate has recorded a point.</p>\n<p>Another left-footed attacker in Selemani is tied with Acheampong with three goals for second-best on the team to go along with two assists. The transfer from Michigan has put the pressure on defenses all season, ranking fourth in the conference with 36 shots.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to make sure that we use all of our bodies, make sure that everybody’s fresh,” Selemani said. “You could tell the last couple games we’ve been getting tired. I think it’s important that everybody’s ready and focused because anyone can be called upon the next couple games to give good minutes and get us a win.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB has tallied 27 goals for the year, averaging over two per game and nearly matching its 2014 total of 30. Dating back to last season, Santa Barbara has won seven straight conference games and is undefeated in nine straight.</p>\n<p>“We have to go in with the mentality as the alpha team and go in and dominate,” Acheampong said. “We go in with the mentality that we have to have those games. When it’s clear that that’s the goal of the team and that is what everybody’s coming in to do, it makes it a lot easier.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has gotten off to a great start to his NCAA career with a record of 9-2. His goals against average of 0.89 ranks second in the conference, while his .787 save percentage is the third-best mark.</p>\n<p>Sac. State doesn’t possess nearly the same kind of firepower as its North Division counterpart, scoring just 15 on the season, one more than last-ranked Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>While the Hornets enter tomorrow’s game well under .500, their record isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of how good a team they are. A rough schedule to open the season saw them play eight of their first 10 games on the road. When playing at home, they are a much better team, going 2-1-1 in four outings.</p>\n<p>Sac. State’s only conference win came at home in a 3-2 victory over UC Irvine. Sophomore goalkeeper James Del Curto recorded 14 saves in that game, the most of any player in Division I soccer this season. He ranks second in the Big West with an average of 4.5 saves per game, a stat which could be inflated due to a defense that has allowed the second-most goas in the conference at 1.7 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt freshman forward Brad Bumgarner leads the way with four goals. A balanced attack has seen five other Hornets score two goals.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven-year Head Coach Michael Linenberger earned Big West Coach of the Year honors in 2014 as Sac. State qualified for the Big West Tournament for the first time since joining the conference four years ago.</p>\n<p>The game is set to kickoff at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow at Hornet Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/","id":1477,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1476,1475,1474],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LBSU Ends Gauchos’ Three-Game Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"UCSB gets shutout for the first time in 11 games as it falls to the 49ers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65226\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"423318898\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65245\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65226\" data-attachment-id=\"65226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/angelisa-cortez-charges-toward-the-goal-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Angelisa Cortez charges toward the goal.

The trio combined for three of UCSB’s five shots in the half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ best opportunity in the first period was a corner kick in the 10th minute as Schornstein sent a header towards the back of the net only to be snagged by Long Beach goalkeeper Ashton McKeown.</p>\n<p>McKeown has been a force behind goal for the 49ers, leading the Big West with a save percentage of .877. The junior from Huntington Beach, CA has recorded ten saves in her three previous Big West appearances, adding five more in Sunday’s contest.</p>\n<p>“It was a combination of [missed scores] and [a] very good goal keeper [at] play in today’s match,” Stumpf said. “We had one good look at it [in the first half] but [McKeown] made one great save.”</p>\n<p>Despite an aggressive 45 minutes of controlling possession 59 to 41, Santa Barbara went into halftime locked in a 0-0 gridlock.</p>\n<p>“We took the ball away from them and created more chances than [Long Beach] did, but just didn’t stick one away,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept an aggressive tone starting the second period as two yellow cards were issued in the first 10 minutes to junior defender Sydney Fuertes and junior midfielder Sara Feder.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute Feder responded on the offensive end, cutting past the 49er defensive line and sending a kick from 15 yards out, but it ricocheted out of bounds.</p>\n<p>Still locked at zero, the Gauchos had another chance in the 67th minute from sophomore defender Kate Shoemaker. Schornstein found Shoemaker off a free kick and Shoemaker headed the ball just to the left of the net. A diving save, however, from the 49ers’ McKeown kept her team alive and the match at a stalemate.</p>\n<p>The game ultimately came down to the 76th minute as Long Beach State’s Vania Robles moved her way into the box and popped the ball over the UCSB backline for sophomore forward Ashley Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Although Gonzalez was met at goal by junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia, a quick in-and-out move from the reigning Big West Freshman of the Year sent the ball down the line to the left corner of the net. This gave the 49ers a late 1-0 edge with 15 minutes remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>“We made one mistake in the back and paid a massive price for it,” Stumpf said. “Against a good team like Long Beach you have to play mistake free and unfortunately we just didn’t do it.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez has racked in six total goals on the year. The Ontario, CA native has been the X-factor since the start of the Big West for Long Beach, burying a game-winning overtime goal on Oct. 4 against defending Big West champions Cal State Fullerton. Gonzalez’s exceptional conference play also earned her the Big West Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos move to an even .500 in conference, junior Sydney Fuertes believes there are positives to take out of this tough match and this young team.</p>\n<p>“We definitely executed our game plan [today] all but finishing,” Fuertes said. “We dominated possession in the first and second half, but it was just a matter of someone making a play … our team worked till the end and now we know to put games away early.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos renew their blue-green rivalry against Cal Poly this Thursday.  The match will take place at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65245\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65245\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/","id":1387,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1386,1385,1384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Another Winner From DePuy Keeps Perfect Conf.

Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It took two overtimes, but the No. 13 UCSB men’s soccer team continued its perfect start to conference play with a 2-1 win over Cal State Fullerton at home this past Saturday. For the fourth straight game, junior forward Nick DePuy was the hero, scoring his nation-leading seventh game-winner of the season.</p>\n<p>With their fourth straight win to open conference and fifth overall, the Gauchos are now 9-3-1 overall and 4-0 in Big West. Fullerton was handed its first loss in conference play and falls to 7-5-1 overall and 2-1-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>In a defensive stalemate of a match, the Titans’ Julian Okai opened the scoring in the 77th minute. A long throw into the box from defender Zach Bryan took a deflection and fell to Okai about 10 yards away from goal. The senior midfielder volleyed it home for his first goal of the season, seemingly sending the Gauchos to their first home conference loss in their last 12 at Harder Stadium.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, it took less than a minute before DePuy was taken down in the box, earning the Gauchos a penalty kick. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht stepped up to fire a shot into the bottom left corner, tying it at 1-1. Feucht’s first ever Division I goal was also his first since playing for the University of Charleston last year, where he tallied seven as a freshman.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first overtime in which the Gauchos were outshot 3-1, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong hooked up with DePuy for UCSB’s decisive goal. Acheampong ended a nice run up the left wing before coming to a stop and sending a ball into the box. As he seems to do at least once every game, DePuy found space coming through the box and finished with a strong header, providing UCSB with yet another thrilling clutch moment.</p>\n<p>The goal sent UCSB to its seventh straight conference win dating back to last year and gave DePuy his 12th score in 13 games this season, tied for second in the nation. The Gauchos’ record in games where the junior scores improved to a virtually perfect mark of 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>In his 26 games as a forward, DePuy has scored 21 goals, another nation-leading stat during that stretch. Also having scored the game-winning goal against UCR on Thursday, DePuy earned his third consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Week, becoming the first player to ever accomplish the feat. With five weekly awards in his career, he is tied for third all-time in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was able to come away with a win despite recording only four shots on goal through 103 minutes, its lowest mark in a win since tallying just two in a 1-0 season-opening victory over No. 11 Stanford. Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg recorded four saves on the night, giving him a 9-2 record as a starter.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Acheampong picked up a point for the sixth time in the Gauchos’ last eight games. Similar to DePuy, the left-footed freshman’s statistical contributions have been a predictor of the team’s success. When Acheampong has scored or assisted this season, UCSB has gone an undefeated 7-0-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB will head back on the road this Wednesday for a game against Sacramento State as it looks to maintain its unbeaten conference record.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65260\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65260\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/","id":1501,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1500,1499,1498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vom Steeg Becomes First to Reach 100 Big West Wins After UCR Shutout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Nick DePuy records his nation-leading sixth game-winner as the Gauchos defeat UCR.

Santa Barbara’s third consecutive win to open up conference play gives Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg 100 Big West wins in his career, making him the first ever coach to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>“I told the team tonight we had an opportunity to go take a picture in front of the scoreboard and put it up on a wall somewhere,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s not just Tim Vom Steeg’s 100 wins, but it’s UCSB’s 100 wins.”</p>\n<p>Now winners in six of their last seven games, the Gauchos improve to 8-3-1 overall and a perfect 3-0 in conference. The Highlanders are now 5-6-1 overall and 1-2 in Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I thought that Riverside was one of the more dangerous teams that we’ll play all season long,” Vom Steeg said. “Credit to the players, I thought we made a real concerted effort to get a shutout tonight.”</p>\n<p>There wasn’t much to be excited about through the first 70 minutes of play, but that suddenly changed as the Gauchos were able to find the breakthrough off a left-footed strike by forward Nick DePuy. The goal was DePuy’s fifth in four games and his sixth game-winner of the season — the most of any player in the nation.</p>\n<p>“As the game goes on, you want to have Nick on your team,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point, all season long, he’s found the net.”</p>\n<p>The unstoppable junior now has a conference-best 11 goals on the season, already surpassing his total of 10 from last year. Since moving out of the midfield to forward midway through last season, DePuy has 20 goals in the Gauchos’ last 25 games, making him the country’s top goal scorer during that stretch.</p>\n<p>“I just make sure every chance I get I put on target,” DePuy said. “I’m learning each game and trying to get better each day. It takes a lot of practice and repetition, but I’ve been working hard and hopefully I can keep scoring.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played at Riverside in 2014, UCSB was just barely able to hold on to an ugly 1-1 tie despite playing with nine men down the stretch. Playing under the bright lights of Harder Stadium this time around, it looked like things would be different as UCSB came out firing, recording the first seven shots of the game.</p>\n<p>Good scoring chances were scarce, but the Gauchos found their first about 20 minutes in. After some well-worked passing, the ball came loose deep in the box where sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and DePuy both had chances to open the scoring.</p>\n<p>Selemani couldn’t make contact with his twisting effort, but the ball fell to DePuy’s feet right at the edge of the six-yard box. After a quick turn to aim toward the goal, DePuy was unable to get hold of the ball and sailed the shot high.</p>\n<p>Riverside wasn’t able to record a shot until the 21st minute, but the momentum seemed to switch from there as the Highlanders forced UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make three saves over a ten-minute stretch.</p>\n<p>DePuy had another good scoring chance to open the second half after a nice 1-2 combination with freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, but UCR’s senior goalkeeper Ashkan Khosravi kept it scoreless with a diving save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to open the scoring in the 70th minute. Quickly capitalizing on a turnover in play on his offensive half, DePuy found himself with enough space to get off a shot with his weaker left foot, slotting it past the keeper and inside the right post.</p>\n<p>“I was just thinking, ‘Take the guy on,'” DePuy said. “We had a chance in the first half and I kind of rushed it and hit it wide. I really wanted to just get my touch out in front of me, hit it low and hard, and that’s what I did.”</p>\n<p>With the game not yet decided, a moment of brilliance from Acheampong less than eight minutes later put the game away for UCSB. Attacking down the left wing, the Cate School graduate cleanly split a pair of UCR defenders in the box with a nifty, controlled dribble.</p>\n<p>A third defender rushed forward from the middle of the box, but the crafty freshman slipped by to set himself up on his favored left foot. Despite a difficult angle, Acheampong put his rocket left foot to work, blasting a shot past the keeper and inside the far post, clinching the 2-0 win.</p>\n<p>“Geoffrey was a handful on the outside for them,” Vom Steeg said. “In that situation, a double team, Geoffrey’s still going to look to play inbetween two and break through. He broke in with the idea of getting the shot off, hitting it hard and keeping it down, and it got us the second goal.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong is now tied with Selemani for second on the team with three goals to go along with his team-best four assists.</p>\n<p>“Effectively, that second goal was the game,” Vom Steeg said. “[Riverside is] a team that relies on one mistake and one shot. The minute that scores goes 2-0, now it’s going to take two shots. At that point, you can see their team just dropped off.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outshot Riverside 16-9 on the night, including seven shots from DePuy. The Gauchos earned their second shutout in their last eight games.</p>\n<p>With the win, Vom Steeg became the first coach in Big West history to reach the 100-win milestone. He now has a career record of 226-95-38 through 17 years as UCSB’s head coach, including a 100-28-17 record in conference games.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos is a home matchup with Cal State Fullerton on Saturday as they look to continue their hot start in conference play. The Titans are the only other Big West team that has gone undefeated in conference play thus far, going 2-0-1.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care particularly much for Fullerton. Last year we went down there and absolutely got manhandled in that game,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll absolutely be ready to play on Saturday. We’re going to compete we’re going to hit, score some goals, and we’re going to defend. Shutout number two, that will be the mission for the team.”</p>\n<p>The game with Fullerton will kickoff at 7 p.m. on Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/","id":1510,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1509,1508,1507],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two of Big West’s Best Face Off at Harder Stadium","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's soccer has won eight of its last nine matches.

Coming off a 1-0 victory against arguably the top team in the conference in Cal State Fullerton, this match will be essential for the Gauchos to prove they are a side to be reckoned with in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Last week’s matchup against the Rainbow Wahine was everything UCSB needed to start its conference play on a good note. Following a stagnant first half that featured one shot on goal, Santa Barbara tallied the first score of the game in the 72nd minute as sophomore forward Amanda Ball earned a penalty kick that she took herself, launching it into the back of the net. This was Ball’s first official goal of the season after missing the Gauchos’ previous eight matches due to injury.</p>\n<p>After Ball’s score, it didn’t take long for UCSB to follow up with another as freshman forward Jessica Parque drove down the left line and sank a shot past Wahine junior goalkeeper Monk Berger, extending her team’s lead to 2-0. A goal in the 86th minute by other freshman forward Mallory Hromatko wrapped things up for the Gauchos, handing them their first conference win of the season with a final score of 3-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_65038\" style=\"width: 401px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"922935573\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65111\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65038\" data-attachment-id=\"65038\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/wsoccer9-6-15christinademarzo13-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Running towards the goal, Mallory Hromatko makes a move for the ball.

Look for Long Beach to try and put sophomore forward Ashley Gonzalez in scoring position once again.</p>\n<p>The former Big West Freshman of the Year currently ranks seventh in conference this year with five goals. Gonzalez also scored the go-ahead-goal in the 82nd minute last October versus UCSB, leading Long Beach to a win.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had their share of success in non-conference play this year stealing two crucial wins, one at DePaul and another hosting UCLA.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach has two huge wins this year [against UCLA and DePaul],” Stumpf said. “So they’re a confident crew and it should lead to a great game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Long Beach State this Sunday at Harder Stadium. Kickoff will take place at 12 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/","id":1506,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1505,1504,1503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Reaching Peak With Undefeated Conf.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A successful pair of games on the road last weekend has made the UCSB men’s soccer team one of only two teams in the Big West to start a perfect 2-0 in conference play. This weekend, the Gauchos return home to welcome UC Riverside and the only other 2-0 team in Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“It was a great weekend playing what I think are two really tough teams on the road,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “But, as we know, last weekend doesn’t matter if we don’t take care of this weekend. We have to continue doing what we’ve been doing over the past four weeks now and find a way to win conference games.”</p>\n<p>A three-game win streak has brought UCSB’s record to 7-3-1 overall and 2-0 in conference, giving it sole possession of first place in the Big West North. The Highlanders come to town at 5-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West. The Titans, currently at 7-4 overall, 2-0 Big West and in first place in the South, will arrive on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Gauchos, every week has seemed to tell the same story for quite some time. The name of that story? Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offensive front man has so many scoring streaks and statistical anomalies going for him right now, it’s hard to keep track. With a brace in his last game and three goals in the conference’s opening weekend, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>“What he’s doing right now is really remarkable,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s been one of the best runs we’ve had out of any forward. One of the huge advantages this year is he’s got players around him that can give him the ball. We have players around him that are dangerous and that can score, so that means [the defense] can’t really concentrate all their energies on one player.”</p>\n<p>The junior has now scored in three consecutive games, giving him a Big West leading total of 10 through just 11 games, which matches his 2014 total. Since moving to forward from the midfield last year, he has compiled 19 goals in 24 games. In UCSB’s 15 wins during that stretch, DePuy has scored 11 game-winners. His total of five game-winners in 2015 has him in the top five in the nation.</p>\n<p>Backing him up on the offensive front has been a pair of first-year Gaucho forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong. Selemani has 34 shots to his name this season, good for second in the Big West behind DePuy’s 38 and is second on the team with three goals and eight points. Acheampong is currently tied for first in the conference with four assists to go along with two goals of his own to match Selemani with eight points.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has been strong in the net for the Gauchos. The freshman ranks fourth in conference with a .99 goals against average that has given him an excellent record of 7-2 through his first nine career starts.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Gauchos are undefeated in their last seven conference games dating back to last season, excluding the postseason. They are off to a 2-0 start for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos nearly missed out on the No. 1 seed after going winless in their first three conference road games, but they pulled together to either win or tie their last five games to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. With their first two conference wins of 2015 coming on the road, they are in excellent shape to earn a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament for the third-straight season.</p>\n<p>UCR travels to Harder Stadium today hoping it can win, or at least repeat the result it managed against the Gauchos last year. Playing on their home turf, the Highlanders frustrated and held UCSB to a 1-1 tie through 120 minutes. Playing at Harder Stadium this time around, Santa Barbara can expect a much different result.</p>\n<p>“If they come out trying to frustrate us, we’ve just got to give it right back to them,” freshman defender Sam Strong said. “We’ve just got to frustrate them more. Those are my type of games, so I’m excited.”</p>\n<p>Riverside possesses the conference’s second-best goal-scorer of the year in Norberto Ochoa. The redshirt senior forward has notched seven scores thus far, helping UCR to a third-best ranking in the Big West with 18 as a team. This is a big improvement compared to last season when the Highlanders managed just 21 all season.</p>\n<p>CSUF comes to town on Saturday coming off a game at Cal Poly tonight. If both the Titans and the Gauchos come away victorious tonight, then Saturday’s match will be a battle between the only two teams in the Big West to start 3-0.</p>\n<p>“What Fullerton has done in each of their games is kind of hung on, frustrated the other team and then found a way to score a goal,” Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think they’re going to come here with any intentions of running up and down the field with us. I think they’re going to try to maintain a good defense, put lots of players behind the ball and see if they can get something on a set piece or a breakout.”</p>\n<p>The Titans are led on offense by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez, who has five goals this season, and freshman forward Brandon West who has tallied three assists. Both marks are good for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Fullerton has been especially good on the defensive side since the start of September, earning six shutouts in its last nine games. The Titans rank second in the conference in goals against average, allowing just .91 goals per game, compared to UCSB’s third-best mark of 1.15.</p>\n<p>Junior defender Zach Bryan was largely responsible for the team’s great start to conference, leading the defense in last weekend’s 2-0 and 1-0 wins over Sacramento State and UC Davis, respectively. His efforts earned him the first Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors of the conference season and the first of his career.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will still be without junior left back Ismaila Jome, who has missed the last five games with an ankle injury. After trying to play through an injury since spring, junior midfielder Drew Murphy has been ruled out for the season after deciding to have surgery on his ankle.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to take on UCR at 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium before hosting CSUF on Saturday at the same time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/","id":1508,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1507,1506,1505],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":16,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
