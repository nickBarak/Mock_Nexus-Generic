The Gauchos were in search of clinching the No. 1 seed in the Big West North Division standings in their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p>A 0-0 draw was the final result of the weekday game as neither of the two teams managed to net goals during the 90 minutes of regulation play.  Nearly changing the match’s narrative was the forward-to-forward connection of freshman Rodney Michael and sophomore Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>In the match’s 58<sup>th</sup> minute, Michael sent a cross from the wing of the field to Tellechea, who then struck the ball into the net. Unfortunately, the play was called offside and the score still remained 0-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“If you think about it, that right there was the four, five goals we needed. So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Aim to End Season on a Positive Note vs Blue-Green Rival","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite not having any playoff implications, the Gauchos will still be looking to knock off their big-time rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79111\" style=\"width: 489px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/sydney-magnin-settles-a-pass-from-downfield-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79111\" data-attachment-id=\"79111\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/chos-aim-to-end-season-on-a-positive-note-vs-blue-green-rival/sydney-magnin-settles-a-pass-from-downfield-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-07-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sydney Magnin settles a pass from downfield.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite underwhelming efforts in the wins columns — UCSB at 6-8-4, 2-4-1 and Cal Poly at 7-9-2, 2-4-1 — they each have remained solid on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Cal Poly place third and fourth in the league in goals scored, with one goal separating the two at 23 and 22, respectively.</p>\n<p>One player who has contributed to this boost in offensive production by the Gauchos is freshman Christine Maurer. Maurer is second in goals (6) and shots (41) along with being tied for third place in the Big West in goals as well.</p>\n<p>The midfielder scored the game-winning goal against UC Davis last week and could be adding another one to her tally of netters against a Cal Poly team that is tied for second in the Big West in goals given up with 24 on the year.</p>\n<p>This stat is both advantageous and a concern for UCSB as it is the team that the Mustangs are tied for second with.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos have actually tightened up on defense as of late. They haven’t allowed more than one opponent goal in their last five games while Cal Poly has given up two goals in two of its last four.</p>\n<p>The play of UCSB’s goalkeeper, Maddie Julian, who is third in the league in goals against with only 11 so far, is certainly a big part of this recent stinginess.</p>\n<p>It also certainly helps to have a senior defender like Kate Shoemaker in the back for better communication as well.</p>\n<p>Communication and help on the defensive end are going to be crucial against this Cal Poly team who likes to attack individually and take lots of shots.</p>\n<p>Although they are ranked top four in the conference in goals, the Mustangs are tied for second to last in assists (14).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos are going to need a strong ‘man-on-man’ performance, in addition to an efficient effort when providing help defense as the Mustangs thrive on opponent errors and low pressure around the top of the box.</p>\n<p>One dimension the Gauchos will need to improve on is not falling behind early in the game. In almost all of their wins, they’ve scored first.</p>\n<p>This goes to show that their style of play is great at retaining leads; however, their losses show that they aren’t as good at playing from behind.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this game still means a lot for UCSB. Although they are out of the playoff picture, they still have a chance to climb up a few spots in the standings.</p>\n<p>Finishing the season off strong also is important for gaining motivation in the off-season and following season.</p>\n<p>Lastly, for a few of these players, this will be their last time stepping out onto Harder Field, and an opportunity to beat the Mustangs on a day like that is one that they can only hope to capitalize upon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Entering Wednesday, two matches remain on the Gauchos’ schedule. Now, much more is on the line as UCSB is not only trying to defend its home turf, but is also fighting for the No. 1 seed in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 5-0 loss to current first place UC Davis, Santa Barbara currently sits in second place with 14 points in the Big West Northern division standings. Following closely behind with 13 points is third place Sacramento State, who recently routed Cal Poly last weekend by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Wednesday will be the second meeting between the Gauchos and Hornets this season. Both teams initially faced each other last Wednesday at Hornet Field, which resulted in a 2-1 OT win for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the majority of the first match, both teams were knotted at one goal apiece. In the end, the Gauchos came out on top and handed the Hornets their third loss of their conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse against the Aggies over the weekend, the Gauchos’ defensive line will need to clean up its play to put themselves in the best position to possibly win. UCSB will be forced to keep its head on a swivel against a Hornets’ offense that is potent on the offensive end. Sac State currently boasts 11 different scorers on the year, who have combined for a total of 26 goals. In comparison, the Gauchos only have seven different scorers on the team and a combined total of 17 goals.</p>\n<p>More specifically, UCSB’s defensive agenda should have the names of Sac State’s two most productive players – Christian Webb and Justin Bedig – circled on its radar. Midfielder/forward Christian Webb currently still stands as his team’s leading goal scorer with six goals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bedig found himself doing both scoring and playmaking last week with a goal and assist for his team. Both players will enter Wednesday still with a hot hand approach, as the UCSB defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Alan Carillo, will hope to prevent the two from having many scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>As much as a defensive battle, UCSB’s offense will look for a repeat performance from its last time out against Sac State. In the 2-1 OT victory, it was freshman forward Rodney Michael’s moment as he notched both goals, including the golden goal, to lead the Gauchos to their victory.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’ll be up to the playmaking abilities of sophomore Ignacio Tellechea and senior defender Randy Mendoza, in addition to the hopeful return of sophomore forward Noah Billingsley who was absent in the Gauchos’ lopsided loss, that will be influential factors upon UCSB’s chance of winning in its final bout at Harder Stadium. All three players have contributed to a combined total of seven team assists on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the visiting Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It was the Gauchos who came out looking like the top ranked team however, as freshman midfielder Christine Maurer headed home a perfectly placed cross by Mallory Hromatko in the seventh minute to give them the 1-0 lead. That lead was almost doubled a few minutes later when sophomore Colby Parker sent in a corner kick that clanked off a few players and into the net, yet the goal was called back because of a foul on the goalie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half was marked by a flurry of shots by the Gauchos which couldn’t quite find home, yet continued to put enough pressure on the Aggies so that they couldn’t get into any sort of offensive rhythm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis came out stronger in the second half, a pattern which they have followed all year, yet UCSB maintained the same physicality and energy that they came out of the gates with. Even though the Aggies tripled the amount of shots they took compared to the first half and had five more corner kicks than the Gauchos, UCSB still finished with more shots and more quality shots at that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having taken care of business Thursday night, the Gauchos moved on to what they hoped was the next step to a Big West tournament and faced off against Cal State Fullerton. Although the Titans were ranked below UCSB and Davis in the Big West standings, they actually had the best record overall in the conference and were certainly the Gauchos biggest test up to that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans struck first when redshirt senior Connie Caliz knocked in a well-placed corner kick by forward Atlanta Primus. The rest of the first half played out in their favor as Maddie Julian had to make a few great saves for the Gauchos just to keep the margin to one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was never able to close that gap however as the offense stalled even more as the game went on. Opportunities by Sydney Magnin and Madeline Gibson offered moments of hope but it seemed like too much energy went to the stellar defense they played which left them drained on the attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead to next Sunday the Gauchos will be playing their season finale at Harder Stadium. Although the loss to Fullerton knocked UCSB down to eighth place in the Big West, their upcoming matchup against Cal Poly will be both an opportunity to beat their rivals and climb up to as far as fifth in the conference standings. Regardless of whether they can achieve a playoff berth or not the Gauchos will surely come out strong in the last game of the season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

In the 33rd minute, redshirt junior forward Matt Baringer found himself on the receiving end of a deflection, which he fired into the net for his fifth goal of the season. The unassisted effort added on to the team’s early lead, increasing the Aggies’ lead to 2-0, landing the Gauchos in an even deeper ditch.</p>\n<p>Right before the end of the first half, in the 41st minute, senior defender Kyle Higgins found himself on the breakaway while dribbling a pass from teammate Onah Power, managing to get past a Davis defender to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The first half was brought to an end with the Aggies on top 3-0, bringing back deja vu of the two teams’ previous match which ended with a 3-0 shutout victory.</p>\n<p>By halftime, the Gauchos defense had given up five shots to the Aggies and Carrillo did not manage to make a single save. The defense was shaky in the first half and was able to constantly create chances on the offensive end. The Davis defense was able to hold the Gauchos to no shots at halftime, as the home team just could not get too many good looks at the net.</p>\n<p>The second half kicked off and it was much of the same from the Davis offense. The rhythm the team had found in the first half had clearly continued into the second, with the team being able to notch another point on the board when Power was able to find senior Noah Wilson to make the game 4-0, in the 57th minute. Power notched his first two assists of the season to tie him for third best on the team.</p>\n<p>It was only five minutes later that the Aggies were able to score again with Mickelson striking yet again for his fourth goal on the season. The game ended 5-0 in favor of Davis.</p>\n<p>The multi-point nights from multiple Aggies in Saturday’s matchup were an indicator of the Gauchos’ collapse on defense. Excluding the first goal, each half had the scores occur within ten minutes of each other.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ various quick bursts on offense were able to cut through the Gauchos’ defense, who left too many open looks, too many times on the pitch. Davis finished with 12 shots, of which half were shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Carrillo ended the match with just one save. It was a tough night for the keeper who was outstanding in play last week. The UCSB offense was able to take four shots in the second half, but forced the Davis keepers to only make one save. Senior midfielder Seo-in Kim was responsible for both of the Gauchos’ two shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The five goals allowed and no goals scored performance by the Gauchos is a sign that the team and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg have some corrections to make upon the postseason’s arrival in the first week of November.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

However, it was UCSB who came out on top, and the subsequent three points awarded to the Gauchos were enough to not only place them at first in their division, but also at the very top of the entire Big West table standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Early on, many could tell that this matchup was going to be very much revolved around possession’s sake. Surprisingly, much of all play remained in the middle third of the pitch with very few attempts on goal or crosses to the middle even occurring. Officiating was also very sharp as several close offside decisions were called. Nonetheless, the Gauchos weren’t yet aware, but they were about to play their closest game of the year. Fortunately, it also turned out to be a significant win for them as well.</p>\n<p>Following kickoff, the first half started out very aggressively as it only took 10 minutes before UCSB was granted a yellow card. This would be the first yellow card out of a total of 4 through the remainder of the game as play was filled with consecutively fierce challenges.</p>\n<p>However, Sacramento State probably would have leveled for a yellow card worthy challenge; instead an ill timed handball within the 18 yard box placed the Gauchos in a dangerous position to score. And score they did.</p>\n<p>The first goal on the day came in the 19<sup>th</sup> minute of regulation time off said free kick, and it was none other than freshman forward Rodney Michael who put his team on top. Michael put his laces through the dead ball from about 10 yards out as the Gauchos celebrated their early lead.</p>\n<p>Yet, soccer is a game full of surprises as the Gauchos weren’t able to bask in this goal’s glory for very long since Sac State started to pepper back at them with attack after attack. Ultimately, it was No. 10 for the Hornets who helped find his team level at 1-1. Sac State junior midfielder Dominic Scotti belted in a well hit shot from almost 18 yards out and found himself with a lucky deflection of a Gaucho defender as the ball rolled into the back of the net. Now tied at one a piece, tensions on both sides began to simmer down and the half time whistle sounded as both teams returned to their locker rooms in order to formulate a better plan of attack.</p>\n<p>Both head coaches made the substitutions they deemed necessary in order to alter the attacking momentum, but it was to no avail. The second half of play pretty much was a defensive spectacle as both lines held their own on each side of the final thirds of the pitch. Only a combined two more shots on goal were recorded for the two teams. Soon enough, the final whistle came and the pressure was on as exhaustion began to creep in on both sides.</p>\n<p>The overtime ruling was simple; both sides would continue playing through the game clock until one side scored. Once again, the passing was present once more as the two teams chose to patiently chart out their plan of attack. But Michael only needed one more try at the goal in order to award his team with a much deserved victory. This time assisted, it was sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea who picked out an open Michael. Then, with an almost clear line of sight at the goal, he curled in his shot into the far right of the net. The team celebrations then began for UCSB as the close bout turned into three points and a well-earned victory.</p>\n<p>After this performance, Tellechea now finds himself in second place on the team’s assist category. But who’s in first you ask? Well it’s the so far undisputed team MVP: Rodney Michael. Michael now has a grand total of four assists, but most impressively he’s now recorded seven goals in his seven matches played on the season. Thus, he must now be in consideration when the league MVP talks commence later on in the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now improve to the No. 1 overall spot in the Big West conference rankings with their total of 14 points in seven matches. They’ll look to cement their position and add to their tally this weekend in a home game against the division’s second place team: UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/","id":1381,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1380,1379,1378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Anticipates Its Home Finale, Will Host UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to ride the momentum of a 2-1 win over Sac State which put them back in first place in the Big West North as it takes on UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Harder Stadium welcomes the Gauchos for the last Saturday night home game of the regular season, during which they will play the UC Davis Aggies just three games away from the start of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into this matchup fresh off a 2-1 Golden Goal victory at Sac State Wednesday and now boasts a 6-5-4 overall record.

The goalkeeper also added two more saves in the match against the Hornets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo has played outstandingly, and his six shutouts are a testament to his ability as a goalkeeper. The six clean sheets on the season for the keeper also speak to the defensive success of this team, as the Gauchos have often relied on their defense to keep them in a game in which their offense was slow to start.</p>\n<p>His 0.96 goals against average ranks first in the Big West, while his 0.75 save percentage ranks second and his 15 goals allowed ranks third.</p>\n<p>The offense has shown their strong capability to score throughout the season, particularly in a 5-2 win against Cal State Fullerton. Fellow freshman forward Randy Michael played a huge role in the Gauchos’ offensive resurgence over the last nine games, in which they’ve gone 6-1-2.</p>\n<p>Michael has scored all seven of his goals in these past nine games, including two scores against Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The seven shots in goal rank tied for second in the Big West. The California native also has four assists on the year, the best mark on the team, as well as his 18 total points.</p>\n<p>The Saturday night match presents an opportunity for the youthful squad to address the problems seen in their last matchup against Davis: defensive struggles from the keeper down through the defense and onto an offense, which could not answer Davis back after allowing each goal.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a very good shot at seeing Davis again in the postseason, and it will be better for the Gauchos to beat Davis and address the concerns now than to have to do it later on, especially when it comes to securing a possible first-round bye for the first week of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the Aggies at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 21, at Harder

Despite receiving three yellow cards against LBSU, it still resulted in a stifling defensive effort on Santa Barbara’s end.</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to continue to translate their aggressiveness to victories in their games this week against UC Davis and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The upcoming game against second-ranked UC Davis will be a great opportunity to gauge just where the Gauchos are in terms of their ability to play with the top teams in the conference. The Aggies are an anomaly at the top of the Big West. They actually have the worst overall record (4-9-1) by a large margin but have remained unbeaten (3-0-1) in conference play so far.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a tough place to play and they have got some serious momentum going being undefeated in conference so hopefully Sunday’s win was the start of something that could get us going,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The key for UCSB is going to be taking advantage of a Davis defense that has been good at times but overall very porous this year. The Aggies have given up 1.14 goals a game while scoring .71, and they have conceded nearly twice as many shots as they have taken. These stats indicate a great chance for an offensive explosion by a UCSB squad that has only been held scoreless twice this year.</p>\n<p>Another focal point for the Gauchos is going to be coming out strong in the first half, something that they really haven’t had success doing this year. Two factors that play into that are the fact that a strong opening half is vital in taking away any home field advantage, as well as the fact that UC Davis, in particular, is a very strong second-half team.</p>\n<p>Seven of the 10 goals that the Aggies have scored this year have been in the second half, and they’ve let loose 50 percent more shots in the second half than in the first. If UCSB is able to set its tempo early on in the game and maintain pressure on the Aggies’ defense, they should be in a good position to win this game.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Sunday’s matchup against Cal State Fullerton, the Gauchos will go through their toughest test yet. Although Fullerton is fifth in the Big West, it has the best overall record (9-3-3) in the conference. The Titans have been offensive juggernauts this year, averaging two goals a game and scoring three or more goals in five games this year.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Fullerton this year is senior forward Sarah Fajnor, whose offensive output ranks among the top players in the league.</p>\n<p>She comes into this game second in the Big West in goals (6) and third in assists (4) and leads her team in both categories. A big part of the Gauchos’ defensive game plan will surely be to stifle her performance and try to force another player to beat them, but that is usually easier said than done.</p>\n<p>These last two road games will make or break UCSB’s season, as the Gauchos actually have a chance to make the Big West tournament if they play well and catch a few lucky breaks in terms of other teams’ performances.</p>\n<p>There should be no lack of effort on their part in these final few games of the season, and if the Gauchos steal a couple of victories, then a conference tournament appearance will certainly be in reach.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UC Davis at 3 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 19, at the Aggie Soccer Field. The Gauchos’ season continues with its penultimate match of the year against Cal State Fullerton at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 22 at Titan Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Hornets are coming off a 2-0 loss against conference leader UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Its record may not show it, but Sac State has been able to compete at the highest level all season long, and with its amount of wins, it finds itself at third in the Big West North.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Gauchos are at a flat 1-1-1 record in conference road matches this season. Playing away from home has been an issue for UCSB, as it is 1-4-1 on the road, including the non-conference portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>Considering both teams’ history with each other, however, the Gauchos are at a very solid advantage with their all-time record versus Sac State, sitting at a favorable 13-4-3. Regardless, UCSB must not count out any of their opponents, especially due to these close standings; everyone will be pushing for a postseason spot.</p>\n<p>Some key players for Sac State are two of their best playmakers. Both are underclassmen and forwards, beginning with Hornet freshman Justin Bedig, who has been phenomenal in the creation of plays all season long.</p>\n<p>He leads his team in the assist category with a total of six assists on the year, not to mention a pair of goals to add to his name. Meanwhile, his sophomore peer, Christian Webb, also leads a statistical category as the team’s leading scorer with six goals on the year.</p>\n<p>On the Gauchos’ side, freshman forward Rodney Michael still resides as one of the team’s most valuable players as he leads in both scoring and assists, with five goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>Adding more depth to his current hot streak of performances, Michael is also second in most shots on goal in the entire Big West stat standings.</p>\n<p>We also briefly mentioned his teammate, freshman Gaucho goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, last week when he won the Big West “Defensive Player of the Week” award. Including last week’s 0-0 tie to Cal Poly, Carrillo continues his impressive entrance to college soccer with now two clean sheets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo also impressively leads the entire Big West in goals against average with a 0.96 percentage and is currently marked as second in total save percentage with a .754. Of course, part of Carrillo’s success can be attributed to the formidable defensive line he leads in front of the goal, but nonetheless, the Gauchos have been able to get the job done and will look to close out strong come Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The Sac State game will truly be a test of Santa Barbara’s endurance, as it will be a mid-season divisional matchup with much on the line.</p>\n<p>Both sides bolster a young productive roster and will want to get those three coveted points that will bring them that much closer to a playoff selection seed.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos visit the Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 18. Kickoff commences at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79173\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79173\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/","id":1379,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1378,1377,1376],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Part One of Blue-Green Rivalry Ends in a Draw","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Harder Stadium was rocking as the UCSB men's soccer team hosted its longtime rival Cal Poly Saturday night.

The conclusion of regulation play left the match scoreless, forcing the third double overtime match in the month of October for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was able to pose another goal scoring threat yet again in the first OT period, sending a free kick ball into the box that was headed on target, but Carrillo was able to strike it down. The ball was then sent off the left post on a shot off of the save which Carrillo promptly got on top of.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos just could not find the offensive rhythm that they had in their victories earlier in conference play. The defensive play from UCSB was also concerning as from the start of the second half in regulation, Cal Poly was able to take control and create their own chances for shots on goal. The shaky defense from the Gauchos forced their keeper Carrillo to stand on his head throughout the match, keeping the team within range to win the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we were only able to break once and within five seconds there five players on top of us,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The rest of the time our center backs are at midfield looking into ten players and knowing that if you make a bad pass then you’re open on the right and the left and that’s when Alan made those two saves.”</p>\n<p>While exciting, the Gauchos were certainly hoping for a better result from the Blue-Green rivalry as they ended the week of play with a 0-1-1 record.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s soccer team found themselves heading into this week’s play with a full head of steam. The six game unbeaten streak for the club allowed the squad to climb the conference standings early in the season, bringing the team to the top of the North division, three points ahead of UC Davis, with ten points.</p>\n<p>The position the Gauchos find themselves at the conclusion of this week’s play is now second in the North division, two points behind UC Davis, with 11 points.</p>\n<p>The team is now finding themselves in a place of adversity. After two challenging games, the Gauchos will now face the challenge of making another climb up the standings with only four games remaining in the regular season. The Gauchos don’t need to run the table, but they do need to get enough favorable results in the remaining matches to get/stay ahead of UC Davis, who are looking like a threat to UCSB’s plans of taking the conference crown.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg referenced the youth off the team saying, “We got to the top of the box and shot where we have one more pass to make and we didn’t do it. It’s young, it’s inexperience, it’s the crowd, and we just need someone who can handle the ball well.”</p>\n<p>The play from the young group of freshmen on the team, goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, forward Sahid Conteh and forward Rodney Michael, has been key to the Gaucho’s success this season.</p>\n<p>However, the team has been shutout twice in their last two games and have a three game winless streak. The addition of junior Joseph Ammer, who has been out since September 15th with an injury, can fully complete the offense and has the team waiting for his return to the pitch headed into the late season push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their next game on the road against the Sacramento State Hornets on Wednesday, Oct. 18 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/","id":1377,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1376,1375,1374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No Love Lost: Blue-Green Rivalry Hype Builds Toward Sat.

CP started out the season 0-4 before winning five straight before again becoming owners of a four-game losing streak which leads them to its 6-7 overall record.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Saturday’s game is not a must-win. However, it missed an opportunity to take a bigger lead in the conference standings with that loss to UC Davis, falling into a three-way tie for first place in the North with the Aggies and the Hornets, after they beat Cal Poly, meaning there is not much room for error with just two weeks left before tournament time.</p>\n<p>UCSB owns its Blue-Green rivalry with Cal Poly with an impressive 48-18-9 record against their fierce competitor. Normally, a record that lopsided would not give reason to support the notion this is the most impressive rivalry in college soccer, but the last few years would beg to differ.</p>\n<p>Over the last 10 years, the two squads have gone on to play some intense matches, with the record being 8-6-6 in favor of UCSB. Cal Poly is the only team to sweep the season series in the last 10 years as well, accomplishing the feat just once during the 2012-13 season. That also marks the last time CP has defeated UCSB in Harder in the past 19 years.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Santa Barbara has only won five of its ten home games over the past decade, with the last three games here at Harder Stadium ending in ties. UCSB, however, did take the victory at Cal Poly last year to win the season series.</p>\n<p>Not only has the great play helped increase the tenacity of the rivalry, but also the attendance, especially at Harder Stadium, has helped take this game to the next level.</p>\n<p>Last season’s attendance peaked at 11,424, the highest attended game in the NCAA in 2016 and in 2014, and the match reached 14, 919 fans in the Stadium, making it the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history, excluding playoffs.</p>\n<p>Getting to the game, the advantage seems to be with the home side despite the loss yesterday. Before that, the Gauchos were on fire, winning five of their last six games with their only non-win being a tie at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Before being scored on three times by Davis, freshman goalkeeper Adam Carrillo was on a roll, allowing just four goals in his previous six starts, and earning his second Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors last week for helping the Gauchos go 1-0-1.</p>\n<p>Even taking into account the three goals against the Aggies, Carrillo still holds the best goals-against average in the entire Big West at 1.05. His 40 saves rank fifth in the conference.<br>\nAnother freshman grabbing the headlines in Santa Barbara is Randy Michael. The forward has UCSB’s most consistent offensive player leading the team in goals (5), assists (4), and total points (14). His 14 points also rank fourth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Michael is also the only other Gaucho this season to win a Big West award. He won Offensive Player of the Week honors during the week of Sept. 28, after helping the Gauchos earn two victories against conference foes with two assists and two goals.</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, Michael has earned nine of his total 14 points in these important matches with three goals and three assists.</p>\n<p>In the five Big West games UCSB has played, as a team, it ranks second in goals (10), assists (11) and points (31) while also shooting the second-highest percentage (.15).</p>\n<p>One of the keys for Cal Poly to earn a victory at Harder Stadium will be importance of starting the game off fast. This season CP has been outscored in the first half of games 11-8, but have bounced back to outscore opponents in the second half 6-5.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but its defense needs to limit the Gauchos opportunities, which is something it has not done much of, as they’ve been outshot 181-119 over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will likely rely on goalkeeper Simon Boehme, whose 59 saves currently serves as the best mark in the Big West. The junior has allowed the fifth least goals in the conference, 15, and his .79 save percentage is a conference best.</p>\n<p>Boehme has also only allowed 15 goals on the season despite his team giving up the most shots. The 15 goals allowed is the fifth most in the Big West and his 1.24 goals allowed per game ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>Two players on Cal Poly’s side are tied for the team lead in goals (3). However, senior defender Adam Olsen will be sidelined during Saturday’s action due to earning a red card in Wednesday’s game.</p>\n<p>This means junior forward Sean Goode will have to try to carry the offensive flow against the Gauchos. Goode scored a goal against Sac State.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Diego Alonso will look to help his junior counterpart out as he leads the team in assists with four on the year, also tying him for the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The rekindling of rivalries is always a special time in sports, especially at the collegiate level. No matter the sport, an intense rivalry game, a roarous crowd and a great stadium are always a great recipe for a wonderful evening.

The California native has been on fire, having scored five goals and 11 points, both second-best marks on the team, over the last nine games. She scored the team’s only goal against CSUN, resulting in the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>Along with the freshman, the Gauchos will also hope for the reemergence of senior Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>The forward started the season hot with eight goals in the team’s first 10 matches of the season, but she has fallen flat over the last five game, having not scored and being held to just two assists.</p>\n<p>Defenses have definitely been heavily pressuring the Chino Hills native.</p>\n<p>Before her five-game non-scoring streak, she had kicked one through the back of the net in four consecutive outings.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Ball’s eight goals still earns her the top spot in the Big West, along with her 18 total points. She will need to be at the top of her game against a Hawaii squad that isn’t playing great but is still capable.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Rainbow Wahine played Big West best UC Irvine and lost 3-2, meaning they won’t be such an easy win if the Gauchos don’t come out firing.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will hope to rely on leading scorer Sonest Furtado. The senior forward also leads the team in points (11) and assists (3).</p>\n<p>In reality, if Hawaii hopes for an upset win over Santa Barbara, then it will need to come out strong and fast.</p>\n<p>So far this season the Rainbow Wahine outscored 8-3 in first halves and have been shut out in six of their 13 total games.</p>\n<p>The team will need to rely upon Furtado, but she will also need help from whoever can provide it on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Wahine goalkeeper Alexis Mata has been one bright spot on a defense that has given up 17 goals this season.</p>\n<p>The junior’s 60 saves rank second best in the Big West, while her 78 percent save rate ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>After Hawaii, the Gauchos come back home with a tough test against Long Beach State, a team that has bested UCSB in its last seven meetings.</p>\n<p>LBSU defeated Hawaii in its conference opener 2-0 but has since struggled, earning a tie with rival UC Irvine and being knocked off by CSUF at home, where it had only lost once this season before, 2-0.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Gauchos, whose top goal scorers rank way above the rest of the team, the Beach has scored 16 goals on the season, but no one player has scored more than three individually.</p>\n<p>In fact, only one, senior forward Tori Bolden, has three nets this season while the next five players have two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>This has played to the Beach’s advantage, as it has consistently found the back of the net in games, being shut out in just four contests this year, including a match against No. 18 California.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this week has become the most critical for UCSB.</p>\n<p>A slow start is not a killer, but if it bleeds into the middle of the season, then Santa Barbara has no hope of making the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>With three of UCSB’s key players being seniors, chances are they will try everything they can to right the ship and go out on top in their final season.<br>\nSanta Barbara takes on Hawaii at 10 p.m. PST on Thursday, Oct. 12, at Waipi’o Peninsula Soccer Stadium. It will then host LBSU at 1 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 15, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Considering that the UCSB men’s soccer team’s closest performance so far this season came last Saturday in a double overtime thriller against UC Irvine, it means the Gauchos have been continuing their fine form even on the road.</p>\n<p>This Wednesday, away at Irvine, will be Santa Barbara’s third and final matchup of their midseason road series. While currently 1-0-1 during away games, UCSB are also undefeated on the season at a 3-0-1 record. They’ll try to keep their winning ways afloat however, as they face off against a 2-1-1 UC Davis side who currently hold the third place position on the Big West league standings.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, even with the Gauchos’ impressive start, a win for UC Davis will be enough to hoist them up to the first place spot. So UCSB will be in fully competitive spirits in order to assert their conference domination even more. Expect another low scoring affair due to the Aggies lack of offense and the Gauchos on the road productivity, but quite a heated game as each side of the pitch would like to find the back of the net early on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Looking back on last Saturday’s game, a lot can be taken away from the defensive end. Specifically so, straight from the goalkeeper himself: UCSB freshman Alan Carillo. Carillo, who currently averages only a single goal allowed per game, has recently been awarded his 2<sup>nd</sup> honor as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. With a clean sheet already on record, and coming off an outstanding 8 save game versus Irvine, he is truly on fire and it’s helping pave the way for UCSB’s continued success.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos attacking third of the pitch, a clear cut MVP for the early part of the season can be found in freshman forward Rodney Michael. With already the most goals for the team (5) and the most assists as well (4), Michael has seemingly found himself to be a part of the match highlights week in and week out.</p>\n<p>A recurring trend can be spotted here considering underclassmen play has been very vital for UCSB thus far. Altogether combined, Gaucho underclassmen have notched a grand total of 14 goals and 11 assists on the year. So it’s clear to see that the men’s soccer program’s future is bright and head coach Tim Vom Steeg has done his due diligence during the offseason scouting.</p>\n<p>When analyzing UC Davis’ current team performance, praise can be given to them on the final third of the pitch. However, not much offensive productivity has been observed so far. With only 5 goals over their first 4 conference games, it can be argued that the Aggies have yet to click; it’s unlikely they’ll finally get things going come Wednesday night when they face off against an ever stout UCSB backline. UC Davis are led by junior forward Matt Baringer and senior midfielder Miguel Acevedo, whom both have 3 goals on the year and 2 assists apiece.</p>\n<p>The Aggies last game definitely didn’t go their way as they fell 2-0 to UC Riverside. In perspective, UC Riverside is dead last in Big West conference standings and the Gauchos bested them a couple weeks ago at home by a score of 3-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters this week’s matchup as the slight favorite, but this game can still go either way. The Gauchos also lead in their all time record against the Aggies by a score of 22-8-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will visit UC Davis this Wednesday, October 11 at 4 p.m. They will also host Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry this Saturday, Oct. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

However, neither side could break through as by the end of the half neither side had managed to put any offensive pressure on the other. At halftime, both teams had one shot, zero saves, and only one corner kick from UCSB.</p>\n<p>The teams were able to find their rhythm in the second half of the match with each side getting five shots off. UCSB was able to get four corner kicks as part of their efforts in making junior CSUN goalkeeper Henrik Regitnig work in the second half, forcing him to make four saves. Despite the chances on offense to score, UCSB could not put the ball in the net and the match ended at a regulation time in a draw bringing on overtime.</p>\n<p>CSUN was able to put together chances of their own in the first overtime period with three shots, which were unable to get past Gaucho keeper Alan Carrillo. Carrillo and the UCSB defense held strong in the first overtime period and were able to keep the team in the game long enough to find a chance for the team to score.</p>\n<p>That opportunity came in the second half of overtime in the 106th minute, where Gaucho freshman Rodney Michael got through two Matador defenders and played the ball to sophomore Noah Billingsley, who was able to put the ball past the CSUN keeper Regitnig from the right side of the box.</p>\n<p>The shot was good for the golden goal earning the Gauchos the win, 1-0 in 2OT, increasing their win streak to five. The UCSB defense also continued their shutout streak at the end of this game, bringing their total shutouts for the season to five. The Gauchos ended Thursday night with an overall record of 5-4-2, and 3-0 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then went south to play the University of California, Irvine Anteaters, at Anteater Stadium, Saturday night. Headed into the match, UCI had an overall record of 6-4-2 and 1-1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The second North-South division matchup of the trip began with an explosion of offense from both sides. Neither side was able to put a point on the board until the 28th minute where senior Anteater Giovanni Godoy drew a foul in the penalty box bringing senior teammate Mario Ortiz to the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>Ortiz was able to put the ball past UCSB keeper Alan Carrillo, giving the senior his third goal of the season. The offense from both sides continued as 18 shots were taken between the two teams by the end of the first half, but surprisingly it was only Ortiz’s shot which was on the board, giving UCI the lead at 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCI found themselves in their own end as UCSB was able to take possession and create some chances for good shots on goal. The Anteater defense was forced to try to stop the Gauchos as they took their own turn on the offensive end in a second half that would see nine shots taken by the away team.</p>\n<p>UCI was able to take six shots of their own in the second half and did have an opportunity to increase their lead, but Gaucho keeper Carrillo kept them out of the net earning four saves.</p>\n<p>It was in the 83rd minute where UCSB would finally get the finishing chance they needed to execute on when junior forward Jonah Adomakoh played the ball along the right wing to freshman standout Rodney Michael who sent the shot into the net for his fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The match would slowly wind down, ending in regulation at 1-1, and the Gauchos would find themselves in another OT period.</p>\n<p>The first OT period found the Anteaters with yet another helping of steady offensive play. Their closest chance came in the 95th minute on a header that went off the far post and was unable to be put away by any Anteater.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was able to hold steady throughout both overtime periods, not allowing a successful offensive outburst in the first and keeping the Anteater offense quiet in the second.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense found nothing in the OT periods and could not put ahead a second golden goal after staving off a valiant UCI offense. The match would be played to a draw at 1-1 at the end of 2OT.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played well this week in their first instances of conference road play. Earning the exciting win against CSUN and getting a draw against UC Irvine are good signs for a heavily-favored squad which is looking to get ahead early.</p>\n<p>The next match for the Gauchos will be played at Aggie Stadium as UCSB will be taking on the UC Davis Aggies on Wednesday, October 11.</p>\n<p>The next home game for the Gauchos is a surely anticipated match in the 2017 men’s soccer installment of the Blue-Green Rivalry against the Cal Poly Mustangs, which will be played at 7 PM PST on Saturday, October 14th at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79045\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79045\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/","id":1497,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1496,1495,1494],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Winless in Conference Play Following 1-1 Draw Against CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team managed to avoid its third consecutive loss with a 1-1 tie on the road at Cal State Northridge.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was able to hold on for a tie in a tough away game at Northridge on thursday. This game gave the Gauchos their first point of the conference season and bumped them up two places in the Big West to their current seventh place standing. CSU Northridge fell to sixth place in the standings as a result of the tie and are still looking for their first conference win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out with a much more offensively aggressive mindset than in their last two losses, and it paid off with a goal by freshman Christine Maurer in the 14th minute. She knocked in a perfect corner kick by midfielder Chace Schornstein to the near post, and with that they had their first lead in two games. Maurer has been on a tear for the Gauchos recently, having scored three goals in the last three games leading up to this one, and this goal put her at five for the season. That sort of offensive output from the midfield is rare, and her continued improvement has been one of the biggest positives for the team this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half was mostly back and forth, however the Gauchos were able to continue to attack and get three shots on goal the remainder of the period, two of those courtesy of Maurer.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half belonged to Northridge however, as a complete shift of momentum ensued when the teams came out of the locker room. CSUN got five shots off in the first 15 minutes of play, and they eventually broke through with a goal in the 60’ minute. It was another goal by a freshman, however this time it was the Matadors’ Amy Aquino who netted it after her teammate Cynthia Sanchez beat the Gauchos goalie in a one on one situation in the box.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN continued to apply pressure on UCSB just how the Gauchos were able to do to them in the first half after their goal, yet they couldn’t create any goals off their four scoring opportunities which led the game to overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a repeat of the beginning of the game, the Gauchos worked to impose themselves on the Matadors defense during the first overtime period. Shots by both Colby Parker and Madeline Gibson didn’t find their marks however, leading to a second period of overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams had their share of opportunities in double overtime, yet UCSB almost came out with the victory in the final minute of play when junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko’s shot was saved by the goalie Jovani Mccaskill. The game ended in a tie, a result that the Gauchos can certainly live with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward to UCSB’s next matchup against Hawaii, the Gauchos have a chance to make an even higher ascent up the rankings. Although they’ve lost two games already, fouth place is only one victory away and it’s up to UCSB to beat the second to last place team in the conference to get there.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
