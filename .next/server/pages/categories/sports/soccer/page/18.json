We’ve had a good training camp, we’ve had good practices, we had some things go well in the Westmont game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think you’re ever quite ready to play Stanford in your first game no matter what your preparation is, but our schedule is built to play some of the top teams in the country and at some point, whether its first game or fifth game, we’re going to play teams like Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, Santa Barbara got its 2015 campaign off on the right foot as it took down Westmont 4-1 in the two teams’ annual preseason tune-up match. With five new starters in the lineup since the end of last season, the short amount of time that the Gauchos had in their first action together should be invaluable as they look to build chemistry prior to today’s game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Offensively we kind of got what we were looking for,” Vom Steeg said. “I think the area of importance for us is defensively. I thought that we needed to do better just in transition to our defense. Defensively I think we have quite a few things we have to do in order to get ready to play Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Stanford comes to town with high expectations for the year, boasting a No. 8 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this month. The Cardinal finished last season with a record of 13-3-3 overall and 6-1-3 in the conference, winning its first Pac-12 Title in 13 years in the process.</p>\n<p>One week after becoming conference champions, Stanford’s streak of nine unbeaten games was ended by a 1-0 loss in its first NCAA Tournament game to UC Irvine, the same team that knocked UCSB out of the Big West Tournament Semifinals. The Cardinal went 1-0-1 in its two preseason games this season, winning 2-0 against CSU Bakersfield before drawing 0-0 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos last faced Stanford on the road in September of last year. A much more inexperienced team at the time, Santa Barbara fell behind early, giving up three goals within the first 12 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Stanford is particularly a good team this year but in general, they’re just a hard team to play against,” Vom Steeg said. “I do like us going into this game a lot better than we did last year. Last year we started five freshmen, so we’re a more experienced team. The players that were on the field last year when we played at Stanford, I wouldn’t say they want revenge, but you want to play that game again after what happened to us last year.”</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy will be the focal point of UCSB’s offense once again. The junior forward led the team with ten goals last season and got off to a good start with two goals against Westmont.</p>\n<p>“We know that [sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani] and Nick are going to be two really important players for us,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a number of players who have played two full seasons, but at the same time we had five new starters against Westmont, so that’s half your team.”</p>\n<p>For a team with hopes of making noise nationally this season, today’s game will be a good test to see how ready Santa Barbara is at this early stage. The Gauchos should be ready to go without injuries keeping key players out of the lineup, as they did for significant amounts of time last season.</p>\n<p>“[Freshman defender Sam Strong] will be a really good addition to our backline. He’s a player that we need in this kind of game,” Vom Steeg said. “Everybody else is in pretty good shape. There may be a couple of changes but it’ll be close to the starting group we had against Westmont.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against Stanford is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/","id":1523,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1522,1521,1520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Determined To End Winning Drought","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos and Spartans' set for Friday showdown at Harder Stadium ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56798\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"230043448\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64591\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56798\" data-attachment-id=\"56798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=1600%2C1177&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1177\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413120587\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=888%2C653&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-56798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=310%2C228\" alt=\"Sophomore forward Amanda Ball striking for the goal.

I don’t expect that to happen in the future,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite being held scoreless in their last two defeats, the Gauchos have worked out their kinks in practice and are using their losses as motivation for their matchup against San Jose State this Friday.</p>\n<p>“One thing to take out of those losses is we didn’t score a goal in 180 minutes,” Stumpf said. “We’re facing a very good San Jose State team and this is going to be a game where we will get a few opportunities at the box. We’re looking for someone who can come up with one special moment in front of the goal.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans head into Harder Stadium with a 1-1 overall record. Although SJSU is a non-conference opponent, Stumpf believes these matches are exactly what UCSB needs in preparation for the team’s in-conference games.</p>\n<p>“We felt like getting a diverse group of coaching styles in the non-conference would help us with all the different styles we are going to see in the Big West,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>As far as players on the team, Stumpf anticipates an identity to be established in the front line, especially from sophomore forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>“Amanda has some great athleticism to her and is a very explosive player,” Stumpf said. “She’s had a couple lingering injuries that hindered her training, but we’re slowly but surely opening up her minutes and making her game fit.”</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Ball stepped up and started seven games for the Gauchos scoring two game-winning goals. She was the offensive anchor last Sunday, breaking down USF defenders and taking four of the Gauchos’ five shot attempts.</p>\n<p>Other notables include junior midfielder Sara Feder and senior forward Angelisa Cortez.</p>\n<p>Coming off a knee injury her sophomore year, Feder hit the ground running during her redshirt season starting 15 matches for the Gauchos and scoring a team-high five goals. The Colorado native earned recognition for her play by earning Honorable Mention All-Big West honors.</p>\n<p>In her final season in a blue and gold uniform, Cortez hopes her impressive play from last season can carry on to the field this year. Cortez tied for a team-high five goals and 13 points in her junior year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host its first non-conference game in Harder Stadium against San Jose State this Friday, August 28th. Tip off begins at 5 p.m. so make sure to cheer on our women’s soccer team as it hopes to earn its first victory of the 2015 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Then, in 2010, one of the greatest goalscorers of our time in former French national and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry followed in Beckham’s footsteps by leaving Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona to play for the New York Red Bulls.</p>\n<p>In more recent days, there has been an eruption of stunning moves. Coinciding with the United States’ increased fan interest in soccer (thanks for making such a great videogame, FIFA), we’ve seen American nationals Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Mix Diskerud all make the move back to home soil. Former FIFA World Player of the Year Kaká, Chelsea legend Didier Drogba, and Italy’s Sebastian Giovinco are just a few more of the big names that have joined the league in the past year.</p>\n<p>And you can’t forget Los Angeles’ very own Giovani dos Santos of the Mexican national team, who has been absolutely killing it for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Back to the game. It was evident even in pregame warm-ups who the best players on the pitch were, with Pirlo and Villa in a class all on their own. However, that didn’t stop a Galaxy side that has played together for some time from absolutely dominating the last 75 minutes.</p>\n<p>Pirlo looked like a parent playing with his kid’s youth team. Every time he touched the ball it was magnificent. He seemed to always find the right man, with one-touch passes finding their mark nearly every time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have much help, and the game quickly fell out of his and a frustrated Villa’s hands as dos Santos, Gerrard and reigning MLS MVP Robbie Keane celebrated goals for most of the second half.</p>\n<p>Still, when Pirlo was subbed out late in the second half, he received a heartwarming standing ovation from a Los Angeles crowd that was happy just to be able to witness firsthand his incredible talent. Villa capped his day off by scoring a classy, well-deserved penalty, making the final score 5-1 and improving his mark to 15 goals in 22 appearances for NYC.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the all-important question: what is it about MLS that is enticing enough for these players to make the move across the Atlantic, where the sport they’ve called football their entire lives doesn’t even go by the same name anymore?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64502\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"789174628\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64502\" data-attachment-id=\"64502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/image-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64502 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=221%2C125\" alt=\"image\" width=\"221\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Villa (right) is Spain’s all-time leading goalscorer (59 goals) / Photo courtesy of mlssoccer.com</p></div>\n<p>Well, for one, as is evidenced by Villa’s high goalscoring rate and the fact that the Galaxy have tallied four or more goals in five of their last 10 league games, the defending in MLS is not quite at the same level as it is in Europe. Aging stars who can no longer easily beat the younger, defensive studs that Europe has to offer can find solace knowing that they can still make a significant impact over here. This goes hand-in-hand with the tendencies of American crowds to be number-centric, awarding praise to those who are able to provide objective, statistical truths as to why they are the best rather than through actual observation.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is the absence of relegation in MLS. While in top leagues such as La Liga and the English Premier League teams finishing in the bottom three spots of the standings are moved down to a lower division the following season, MLS teams can simply look to rebuild and start fresh after a disappointing campaign. This takes away from the stress that players in Europe feel every year about playing for a club that might not even be in the same league they signed up for in a few months.</p>\n<p>And, despite the negative connotation America holds in many parts of the world, players who have played overseas their entire lives can get a ticket not only to live in a country as great as the U.S., but to play the sport they love and get paid top dollar doing it. Not to mention, even if a player is at an away game, he’ll still most likely receive more praise than hate – the fans are happy enough to be able to see them play at all. Also, people like being praised.</p>\n<p>The most important thing that MLS provides these players though, as Steven Gerrard has <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/07/steven-gerrard-im-leaving-liverpool-for-la-galaxy-to-win-trophies-5012612/\">made clear ever since he decided to play for LA</a>, is the chance to compete for something that matters.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever in the U.S., soccer is important. Everywhere you go, people are more interested and more knowledgeable in the sport than they ever have been. The USWNT just won the World Cup, and it made record-breaking viewership numbers in doing so. FIFA is the best-selling videogame franchise in the world of sports.</p>\n<p>The talent levels and competition, the viewership and overall interest, the amount of monetary investment, and the overall perception of MLS and U.S. soccer are all on the rise. The league just made the jump from 18 teams to 20 this past season and has plans to add at least four more franchises in the coming years.</p>\n<p>It takes money to make anything happen, especially in an underdog league. Luckily, ownership in MLS has shown an increased willingness to spend. NYCFC itself is owned by Manchester City, perhaps the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs\">highest roller</a> in the Premier League at this point.</p>\n<p>Looking at where MLS was back in 2007 – when David Beckham announced he was moving to LA – to where it is now, the future is as bright as ever. The more teams start reeling in big names and improving the level of competition, the more that soccer culture in America will only continue to rise.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Heaven” returns to Harder Stadium this Saturday as the UCSB men’s soccer team plays its opening exhibition game against Westmont, giving both the team and the fans a first look at the newly reinforced Gaucho side.</p>\n<p>“The key for the Westmont game is, number one, you want to win the game. But you also want to have your first players do the things that you’ve been working on in training,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s also the only game that you can play your younger players and get them an opportunity to see how everything feels out on the field. You hope you can do all of that in one game.”</p>\n<p>The annual season-opening matchup, which has historically been dominated by UCSB, is the Gauchos’ only tune-up game before a hosting a difficult early-season challenge against Stanford next Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“All the teams that have done well in the past at UCSB have gone out in this Westmont game and have won by six or seven goals, so obviously we’re looking to send a message in this game to our future opponents,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’re just looking to do all the right things on the field so we can get a good result and send a message to the rest of the country that we’re here to play this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its second straight successful campaign in 2014 in which it finished the regular season with a record of 10-7-3 overall and 6-2-2 in conference, good enough to secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament. Unfortunately, for the second straight year, the Gauchos fell by a final score of 3-2 in the Big West Tournament Semifinals, this time in a heartbreaker to UC Irvine, ending their hopes of making a run in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Ready to put last year behind them, the Gauchos are looking at this weekend as a welcome fresh start.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the last couple years, to be frank, it wasn’t good enough. What’s expected at UCSB is a lot better than what we’ve shown.” Backus said. “We’re looking to put this program back to where it needs to be and that’s at the top of the country. Everyone’s taken great pride in the shirt and as long as we sustain that excitement, with the level of talent that we have here, I don’t see a lot of teams being able to compete with us.”</p>\n<p>A big factor playing in UCSB’s favor this year will be the experience of its core group. Last year, the Gauchos saw a high number of underclassmen taking up a large share of the minutes on the field. While it may not have been an ideal situation at the time, the benefits from having key players receive all that play time should be clear once the season begins.</p>\n<p>“The last two years we’ve played a lot of young players, so now we see the benefit of seeing guys who have played 55-60 college games,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll certainly know more about ourselves on Saturday but I like where we are right now and I like the attitude that we have on this team.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the three most crucial of the “young players” from the last two seasons are now juniors in forward Nick DePuy, left back Ismaila Jome and midfielder Drew Murphy. DePuy made the move to forward last season and led the team with 10 goals, including six game-winners, making national headlines and earning himself the Big West Offensive Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>Jome and Murphy both shared the team lead with five assists apiece, helping earn them a spot alongside DePuy on this year’s Preseason All-Conference Team. UCSB also received seven out of eight first-place votes in the preseason coaches poll to win the Big West North Division for the third straight year.</p>\n<p>“We’re in good shape in terms of having options,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick will be a center point of our attack, but unlike last year where if he scored we usually won and if he didn’t score we usually didn’t win, we’re going to have lots of different scoring options.”</p>\n<p>Another issue which plagued Santa Barbara all last season was the impact of injuries on the team’s depth, particularly in the midfield. Halfway through the conference season, Vom Steeg was even forced to put sophomore midfielder Andy Perez, who had been redshirting the entire season, into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>However, luck has been on the Gauchos’ side thus far in the preseason in terms of their health.</p>\n<p>“I think the question mark is going to be what we do out of midfield. I think we have some flexibility,” Vom Steeg said. “Coming out of training camp we have one injury, so we have 28 players available. We’re in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kicks off the season with its annual exhibition against Westmont at 7:00 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos also added five transfers, helping to bolster their depth heading into their 2015 campaign which begins in August.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about the class.  It’s a highly rated class,” Vom Steeg said. “Unfortunately, we just don’t always know if a player is really coming until they actually show up on the first day of practice.”</p>\n<p>Of the six freshmen, Vom Steeg has already named several players who are expected to make an instant impact on the pitch, including his son, goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, forward Geoffrey Acheampong and defender Sam Strong.</p>\n<p>The younger Vom Steeg out of San Marcos High School has gotten a head start on the college game, having already enrolled at UCSB for the spring quarter and participating in the team’s offseason. While playing for his club, Real So Cal, Vom Steeg has already built an impressive résumé heading into his freshman year.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara native has played for the U.S. Men’s National Team since the U-14 level, most recently protecting the net at the U-18 level in a 5-1 win over Urawa back in February. Vom Steeg has earned recognition not only locally, but nationally, being ranked a four-star recruit, the No. 2 goalkeeping prospect in the nation and the No. 23 player overall by Top Drawer Soccer.</p>\n<p>Joining the goalkeeper with an early start at UCSB is his former teammate at both San Marcos High School and Real So Cal in defender Sam Strong. Another recent call-up to the USMNT U-23 squad, Strong was named a three-star recruit by Top Drawer Soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to be able to have players who are going to be able to help you in the fall come into school early,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>A multi-talented defender, Strong has shown an ability to play any position in the back four and is a proven weapon on the offensive side as well. He put in a total of six goals for his U-18 club team in his final season, good for second-best on a team that made the playoffs.</p>\n<p>“Any time you have a freshman that you think is going to start for you, then that’s going to be a pretty good freshman,” Vom Steeg said. “[Sam and Justin] are quality players that you expect to help the program and contribute right away.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, Geoffrey Acheampong will be a creator to watch for coming down the wing. Vom Steeg has already named the left-footed forward out of Cate School in Carpinteria a likely starter for the upcoming season, thanks in part to his play for Santa Barbara Soccer Club. As SBSC’s captain, Acheampong helped lead his team to a US Youth Soccer Cup Championship. College Soccer news has ranked him as high as No. 23 nationally in his class.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the freshman class are midfielder Evan Schwartz from Corona Del Mar High School in Newport Beach, forward Cody Gibson from Bellevue High School in Washington and midfielder Kostadin Moni out of Forest Hills Eastern High School in Illinois.</p>\n<p>Onto the transfers, sophomore Ahinga Selemani is another member of the USMNT  at the U-20 level that should provide an instant punch for the Gauchos on the offensive side. The 5’8”, 170-pound forward was named the “most high-profile transfer” of the offseason by Top Drawer Soccer, coming off a strong freshman season for Michigan that earned him a spot on the Big Ten All-Conference Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>“What we’re looking for in transfers is their experience and their ability to contribute right away,” Vom Steeg said. “The transfer players who we’ve got committed are players who we feel could step in from both a maturity standpoint and a physical standpoint and not take nine or 10 games to get up to speed at the Division I level.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder and forward Kevin Feucht, originally from Germany, will be making the move over from the University of Charleston where he was a key player in the Golden Eagles’ run to the Division II National Championship Game. The German-born Feucht put in seven goals to go along with three assists in his freshman season.</p>\n<p>The final three additions to the team include sophomore defender Adedapo Adeniyi out of the University of Mobile, midfielder Seo-In Kim from Duke and redshirt sophomore Kevin Armstrong from New Mexico.</p>\n<p>A notable departure from the team that will leave big shoes to fill at right back is graduated senior Kevin Garcia-Lopez.</p>\n<p>Also leaving the team is sophomore forward Ludwig Ahl, a key offensive contributor last season who notched four goals and four assists to give him 12 total points, good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>Despite finishing in first place, the Gauchos’ 2014 season was one that was plagued by injuries. UCSB will hope that its improved depth will allow it to make it through the 2015 season with as few bumps in the road as possible.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin their next season against national powerhouse Stanford in August.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Leading the new freshman class is attacking midfielder/outside forward Jessica Clegg.</p>\n<p>Clegg is ranked 44th nationally and 19th in the Southern California region. With 16 goals and 28 assists, this four-star recruit helped Cathedral Catholic High School to a pair of California State Championships, three CIF San Diego Selection titles and three San Diego Open Division championships.</p>\n<p>Not far behind is center midfielder and four-star recruit Maddie Gibson. Gibson is ranked 53rd nationally and is fifth in the Northern California/Hawaii region. While playing at Monte Vista High School she was named East Bay Athletic League Player of the Year in 2011-2012.</p>\n<p>“Maddie plays both attacking and holding center midfield for her club and high school teams, and that is where we see her playing for us,” Stumpf said. “She is technical, intelligent, can score goals and create with her service.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the list of incoming four-star recruits is attacking midfield/forward Mallory Hromatko and left back Ryan Kokoska. Hromatko is ranked sixth in the Northern California/Hawaii region and scored 25 goals and 24 assists while attending Monte Vista High School.</p>\n<p>Kokoska is ranked 37th in the Great Lakes region and attended Carmel High School. There she helped lead the team to four MIC championships and, as a freshman, she was part of a Carmel team that went 22-0-1 and won an Indiana State Championship.</p>\n<p>Other recruits include center back Marissa Savoldi, who is ranked 14th in the Northern California/Hawaii region, forward Lauren Williams, center back Tierney McClenahan, defensive midfield/center back Sydney Magnin, forward Jessica Parque and left back/defensive midfield Eva Buechler.</p>\n<p>Also joining the team this season will be forward Hannah Dearborn. Dearborn played a total of 24 matches while attending the University of Colorado. She attended Moorpark High School where she was selected First Team All-CIF, Team MVP and First Team All-Ventura County as a senior in 2013.</p>\n<p>“Hannah is a very dynamic forward who will bring to us the ability to stretch teams out,” Stumpf said. “If we can deliver some balls in behind opposing defenses, she is going to get on the end of it and go one-versus-one with their keepers.”</p>\n<p>Young talent will also be returning for the Gauchos with current freshman midfielder Chace Schornstein and sophomore center midfielder Sara Feder. Schornstein was named to the league’s all-freshman team last season, and Feder was on the Honorable Mention All-Big West Conference list.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page

3-2.</p>\n<p>With their first loss in nearly four weeks, the Gauchos closed out their season with a record of 10-7-3 overall and 6-2-2 in the Big West. The Anteaters improved their conference-leading record to13-5-2 overall with a 4-5-1 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We gave away the game tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “To me this game was won and lost in the first 15 to 20 minutes.

Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they just couldn’t find a way to beat UCI’s redshirt junior goalkeeper Michael Breslin, who made three outstanding saves in the half to keep his team alive.</p>\n<p>The missed opportunities came back to bite UCSB as Irvine stole the momentum going into halftime with a header off of a corner kick in the 38th minute by redshirt sophomore defender Matthew Tilley.</p>\n<p>To open up the second half, the Anteaters snatched the lead when a poor back pass by the Gauchos setup Irvine’s senior forward Cameron Iwasa on the attack. Taking on a pair of UCSB defenders, Irvine’s leader in assists set himself up for a left-footed strike to the far post, giving his team its first lead of the day at 2-1.</p>\n<p>Less than two minutes later, the Anteaters continued the trend of poor back-passing in the defensive third with a terrible pass to Breslin that was pounced on by sophomore midfielder Andy Perez. After Perez attempted to dribble around the keeper, the ball fell right to freshman midfielder Axel Mendez in the box for an easy one-time finish into the empty net, tying the game at 2-2.</p>\n<p>“Our team battled, we fought, we tied the game up, but we were never settled in the second half,” Vom Steeg said. “On one hand you want to reorganize and get into overtime. On the other hand, you want to keep pushing and it didn’t work out for us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58212\" style=\"width: 664px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"453121606\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58192\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58212\" data-attachment-id=\"58212\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/gauchos-end-season-on-wrong-side-of-back-and-forth-semifinal/m-soccer-by-eric-swenson_for-11-12-2014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?fit=1200%2C920&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415823794\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"185\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"M Soccer by Eric Swenson_for 11.12.2014-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?fit=250%2C192&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?fit=888%2C681&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58212\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014--1024x785.jpg?resize=654%2C501\" alt=\"(Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"654\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?resize=1024%2C785&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?resize=250%2C192&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>With the game seemingly heading into overtime, Irvine was finally able to break the deadlock in the 82nd minute, capitalizing on a sleeping UCSB backline.

The sophomore scored six goals in the Gauchos’ final four games to give him a team-high of 10 on the year. That stretch included consecutive braces on the road against Cal Poly and Sacramento State to give UCSB its only two conference road wins of the year.</p>\n<p>“You can’t underestimate or under-emphasize the fact that every time we’ve needed a goal, Nick scored it,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s an amazing stretch. We’ve won six conference games and Nick’s got the game-winner in five of them. We’re just hoping it becomes six out of seven.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are currently the hottest they’ve been all year, the Anteaters could not be in a more different position. UCI, which at one point was the No. 3 team in the nation, has lost four of its last six games, being outscored 9-4 during that stretch.</p>\n<p>“I like the fact that we’re playing better and we’ve got good momentum,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s kind of interesting that it’s been flipped a little bit. They’re coming in this game after having lost four out of five, and we’ve gone 4-0-1. At least in that way I feel better about this game.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played at Harder Stadium over a month ago, the Gauchos came away on top in miraculous fashion with DePuy scoring from 35-yards out with under a minute remaining, giving his team a 1-0 win. The loss was Irvine’s first of the season after starting out an outstanding 9-0-2.</p>\n<p>“I think we have to play better in this game to win. When I look at that game, I thought they controlled a lot of the first half and I thought that they had some really good opportunities in the second half to win that game,” Vom Steeg said. “We dodged some bullets in that first game, so we can’t expect to give up those same opportunities the second go around and not be punished for them.”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are powered on offense by Eduardo Calzada, who has team-highs in goals (7), assists (4), and points (18).</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the most important factor heading into this game could be the fact that it is playing at home, where it owns a record of 7-1-2 this year. After going winless in their first three conference road games, the Gauchos returned to Harder to begin their current season-high five- game unbeaten streak. Owning the No. 1 seed also gave them a first-round bye, giving the team some much needed time off.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t have to play on Saturday so this week allowed us to give the guys a couple days off and to try to heal up a little bit,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s good for us at this point in the year to have a couple days off, especially when we’ve been playing twice a week. We should be as rested as we can be, so it should mean that we have no excuses in terms of being ready to play tomorrow night.”</p>\n<p>A win tonight would make UCSB the hosts of the Big West Championship game, which would be played this Saturday against the winner of the Semifinal between UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The game with Irvine will kickoff at 7:00 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58144\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58144\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/","id":1519,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1518,1517,1516],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"DePuy Scores Game-Winning Goal to Lift Gauchos Past Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nick DePuy scored twice yesterday to continue his and UCSB's hot streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57996\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.05.2014-17.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1858530082\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57995\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57996\" data-attachment-id=\"57996\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/depuy-scores-game-winning-goal-to-lift-gauchos-past-sac-st/m-soccer-by-dustin-harris_for-11-05-2014-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.05.2014-17.jpg?fit=1200%2C993&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,993\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1414274392\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"280\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"M Soccer by Dustin Harris_for 11.05.2014-17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.05.2014-17.jpg?fit=250%2C207&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.05.2014-17.jpg?fit=888%2C735&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57996 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.05.2014-17.jpg?resize=390%2C322\" alt=\"Freshman midfielder Axel Mendez is one of many players that UCSB has leaned on this season.

Day in and day out, athletes at every level sacrifice their time, their bodies and their blood, sweat and tears in the name of something bigger.</p>\n<p>After all their hard work and determination, it’s safe to say that most of these athletes would do anything not to jeopardize their chances of making it big. Sometimes though, as was the case for midfielder Andy Perez of the UCSB men’s soccer team, things don’t always go according to plan.</p>\n<p>Coming into the 2014 season, Perez was one of a large handful of underclassmen on a very young Gaucho team that still had much to prove. After a relatively quiet freshman year in which he appeared in just nine games, the Los Altos native had some uncertainty in terms of his role coming into his sophomore season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After not seeing the field about a month into the season, Perez openly voiced his concerns to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always aspired to be a starter or a strong contributor off the bench and this year I was a little worried that maybe my game wasn’t as developed as it needed to be,” Perez said. “I went to Tim and I told him that I think we should really discuss the opportunity of me redshirting.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg agreed to Perez’s proposition, using stellar senior teammate and starting right back Kevin Garcia-Lopez, who redshirted his freshman year, as an example of how the situation could potentially benefit not only him, but the team as well.</p>\n<p>However, after Perez sat out for the first 14 games of the season with no intention of playing, the circumstances surrounding the team changed. The Gauchos had been torn apart by injuries and suspensions, resulting in a mid-season slump in which they went 0-3-1 in four-straight road games, jeopardizing their chances of even qualifying for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Then, after junior midfielder Adam Carn-Saferstein tore his MCL in practice, Vom Steeg had to make a radical decision.</p>\n<p>“We literally ran out of midfielders,” Vom Steeg said. “I called Andy into the office after practice and I said, ‘I need you to play. We’ve got five games left and I need you to start on Wednesday.’”</p>\n<p>For Perez to give up his redshirt season with just five games remaining, he would be giving up an entire year of eligibility, potentially hurting his lifelong dream of making it to the pros. The shocking request was not easy for him to hear and after telling his coach that he would think about it, he turned to friends and family for support. His father, being a former member of the San Jose Earthquakes, gave him perhaps the most important advice of all.</p>\n<p>“My dad actually played professional soccer, so he has a little more insight,” Perez said. “He told me that although it does put me in a very difficult situation, Tim is my coach. He’s the one who brought me to this school and if he needs me, then I’ve got to do what my coach says.”</p>\n<p>Finally, a conflicted Perez turned to Vom Steeg, sending him a text message asking for guidance prior to making his final decision.</p>\n<p>“His response was very, very positive, telling me that he felt like I could be the spark to help us win some games,” Perez said. “After I read that text I was just like, ‘Okay, if you believe in me then I’ll do whatever I can to help the team out.’”</p>\n<p>Perez made his first start in UCSB’s next game against Sacramento State. In a must-win situation, he felt more pressure than normal as he stepped into the Gauchos’ depleted midfield.</p>\n<p>“The whole day before, I was a little nervous because I felt like there was a lot of pressure on me to come in and make a difference early,” Perez said. “Literally, the first 15 minutes of the game I wasn’t thinking about anything else but scoring.”</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before what seemed like a scripted story began taking place. In just the 17th minute, sophomore left-winger Ismaila Jome sent in a low cross towards the six-yard box that somehow reached Perez. Fighting off a defender, he got just enough of a touch to roll the ball just past the keeper and inside the left post, giving him his first career NCAA goal.</p>\n<p>“That felt like a perfect moment for me, because I had been thinking about it the whole day before and I had doubts about whether I had made the right decision or not,” Perez said. “Right when I scored that goal, I knew that I made the right decision and I haven’t thought about it twice since then. It was probably one of the coolest moments of my life.”</p>\n<p>Since rejoining the team, Perez has started every game and the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 3-0-1. Their recent run of good form has earned them a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament and home-field advantage throughout.</p>\n<p>While Perez is not the only reason that UCSB has performed so well under pressure this year, he certainly has provided the spark that Vom Steeg saw in him. Although he has given up almost a full season on the bench that he will never get back, Perez’s sacrifice has shown everyone what it truly means to be a team player.</p>\n<p>A version of this article

Tournament and a first-round bye with this past Sunday’s win at Cal Poly, the UCSB men’s soccer team plays its final regular season game today against Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>At 9-6-3 overall, and with the best record in the conference at 5-2-2, the Gauchos enter today’s matchup knowing that it is little more than a final tune-up before they host the Big West Semi Finals next Wednesday. The Hornets, meanwhile, have surprisingly jumped over Cal Poly in the standings thanks to a timely two-game winning streak and currently own the final playoff spot in the Big West North Division. At 6-9-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, Sac State can clinch a playoff berth with a win over UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ever since their season’s longest road trip of four games ended just over two weeks ago, the Gauchos have been one of the hottest teams in the country. In their last four games alone, they have been outstanding on both sides of the ball, outscoring opponents 9-3 on their way to a 3-0-1 record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the big reasons for their recent form has been sophomore forward Nick DePuy, who was just named College Soccer News’ National Player of the Week for the second time this season after scoring three goals, including two game-winners, against UC Davis and Cal Poly this past week.</p>\n<p>DePuy also tallied a Big West single-game high of nine shots against the Aggies last Wednesday. With eight goals this year, he has at least twice as many goals as any other Gaucho and ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ludwig Ahl has also been in fine form in recent games, hooking up with DePuy for two assists in the team’s road win against Cal Poly. Totaling four goals and four assists this season, Ahl has the second most offensive points on his team with 12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sophomores Drew Murphy and Ismaila Jome have each tallied five assists on the year, putting both of them in a tie for number one in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos finally got off the mark on Sunday with their first conference road win of 2014, they can now rest easy knowing that the Big West Tournament will have to come through Harder Stadium. UCSB has been nearly unbeatable at home this season, going 7-1-2 at Harder compared to 2-4-2 in all other games.</p>\n<p>Despite Wednesday’s game with Sac State being a no-bearing game for the Gauchos, they will likely have no intentions of taking their foot off the gas pedal. The Hornets are powered offensively by senior forward Chimdum Mez, who has a team-high seven goals this season.</p>\n<p>As a team, Sac State is the hottest it has been all season, having won each of its last two games in hostile road environments. With Saturday’s remarkable overtime win over UC Davis, one of the top defenses in the nation, the Hornets tied a season-high with three goals, including two from sophomore defender Andrew Gosselin. They are also on a season-high two-game winning streak within which they have scored five goals, their most in a two-game span this year.</p>\n<p>Once UCSB finishes its season against Sac State, it

After starting conference play 2-2, UCSB finished the season on a four game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“We were really great as a team this season and we will continue to improve with time and experience since this is a younger group,” sophomore defender Sydney Fuertes said. “We came into conference strong with four straight wins, but we might have peaked a little early.”</p>\n<p>Both teams came out firing as there proved to be no shortage of goals during the Thursday night match. Cal State Fullerton jumped out to an early lead only 15 minutes into the first half after a strike from redshirt-sophomore midfielder Amanda Howard bounced off the crossbar and was rebounded by redshirt-freshman midfielder Connie Caliz, who put away the goal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would storm back however and score in the 20th minute of play to tie the game at one apiece. A beautifully placed corner kick from senior midfielder Geneve Dromensk found the foot of Fuertes who knocked the ball in the net for her first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Fullerton would score one more time before halftime to take a 2-1 advantage in the 43rd minute of play. A cross from senior midfielder Lauren Stupin dropped in to junior forward Christina Burkenroad who would finish to put the team up at the half.</p>\n<p>Following the halftime break, UCSB would score the equalizer in the 55th minute of play. Sophomore midfielder Sara Feder raced down the line to beat a host of Fullerton defenders and put up a cross that found sophomore midfielder Dakota Griggs who struck the ball into the corner of the goal.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton would soon take the lead and never look back. In the 64th minute of play, junior defender Morgan Batcheller took a free kick aimed at redshirt-sophomore defender Serena Smith-Banas who was standing right in front of the goal box. Smith-Banas would knock in the game-winning goal.</p>\n<p>Fullerton would score one more insurance goal in the 76th minute to firmly put away any hopes for a Gaucho comeback. Burkenroad raced down the middle of the field trailed by a multitude of UCSB defenders and struck the ball into the top left corner of the net.</p>\n<p>UCSB outshot Cal State Fullerton 11-3 in the match, however Fullerton held the 5-3 advantage when it came to shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Both Fullerton’s redshirt-sophomore goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart and UCSB’s junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter made one save throughout the entire game.</p>\n<p>“We played really well throughout the season and got five percent better every week, which is something we had been striving for,” Ritter said. “Some of the scores just didn’t go the way they should’ve and we lost some games that we basically dominated.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

soccer team clinched the Big West North Division yesterday, defeating Cal Poly 2-0 thanks to sophomore forward Nick DePuy’s first career brace.</p>\n<p>Picking up just their second win away from Harder Stadium all year, the Gauchos improved to 9-6-3 overall and 5-2-2 in the conference, giving them sole possession of first place in the North. With its fourth straight game without a win, a struggling Mustang side continued to hurt its chances of making the Big West Tournament, falling to 8-6-4 overall and 3-4-2 in Big West.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis can still tie UCSB’s record before the season ends this week, the Gauchos own the tiebreaker with the Aggies on intra-division goals (third tiebreaker after head-to-head record and head-to-head goal differential). This gives them some much needed home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament as well as a first round bye, marking the 12th time in the last 13 years that the team has made the tournament.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While the Gauchos outshot Cal Poly 30-10 the last time these two teams met less than two weeks ago, last night told a much different story as the Mustangs ended the game leading 13-12 in shots. It wouldn’t matter though, as UCSB’s early offensive efficiency was enough to get them the win in front of a sold out Mustang crowd.</p>\n<p>In the 7th minute of the game, freshman forward Ludwig Ahl flicked a ball into the box that found DePuy, who was able to fire a shot inside the left post to beat junior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton, who leads the Big West in saves this year by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before the Gauchos’ two offensive leaders this season produced again, as Ahl connected with DePuy in the 22nd minute to put the team up 2-0. A cross from Ahl setup DePuy for a header from about three yards out to give the Irvine native his team-leading eighth goal of the year.</p>\n<p>DePuy has been in scorching form ever since the season’s first meeting between UCSB and Cal Poly. With four goals in his last three games, he has jumped to second in the conference in goals this season; not too bad for a player who wasn’t even listed as a forward at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ best chance to score came in the form of a penalty in the 86th minute. However, UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke made a diving effort to save the attempt by junior midfielder Matt LaGrassa, improving his individual record this season to 7-3-2 and giving his team their fourth shutout this season and first on the road.</p>\n<p>While little went wrong for the Gauchos as they earned back-to-back shutouts for the first time in 2014, they did pick up one red card with sophomore forward Armand Bagramyan in the 73rd minute.</p>\n<p>Ever since coming off their worst slump of the year, going 0-3-1 on a four-game road trip, the Gauchos have been the hottest team in the conference. In its last four games, Santa Barbara is 3-0-1 and has outscored opponents 9-2 during that stretch.</p>\n<p>With its last game of the regular season on Wednesday against Sacramento State being reduced to nothing more than a final tune-up for the postseason, UCSB will now look forward to the following Wednesday when they host the Big West Semi-Finals. A record of 7-1-2 at Harder Stadium gives the Gauchos great excitement headed into the playoffs, as their hard-earned home-field advantage gives them what they feel is the best chance of any team to win the conference and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Poly needs a win and a Sacramento State loss in the final week of play in order to qualify for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The game with Sacramento State will begin at 2:00 p.m. this Wednesday at Hornet Soccer Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Poly this Sunday for a game that will have huge playoff implications for both teams.</p>\n<p>Coming off of a huge home win over UC Davis this past Wednesday, the Gauchos find themselves in great shape in the Big West. They are currently tied for first place in the North Division with the Aggies at 6-2-9 overall and 4-2-2 in the conference. The Mustangs will look to bounce back after their current three-game winless streak dropped them to third place in the North at 8-5-4 overall, 3-3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Against Cal Poly on Sunday, on that field with 10,000 people in the stands, you have to be really composed,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Nine of our players have never experienced playing at Cal Poly, so we’re going to have to hopefully play like we did [against Davis], put some things together and just find a way to go get ourselves that one road win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Things haven’t gone too smoothly for the Gauchos when they’ve played away from Harder Stadium this season, as they have gone 0-1-2 in conference road games this season. If they are going to be able to finish in first place though, they will need to find a way to win at least one of their final two on the road.</p>\n<p>“Obviously what’s critical for us is we’re not really good on the road right now,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to now try to figure out how to win on the road and we might as well learn how to do that sooner rather than later.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs, who find themselves in a less than ideal position just one point ahead of Sacramento State for the final playoff spot in the North, will be looking for revenge after they let a 2-0 lead slip away against UCSB last Saturday. After a pair of second-half goals by freshman and sophomore forwards Ludwig Ahl and Nick DePuy tied the game for the Gauchos, a game-winning goal seemed like it could come at any moment.</p>\n<p>Despite having three times as many shots as Cal Poly through two overtimes, Santa Barbara failed to find the back of the net for a third time, ending the game in a 2-2 draw.</p>\n<p>“We outshot Cal Poly 30-10 in that game, so maybe if we can put a couple of those away and fix a couple of mistakes we can come away with a win,” Vom Steeg said. “The big question mark up there is how we handle the environment. We’ll have to go into the freak show on Sunday and figure out a way to go get something up there, and that’s always an experience.”</p>\n<p>A win would certainly strengthen the Gauchos’ chances of getting first place in the division and subsequently winning home-field advantage for the tournament. Having gone undefeated at home in conference play at 4-2-2, one of their top priorities is clearly going to be earning that first seed heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“Finishing in first place means that we get a couple home games in the Big West Tournament, and that’s our best chance of winning it,” Vom Steeg said. “I like us against anybody here at Harder Stadium, so that’s really what we’re fighting for.”</p>\n<p>A vulnerable UCSB defense looked very good against Davis on Wednesday, giving the Gauchos their third shutout of the season despite pushing players up the field for most of the second half and overtime. However, this weekend UCSB will be going up against the top offense in the Big West, which leads the conference in both goals (28) and shooting percentage (.123).</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, their offensive attack will continue to be run through DePuy and sophomore Ismaila Jome down the left wing. DePuy’s team-high of six goals is good for placing fifth in the conference, while Jome’s five assists has him tied with sophomore midfielder and teammate Drew Murphy for first in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great opportunity for a young team to have to go figure out 16 to 17 games into the season whether or not we can find a way to win on the road,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we got a great result with our tie at Cal Poly last year, but we’re hoping to obviously go out there and win.”</p>\n<p>The game will begin at 5:00 p.m. this Sunday at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/","id":1544,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1543,1542,1541],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sydney Fuertes: Epitome of a Gaucho","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In her second year at UCSB, sophomore defender Sydney Fuertes has excelled on and off the field.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There seems to exist something existentially magical about standing underneath the bright lights of Harder Stadium.

She started in 15 out of 16 matches in her first season and became an integral part of a defense that tallied an incredible nine shutouts in only 19 games. This year Fuertes has continued to solidify her defensive role on the team and has started every game.</p>\n<p>“Sydney is a very intelligent and skilled soccer player,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “She plays center back, center mid, she can really do it all.”</p>\n<p>Statistics have a tendency to be read and re-read, analyzed and over-analyzed, but in the end it is the person and not the numbers that make Sydney Fuertes truly exceptional.</p>\n<p>A leader by nature, Fuertes exemplifies what it truly means to take on this role. Too often leadership is mistakenly reserved for those who promote ostentatious displays and brash words. However, the true illustration of what it means to be a leader is hidden in the repeated actions that make others want to follow in their footsteps. Day in and day out, Fuertes demonstrates this inherent quality by showing up to each practice with a grin and giving everything to the game she loves.</p>\n<p>“I believe I am a leader and I like to lead by example,” Fuertes said. “I am smart both on the field and off the field. It can be hard to juggle the social and academic aspects of your life, but you have to love what you do. If you don’t love it then why do you do it?”</p>\n<p>It is just as important to excel in the classroom as it is to excel on the field, and in this way Fuertes defines what it means to be a genuine student athlete. Majoring in pharmacology with the hopes of becoming a pharmaceutical scientist, she labors tirelessly to perfect her craft off the field.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most inspiring thing about Fuertes however, is her perseverance. A severe ankle sprain sidelined her at the end of last season, which in turn made her miss the final three games of conference play. As anybody who follows sports can tell you, an injury can hamper even the most promising career.</p>\n<p>Yet this setback did not deter Fuertes who fully recovered and was named starting defender in all 20 games so far this season. Fuertes led a defensive unit that did not allow more than three goals in a single game all season and held opponents to one or fewer goals in a game 10 times.</p>\n<p>“It was hard to watch those four games on the sideline last season and know that I couldn’t directly help the team,” Fuertes said. “I want my teammates to remember me as a leader who not only helped them on the field, but off of it as well.”</p>\n<p>Even through injury, Fuertes kept her focus on the team and motivated from afar as the squad continued their campaign. This display of selflessness in a time of such frustration reveals not only her patience and heart, but also gives the model example of what it means to be a teammate.</p>\n<p>As the clock expires on her sophomore season on the UCSB women’s soccer team, Fuertes shifts her view to the upcoming potential of the young team.</p>\n<p>She will set out to accomplish her primary goals of making the Big West Conference Tournament and appearing in the NCAA Championships. Off the field she focuses on holding the big sister role and making sure she is there for the people in her life that she most cares about.</p>\n<p>Fuertes has regularly demonstrated what it means to be a leader and the hard-working competitive spirit extends beyond the field and into the classroom.</p>\n<p>She has bounced back from injury with fervor and continually brings enthusiasm to everything she does. No matter where the future may lead her, know that Sydney Fuertes will do great things.</p>\n<p>“She is a phenomenal kid and I don’t use that word very lightly,” Stumpf said. “Every day she shows up with a bright and positive attitude and always seems to have a smile on her face. She is going to be a leader on this team for the rest of her time here.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/sydney-fuertes-epitome-of-a-gaucho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/sydney-fuertes-epitome-of-a-gaucho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/sydney-fuertes-epitome-of-a-gaucho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/sydney-fuertes-epitome-of-a-gaucho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/sydney-fuertes-epitome-of-a-gaucho/","id":1541,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1540,1539,1538],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":18,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
