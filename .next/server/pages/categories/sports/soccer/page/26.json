The team lost incredible goal scorers in Sam Garza and Luis Silva, but the Gaucho’s recruiting class was voted tenth in the nation by College Soccer News.</p>\n<p>“People won’t even notice that Silva and Garza are gone,” David said. “The new recruits are unbelievable. They blend with the team really well.”</p>\n<p>One player expected to help fill the gaps and score goals is freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, the Gatorade National High School Player of the Year for men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>“He is fast … you can’t stop him,” David said. “People don’t know what’s coming, but he’s going to cause trouble. He’s going to score goals.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Dion Acoff also joins the team after transferring from Creighton where he was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection. Acoff was named to the 2012 Preseason All- Conference Team along with David and senior defender Peter McGlynn.</p>\n<p>Also joining the midfield for the Gauchos is junior Goffin Boyoko. Boyoko transferred from Auburn University Montgomery, where he earned 2011 NAIA First Team All-American and All-Southern States Athletic Conference First Team honors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got really experienced players coming into the program, so they have a feel for college soccer,” Baiden said. “We have a deep team. There is somebody ready to step in at every position.” Returning for UCSB to aid the attack is junior forward Dom Sarle, and senior midfielders Josue Madueno and David. Both Sarle and Madueno were 2011 All- Big West players. David looks to return after missing significant time due to injury.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a group show because everyone can score goals, even our defenders,” David said. “Last year we looked to Silva; this year everyone can score.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB returns the majority of its starting lineup, including junior defender Peter Schmetz, Baiden and senior midfielder Nic Ryan. McGlynn also returns after an injury plagued season.</p>\n<p>“Our defenders are looking really good,” David said. “We have seven good defenders who could start for any DI team in the nation.”</p>\n<p>Back in the goal will be senior goalkeeper Andre Grandt, who played every minute for the Gauchos last season and tallied 1.39 goals against average and 70 saves.</p>\n<p>Season highlights for UCSB include home matches against Harvard, Stanford and No. 2 UCLA. Up next for UCSB is a road game at Loyola Marymount on Sunday, Aug. 27 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/","id":1653,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1652,1651,1650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Filling the Voids","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a No. 2 finish in conference and a trip to the third round of the NCAA playoffs last season, the UCSB men’s soccer team will add five new members to its roster this coming fall in hopes of exp...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a No. 2 finish in conference and a trip to the third round of the NCAA playoffs last season, the UCSB men’s soccer team will add five new members to its roster this coming fall in hopes of expanding on the successes of 2011.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s 2012 recruiting class is highlighted by midfielder Ema Boateng, a Ghana native who was recently named the 2011-2012 Gatorade National Boys Player of the Year.

We see him playing more on the left hand side, though we also look at him in the middle; he can beat players off the dribble, he can score goals.”</p>\n<p>Boateng will be able to immediately have an impact on a Gaucho squad that needs more legs in the midfield position after losing multiple senior leaders last season.</p>\n<p>“Ema will go a long way toward replacing a couple spots that we lose, one being (James) Kiffe on the left side and he could also potentially help to replace what (Luis) Silva did for us,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com.</p>\n<p>Savino will be joining UCSB as a freshman ready to learn from next year’s senior goalkeeper and likely starter, André Grandt. Savino’s performance on the soccer pitch during his senior year earned him All-State New Jersey, All-South Jersey All-Star and All-Burlington County awards.</p>\n<p>“With André (Grandt) being a senior and Austin (Mansker) coming off of his injury, we absolutely need another goalkeeper in our program that we feel can push the other goalies,” Vom Steeg said. “Even though Nick is young, because he is very aggressive and athletic, we feel that he is someone that will fight to get himself on the field and somebody that we can work with going forward.”</p>\n<p>In addition to two highly regarded freshman additions, the UCSB coaching staff is able to bring on senior Acoff, who scored three goals last year for the Bluejays and was No. 4 on the team in shots on goal with a .341 percentage. Acoff is a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference standout and helped Creighton to a No. 2 finish in last year’s College Cup.</p>\n<p>“He’s a dynamic, explosive player with great pace and the ability to beat you,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com. “Against us (during the 2011 NCAA Third Round), I thought he was the best player on the field and I also thought he was very good at the Final Four.”</p>\n<p>Campion comes to UCSB from Stella, France, and brings a new element of size to the Gaucho frontline. The 6’2”, 200-pound Campion tallied 17 goals and led his team with 61 shots and 33 shots on goal this past season.</p>\n<p>Joining Campion on the far half of the pitch will be Brockway, who redshirted his freshman year at Oregon State and joins the Gauchos with four years of athletic eligibility remaining. At Todd Beamer High School in Tacoma, WA, Brockway was an All-League and All-Area honoree as a senior.</p>\n<p>“With the departure of Tim Pontius to the Seattle Sounders, we are excited to have Brandon’s size, athleticism and passing ability to compliment our back line,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look forward to an exciting pre-season schedule in which they will host Westmont, Valparasio, UCLA and Harvard at home before beginning Big West Conference play. All home games will be played at Harder Stadium on the UCSB campus, with the Westmont match set as a season opener on Aug. 18 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/","id":1654,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1653,1652,1651],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"13 Freshmen To Aid Gauchos Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With 10 seniors set to graduate this spring, the UCSB women’s soccer team is in a state of flux after their 2-6 last place finish in conference this season (7-11-2 overall).

Creighton attempted 17 shots overall, including twelve attempts in the first half that yielded two goals.</p>\n<p>Both of Creighton’s goals were scored on dead-ball plays, the first a penalty against junior forward Sam Garza within the box just seven minutes into the first half. Garza’s foul call was met with frustration from the UCSB sideline and allowed Creighton’s Bruno Castro to put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on the PK.</p>\n<p>“It was about the worst way to start a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We were very confused as to what the call even was. He had told Sam Garza not to hold [Creighton’s Ethan Finlay] and Sam said he was not holding him, but obviously referee saw differently.”</p>\n<p>A second goal came just ten minutes later when Andrew Ribeiro was able to connect on a corner kick play. Ribeiro’s low strike on the ground after a deflection was made amidst a swarm of blue and white jerseys, and crept past junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt to push the Blue Jay lead to 2-0, a margin that UCSB was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>“It was really tough coming back from two goals down early on,” Sarle said. “We had a chance in the last ten minutes but it’s always tough going down two like that. Especially against Creighton who has only given up a handful of goals all year.”</p>\n<p>The game was physical throughout the 90-minute stretch. Questionable calls toward the end of regulation were met with furious reactions from the UCSB sideline, including the ejection of assistant coach Greg Curry with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The ejection came after Curry’s reaction toward a yellow-card call against senior midfielder Luis Silva that sent a Creighton player to the ground in front of the UCSB bench. Two yellow cards were issued to Creighton, while three were given to UCSB. The Gauchos also received two red cards, both with under five minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Grandt had arguably his best performance of the year with a season-high eight saves throughout the match.

Just six minutes into the match, a through ball by Madueno was met with a powerful kick by Silva, giving UCSB the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was ripped,” Vom Steeg said about Silva’s goal. “Silva was not only great but was on a different level on the field tonight.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s shot from 12 yards out added to his total of 17 goals on the year. At the end of Big West conference play, Silva ranked No. 6 in the nation in goals scored, and ranks No. 12 overall in goals per game with .80 as of Nov. 13.</p>\n<p>Madueno was able to add his name to the shot list at the 40:14 mark, when he received a pass on the left side of the box from sophomore forward Dom Sarle, who is currently second on the team in total assists with nine.</p>\n<p>“Josue was a real important key to the game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “They couldn’t stay with his pace and athleticism.”</p>\n<p>Down 2-0 coming out of the halftime break, Providence was able to respond with a goal by freshman defender Brandon Adler 22 minutes into the second period. The goal came on a corner kick set and was Adler’s first of the year.</p>\n<p>“I made a curving run toward the back post and made a header,” Adler said. “One of their players tried to clear it off the line but thankfully it went over.”</p>\n<p>Less than five minutes later, Sarle was able to score on a through ball from Silva, who tallied his team-leading 10th assist of the year.</p>\n<p>“I beat [the defender] around the corner quick,” Sarle said. “He cheated near post and I slipped it by him.”</p>\n<p>Providence was able to draw a foul call within the box during the 83rd minute, allowing Anthony Baumann to deliver a penalty kick to the lower left side of the goal. The strike brought the Gaucho lead down to 3-2, where it would remain for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“We lost to a good team,” Providence Head Coach Chaka Daley said. “The way we played in the second half … we should have played that way in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot the Friars 8-1 in the first half and 16-6 throughout the game. Providence goalkeeper Jhojan Obando recorded seven total saves during the match, and UCSB junior goalie Andre Grandt tallied two stops.</p>\n<p>UCSB advances to the third round of the tournament against Creighton next Sunday, Nov. 27.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43159\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43159\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/","id":1649,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1648,1647,1646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Friars in NCAA Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB men’s soccer will face an unfamiliar foe Sunday night when Providence College comes to town for a second-round match of the NCAA tournament.

The New York native has seen action in all 21 of UCSB’s games this year, and his eight assists on the season ranks No. 2 overall on the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had a rocky start to Big West conference play with just a 2-4 record to open the season. A five-game winning streak to close out the regular season allowed the Gauchos to compete in the Big West tournament for the fourth consecutive year. A win against UC Davis in the semifinal match of the tournament allowed the Gauchos to face UC Irvine in the championship, where they were defeated on the road 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva, who had a goal and an assist in the losing effort against UCI, currently leads the league in goals scored with 16 and goals per game with .80. Silva was named the Big West conference midfielder of the year, adding to a growing list of awards that includes numerous player of the week honors, as well as all-Big West honors for the third straight season. Silva is joined on the All-Big West list by junior forward Sam Garza, senior defender Tim Pontius and senior midfielder James Kiffe, who was also recognized as Big West conference defender of the year.</p>\n<p>“We always had players that could score goals for us,” Sarle said. “It helps getting recognize but we knew that all along so hopefully we can keep it up.”</p>\n<p>Providence College saw success during the early part of its season with a five-game winning streak, and was able to clinch a berth in the Big East tournament by finishing among the top six teams in the conference. The Friars lost in the first round of the conference tournament by a score of 5-0 to a Louisville team that had lost last year’s NCAA championship match against Akron University.</p>\n<p>Providence ranks No. 15 out of 16 in the conference in shots (193) and No. 9 in the conference in goals per game with 1.39, similar in number to the amount of goals per game allowed by UCSB, which stands at 1.38. Sophomore forward Greg Davis and freshman midfielder Marcos Ugarte each lead the Friars in goals with six apiece. Ugarte, along with junior midfielder Marc Cintron, received all-Big East honors this season.</p>\n<p>There are stark contrasts in each team’s offensive capabilities. While UCSB has taken a total of 340 shots on the season, Providence has tallied just 193 attempts. However both teams are fairly even in shooting percentage; Providence holds a .130 success rate and the Gauchos manage to score on .138 of their shots.</p>\n<p>The teams are almost as equally matched in the shots-on-goal category. Providence scores on .461 of its shots on frame, while UCSB is able to score at a .435 rate of shots on goal. Gaucho junior goalkeeper André Grandt has amassed 60 saves thus far this season, rivaled by 56 total saves by Providence goalie Jhojan Obando.</p>\n<p>Should Sunday’s match be stretched to overtime, both teams will compete with experience in extra minutes. Providence is undefeated in overtime matches this season, with a 1-0 win coming against Rhode Island and a 1-1 double OT tie against USF, while UCSB is 4-1-1 in overtime matches this year.</p>\n<p>“When we get chances we have to finish them early, Sarle said. “We know what we have to do when we get tight games [because] we’ve learned from this year, NCAA games are going to [be decided by] one or two goals … There will be close games.”</p>\n<p>The winner of Sunday’s game will move on to the third round to face the winner of Northern Illinois vs. No. 2 Creighton. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. on Sunday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/","id":1646,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1645,1644,1643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Championship vs. UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A muddy night in Irvine seemed even colder for the UCSB men’s soccer team when it was defeated 3-2 in double overtime during the Big West Championship match on Saturday night.

UCSB is also likely to gain a high seeding in the NCAA tournament brackets, in large part due to a preseason schedule that yielded victories against Duke (Sept. 2) and Akron (Oct. 5).</p>\n<p>The poor field conditions only worsened as the minutes progressed throughout the game, transforming the once-green pitch into a muddy landscape of potholes and divots.</p>\n<p>“The quality of the surface on the field was not great,” Vom Steeg said. “We played Garza and on his first touch [the ball] bounced up and took away a scoring opportunity for us.”</p>\n<p>UCI was able to get off eight shots during the first half, compared to just four for UCSB, and took a 1-0 lead going into the break. UCSB responded in the 64th minute when physical play inside the goal box led to a penalty kick by Silva, who has scored on two of his three attempts this year.</p>\n<p>“Silva is the best player in the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “He played that way in the biggest game of the year. In my opinion, he’s the offensive MVP of the conference.”</p>\n<p>Silva added to his offensive attack less than five minutes later on a free kick from 23 yards outside of the box. A streaking sophomore forward Dom Sarle was able to corral the ball and touch it into the goal, giving UCSB a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Irvine had multiple opportunities in the second half to tie the score that were interrupted by the play of junior goalkeeper André Grandt. A breakaway by the UC Irvine offense forced Grandt into a one-on-one situation, where he was able to make the save.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Grandt again made an influential play for the UCSB defense during a UCI free kick.</p>\n<p>“The shot was right on me and I got both hands on the ball,” Grandt said. “Next thing I know, 3-4 [Irvine] players were all sliding into me. I had both my hands on the ball so it was called a foul.”</p>\n<p>An Irvine throw-in with just two minutes remaining in regulation made its way to the front of the UCSB goal box, where it was successfully headed in by the Anteater offense. The 2-2 tie pushed the game into double overtime where UCI was able to score off of a rebounded shot and win the tournament championship.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/","id":1648,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1647,1646,1645],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Advance to Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Junior forward Sam Garza’s goal and assist helped the Gauchos overcome visiting UC Davis 2-1 during a semifinal match of the Big West conference tournament Wednesday night.

Freshman Marshall Cazares took over the role for his fifth start of the season.</p>\n<p>“Defensively, he did very well,” Vom Steeg said about Cazares. “He defended very well tonight.”</p>\n<p>A win by UC Irvine over UC Riverside the same night determined the Gauchos’ competition for the Big West championship. It will be the third straight year that UCSB will play in the Big West championship, and the first time the team will play at Irvine this season.</p>\n<p>The last match featuring the two teams ended in a 2-0 Anteater win at UCSB. The Gauchos held a 12-11 advantage in shots taken during that game with five on-goal attempts compared to four by UCI.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and UCI share the top-two standings in multiple stat categories for the Big West conference. UCSB stands at No. 1 in points, goals and goals per game, with UC Irvine ranked No. 2 in each. UCI rankes No. 1 overall in shots and shut-outs.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos will make the NCAA tournament regardless of Saturday’s outcome, a win against Irvine provides the possibility for better seeding in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a position now where we’re finding ways to win,” Vom Steeg said. ”Without a doubt we’ll be a top-eight seed if we can beat Irvine.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s championship match is scheduled for 7 p.m. at UC Irvine.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/gauchos-advance-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/gauchos-advance-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/gauchos-advance-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/gauchos-advance-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/gauchos-advance-championship/","id":1644,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1643,1642,1641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Seeded Gauchos Set to Kick Off 2010 Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team, currently ranked No. 2 in the league, will find itself in a familiar postseason position tonight when it hosts UC Davis in a Big West tournament semifinal match.

During that game, UCSB out-shot the Aggies 21-12, including a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“We have a high-powered offense,” junior forward Michael Nonni said. “We generate so many chances, it’s ridiculous. If we can put some away in the first half we can play more defensive [in the second half].”</p>\n<p>Davis countered with a goal during the second half, forcing the game to enter extra minutes. Junior forward Sam Garza was able to connect on the game-winning goal in overtime.</p>\n<p>“In overtime what we’ve done all season long is have certain players on our team that are playmakers do something special to win the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We made sure one of those players had the ball.”</p>\n<p>Eleven of UCD’s 18 games this season have gone into extra time. UCSB holds an undefeated 4-0-1 record in overtime this year, while UC Davis has compiled a 4-3-4 mark during extra minutes, including the loss to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Three weeks after the OT win, UCD traveled to Harder Stadium to play the second league match against UCSB. The game ended with a 3-1 Gaucho victory in which Vom Steeg’s offense again held the advantage in shots taken (12-6) and shots on goal (4-2). Two of UCSB’s three goals were scored by senior defender Tim Pontius, including a 61-yard shot from behind the midfield line.</p>\n<p>“We moved the ball well,” Nonni said. “Most of our goals are gonna come off passing, moving and getting behind the defense.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis ended its final two games of the regular season in double overtime 1-1 ties against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. The Aggies have had a strong showing on the road during conference play, with wins coming against Cal Poly, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine during the regular season.</p>\n<p>“They are dangerous on set pieces and counter-attacks,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can transition well and make sure we win the battle of the 18-yard box, I think we can keep them from scoring.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently 8-2-1 at home this season, and has compiled a 16-4-4 overall record against UC Davis. UCD last beat the Gauchos during a regular season game in 2008.</p>\n<p>The winner of tonight’s game will move on to the Big West championship. A match between league-ranked No. 1 UC Irvine and league-ranked No. 4 UC Riverside will determine the opponent for tonight’s victor.</p>\n<p>A two-day break over the weekend was a much needed period of rest for a team that has been subject to injury throughout the season and has played four games through the past 10 days.</p>\n<p>“We were able to gives guys Saturday and Sunday off,” Vom Steeg said. “We got some of our legs back. We should be a fresh team come Wednesday night.”</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva will start tonight’s game as the league leader in goals scored with 15 total on the season. Silva and junior forward Dom Sarle are each tied for first in the Big West in assists with eight apiece.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

Key slide tackles and a defensive effort from senior Tim Pontius poised the back line against the Mustang offense, which upset UCSB 2-1 in the previous match between the teams.</p>\n<p>“[Tim] played like a senior tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “Our defense challenged them to get the shut-out.”</p>\n<p>Midfielder Luis Silva was the only senior to score on his night of celebration, adding to his league-leading tally of 15 goals on the season. Assisted by junior forward Dom Sarle, Silva slipped past the defense to score with just 12:38 remaining</p>\n<p>“I sprinted right behind the centerback,” Silva said. “And [Sarle] played me a nice ball; he timed it right. I took a touch around the goalkeeper and put it away.”</p>\n<p>UCSB held a 19-11 advantage in shots taken, including 10 on goal, compared to just one for the Mustangs. With the victory, UCSB’s home win streak against Cal Poly stretches to 14 games dating back to November 1998.</p>\n<p>A pre-game celebration honored the individual careers of five senior members of the squad — Pontius, midfielder Gaby Okito, forward Waid Ibrahim, midfielder James Kiffe and Silva.</p>\n<p>A UC Davis tie against UC Riverside on Saturday allowed UCSB to draw a No. 2 seed in the Big West tournament. The Gauchos will host No. 3 UCD at home on Wednesday for the first semifinal game of the tournament. No. 1 UC Irvine and No. 4 Riverside will face each other in the other semifinal game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-07/gauchos-shut-mustangs-senior-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-07/gauchos-shut-mustangs-senior-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-07/gauchos-shut-mustangs-senior-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-07/gauchos-shut-mustangs-senior-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-07/gauchos-shut-mustangs-senior-night/","id":1665,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1664,1663,1662],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Rival Mustangs at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A rivalry will be renewed tonight when Gaucho blue meets Mustang green on the brightly lit field beneath the bleachers of Harder Stadium.

UCSB (12-5-1 overall, 5-4 in conference) currently ranks No. 3 in the Big West behind No. 1 UC Irvine and No. 2 UC Davis, and is trailed by No. 4 UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Entering the match, UCSB’s offense leads the league in five major statistical categories, including goals (41), goals per game (2.28), assists (35), assists per game (1.94) and overall points (117). The Gauchos are also ranked No. 6 in the nation in total goals scored.</p>\n<p>“We’ve scored 10 goals in three games,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “At this stage in the year we know our best defense may be our offense.”</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva has been an important asset for the Gaucho offensive attack. His seven conference-game goals currently rank him at No. 1 in the league, and his game-winning shot against Cal State Northridge earlier this week secured UCSB’s place in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>“To say he’s been playing well is an understatement,” Vom Steeg said. “Because of the number of injuries we’ve had we have to have a few players step up, and Luis Silva has done exceptional.”</p>\n<p>Injuries have plagued the UCSB squad throughout the season. Junior midfielder Machael David, sophomore defender Matthew Glodack, sophomore midfielder Fifi Baiden and junior midfielder Josue Madueno have all been forced to either miss a game or leave the field for the remainder of a match during this season due to injury.</p>\n<p>With the loss of certain key players in the Gaucho lineup, others have been able to fill the void. A notable player that has stepped into the role left behind due to injuries is freshman defender Marshall Cazeres, who has started and played throughout all of the last three games for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a freshman, it’s not easy to come into a team in the situation we’re in,” Kiffe said. “But he’s done really well. Marshall has been huge.”</p>\n<p>Playing alongside Cazeres on the UCSB back line is senior defender Tim Pontius, whose last performance at Harder Stadium resulted in a two-goal outing, including a 61-yard score from across the midfield line.</p>\n<p>Pontius and junior goalkeeper André Grandt, who has amassed six shutouts on the season, will lead the Gaucho defense against a Cal Poly attack that ranks last in the Big West in total goals and goals per game, yet was able to outscore UCSB 2-1 on the last meeting between the teams.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be physical; we can’t let them through easily,” Pontius said. “We have to be aware of where their guys are on the field at all times.”</p>\n<p>Six of the last nine matches between UCSB and Cal Poly have gone into extra time. The Gauchos currently hold an undefeated 4-0-1 overtime record this year, while the Mustangs have been unable to pull off a victory in the three OT matches they’ve played this season.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against the Mustangs has drawn heavy publicity over the past week. Fox Soccer Channel will be broadcasting the game live on national television. Woodstock’s Pizza has offered a free one-slice coupon to each student if Harder Stadium is filled to capacity, a feat the Mustang student fanbase was able to achieve three weeks ago to the day when the then-No. 18 Gauchos were upset on the road at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“Our team had to listen to 11,000 Cal Poly fans,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re really hoping that Cal Poly is going to have to listen to 16,000 of our fans.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-04/gauchos-face-rival-mustangs-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-04/gauchos-face-rival-mustangs-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-04/gauchos-face-rival-mustangs-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-04/gauchos-face-rival-mustangs-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-04/gauchos-face-rival-mustangs-home/","id":1662,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1661,1660,1659],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Double OT Thriller","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It took a game-winning goal by senior midfielder Luis Silva with 19 seconds left in double overtime for the UCSB men’s soccer team to finish off Cal State Northridge 3-2 on the road Tuesday night.

With the loss, the Mustangs drop to 3-5-1 in the Big West and remain out of reach for a top-four finish in the league.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck first during the match on a goal by junior midfielder Josue Madueno during the 16th minute, assisted by junior forward Sam Garza.</p>\n<p>“Josue made a run out of midfield behind the defenders,” Vom Steeg said. “Garza slipped the ball into him and Josue lifted the ball over the goalie.”</p>\n<p>Northridge was able to counter during the 43rd minute, tying the game 1-1 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Silva was able to tie the game during the 76th minute on a free kick from 45 yards out. The score to the left side of the goal gave UCSB a 2-1 lead that would hold until the final minutes of regulation.</p>\n<p>A goal by Northridge freshman midfielder Yarden Azulay during the 88th minute gave the Matadors a chance to win in overtime, only to be beaten by Silva’s shot in the 109th minute.</p>\n<p>UCSB outshot the Northridge offense 26 to 14, and also had the advantage in shots on goal with 11 compared to CSUN’s seven. The 26 shot attempts is a team-high for the season. As usual with must-win games, Tuesday’s match was a physical one. UCSB was called for 24 fouls while Northridge fouled 19 times throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt followed up a 6-save performance this past weekend against Cal State Fullerton with a 5-save outing Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Madueno and sophomore midfielder Fifi Baiden both left the game before the end of regulation because of injuries and their statuses for Friday’s match are uncertain.</p>\n<p>“Losing those two players meant we had to go deep into our bench,” Vom Steeg said. “As a result we needed someone like Silva to figure what we needed [to win]. And he did.”</p>\n<p>Game officials plan to review the footage of the game-winning goal, and a decision as to goal credit is currently pending. If Silva is credited with the goal, he will have tallied a league-leading 15 goals on the season, placing him among the top ten goal-scorers in men’s Division one college soccer.</p>\n<p>The victory over Northridge moves UCSB into a tie with UC Davis for second place in the Big West. UC Irvine currently sits atop the league standings with a 6-3-1 conference record and 19 total points.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home this Friday at 7 p.m. to take on Cal Poly during senior night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/gauchos-win-double-ot-thriller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/gauchos-win-double-ot-thriller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/gauchos-win-double-ot-thriller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/gauchos-win-double-ot-thriller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/gauchos-win-double-ot-thriller/","id":1679,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1678,1677,1676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Face CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Team buses will be gassed up for the final road trip of the season today as the UCSB men’s soccer team heads south to face Cal State Northridge.

The Matadors are first in league in shutouts with eight total this season, and are ranked No. 2 overall in goals allowed with 1.06 scores per game. CSUN also ranks No. 2 in shots per game, averaging an even 16 attempts per match. UCSB falls just short with 15.76 shots per match.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior midfielder Luis Silva leads the league in goals scored with 13 total on the season. Silva was recently awarded multiple honors for his performances of late, including Big West Offensive Player of the Week and a part of the College Soccer News National Team of the Week.</p>\n<p>“He puts himself in situations where he gets chances [to score],” junior defender Peter Schmetz said. “He’s a good goalscorer and we need goals to win a game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match will be the final home game for Cal State Northridge. The senior celebration night will add to the already harsh circumstances of playing on the road for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re used to playing in front of a big crowd,” Schmetz said. “I don’t care if it’s their senior day or not.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West tournament quickly approaching, every conference team is entering the final stretch of the season. UCSB must keep its top-four ranking in league play in order to qualify for the postseason Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Though Santa Barbara’s chances of making the tournament are good regardless of the team’s finish in the Big West, its NCAA tournament standing could be greatly improved should the squad do well over the course of the final two conference games, beginning with tonight’s match at Northridge.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. tonight at Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42444\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42444\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/gauchos-travel-face-csun/","id":1677,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1676,1675,1674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Seniors Get One Final Rivalry Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s soccer team was able to end a tiresome season in strong fashion with a 2-1 victory over rival Cal Poly on senior night this past Friday.

Cal Poly had multiple opportunities to tie the game in the remaining minutes, but the Gaucho defense held strong for the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was so rewarding to have all their efforts finally rewarded,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It’s just an absolute dream that they get the result against our local rivals, their last game of their career at home.”</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Kat Serdio contributed to the win in the first half, making her first start of the season. Serdio held Cal Poly scoreless in the first half, making numerous plays, including a phenomenal one-handed diving save with just under a minute left in the first half.</p>\n<p>“It changes the game for sure,” Stumpf said. “She is a great shot-stopper. It was a tough save and she got completely horizontal — one-handed save to parry it wide.”</p>\n<p>Benjamin noted that the team made a mental adjustment to enter the second half and it showed immediately.</p>\n<p>“I think to just kind of calm ourselves down,” Benjamin said. “To just really know that we can play and just have fun playing the way we play and not the way the other team does.”</p>\n<p>Although their final year was not as successful as their previous three, the UCSB seniors will still go out as winners. As freshman and sophomores, they made consecutive appearances in the NCAA tournament having won the Big West.</p>\n<p>“No one is satisfied with the season they had,” Stumpf said. “But when they get away from this season a little bit and they look back at their careers, my hope is that they will be very satisfied and pleased with their book of work in total. Not many people can say they’ve been to the NCAA tournament and even fewer can say that they made it two out of four years.”</p>\n<p>This year’s senior class can go off happy knowing it competed in every match and left UCSB with one final great memory with a victory against their rivals. Roby summed it up best.</p>\n<p>“We don’t like Cal Poly so this was great,” Roby said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-31/seniors-final-rivalry-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-31/seniors-final-rivalry-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-31/seniors-final-rivalry-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-31/seniors-final-rivalry-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-31/seniors-final-rivalry-win/","id":1675,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1674,1673,1672],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":26,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
