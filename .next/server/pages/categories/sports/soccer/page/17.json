Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The UCSB men’s soccer team got off to a dream start to its Big West campaign this past weekend, going a perfect 2-0 thanks to three more goals from its nearly unstoppable forward Nick DePuy. After the Gauchos defeated UC Irvine 3-1 on Thursday to open up conference play, the scorching hot junior put away both goals in a 2-1 overtime win against CSUN on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Santa Barbara now owns the Big West’s best overall record at 7-3-1 and 2-0 in conference play. The Anteaters ended the weekend with a 1-1 tie against Cal Poly to move to 2-6-3 overall and 0-1-1 in the conference. Northridge lost both of its games over the weekend to fall to 4-5-1 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">While conference road games were a huge issue for the Gauchos in 2014, the boys in blue seem to have found answers with more experience. Dating back to last year, UCSB has now won four straight on the road in the Big West and is undefeated in its last seven conference matches overall, not including the postseason. This is a huge turnaround from the start of conference play last season, when Santa Barbara went winless in its first four games away from home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">While the Gauchos did much of their damage against Irvine early in the first half, the game against Northridge took nearly 100 minutes of play before DePuy was able to put it away with a walk-off winner. Moments before the goal, DePuy flicked a ball into the box to find junior midfielder Seo-In Kim who was able to cut inside and get a shot off on target.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">As he was for most of the game, Matador senior goalkeeper Adam Hobbs was in position to make the save, sending the ball towards UCSB’s Ahinga Selemani. The sophomore forward’s rebound attempt hit the right post, falling right back to DePuy in the six-yard box where he struck in his fifth game-winning goal of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">It’s been quite a year already for DePuy, who has now scored in three consecutive games. The former midfielder leads the Big West with 10 scores through 11 games, three more than anyone else in the conference. His five game-winners are good for a top-5 ranking in the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Although UCSB dominated in the shot department, outshooting CSUN 18-5, Hobbs’ season-best 10 saves kept the Matadors in the game until late. The only other shot that got past the senior was the game’s opening goal, which DePuy headed past him in the 38<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute thanks to a good cross from junior midfielder Andy Perez. DePuy had seven shots to his name for the day, including six on frame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos seemed to be heading into the half up 1-0, but Northridge’s sophomore forward Dean Wright found an equalizer with just 1:59 left before the break. Redshirt freshman midfielder Bradley Mulvey and sophomore forward Jeremy Degraffenreidt picked up their first career assists after a through ball from Mulvey set up Wright for the game-tying shot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">However, it wasn’t enough for the Matadors, who for the second straight time hosting the Gauchos lost 2-1 due to an overtime game-winner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The win was UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s 99<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> career Big West victory. He needs just one more to become the conference’s first coach ever to reach 100 wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In Thursday’s win over the Anteaters, despite conceding less than three minutes into the game, the Gauchos answered back quickly to take control on their way to the 3-1 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">A pretty pass from senior midfielder Gerardo Gonzalez gave senior midfielder Eduardo Calzada the opportunity to chip UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, putting the Anteaters up 1-0. </span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB answered back quickly, scoring in lucky fashion just seven minutes later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After finding space down the left wing, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong sent in a cross that ended up in the back of the net to tie the game at one goal apiece. </span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Less than two minutes passed before DePuy put away a shot passed Irvine’s redshirt senior goalkeeper Michael Breslin to make it 2-1, thanks to a perfect through ball from sophomore left back Randy Mendoza.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Vom Steeg made four saves on the night, but perhaps none was better than the one he made in the 20<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute on a shot by senior midfielder Mats Bjurman, coming off his line to make a fine stop and conserve the Gauchos’ slim advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos held on to their one-goal lead all the way until the 86<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute, when junior midfielder Josue Espana came up with a takeaway deep in Irvine territory before beating Breslin inside the penalty area. With the 3-1 victory, UCSB has now come away with a win in its last four Big West openers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Through one weekend of conference play, Northridge and Irvine join Sacramento St. as the only winless teams in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB returns home this week for games against UC Riverside on Thursday and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65018\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65018\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/","id":1509,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1508,1507,1506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Opens Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Following a controlled 1-0 victory against Pacific, the UCSB women’s soccer team tops off their first Big West match of the year with a one-game road trip to 3-6-1 University of Hawaii.

Despite a rough start to last season Stumpf is very optimistic for this young team along with valuable veterans such as Amanda Ball and Savannah Francis coming back into the lineup.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s going to be nice to have a deeper bench and more experience in our group specifically from Amanda and Savannah, Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Ball and Francis will be a tremendous boost to Santa Barbara’s already-sharp rotation. As a freshman, Ball started seven matches at forward for her team racking up two goals in her first two home appearances against Cleveland State and Southern Utah. Adding some well needed offensive experience, Ball will mesh well in that front line with freshman forward Mallory Hromatko and junior midfielder Sara Feder. Ball has not seen action since UCSB’s double-OT tie against San Jose State on August 28th.</p>\n<p>Heading into her senior year, Savannah Francis will likely be a primary leader both on offense and defense for UCSB. The La Mirada, CA native was on the field in all 19 matches for her team, starting 16 of them. Francis finished the season with two goals and one assist, ironically being Amanda Ball’s first career goal against the Vikings. A gruesome foot injury has sidelined Francis for 13 games this season.</p>\n<p>“These players coming back will likely see some minutes off the bench [this Thursday],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have some assignments to be aware of as they face a Rainbow Wahine team coming off a 2-0 victory at home against Brigham Young University. Sophomore Dani Crawford looks to carry the load for Hawaii leading the team with three goals and six points at the forward position. This will be a big matchup for defenders Ryan Kokoska and Sydney Fuertes to slow Crawford down and lower her scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Stumpf is not only optimistic in his team’s play this weekend but also how Rainbow Wahine Stadium will fit their mode of play.</p>\n<p>“[Rainbow Wahine Stadium] is quite nice. It’s big, flat, fast, and suits the style of soccer we want to play,” said Stumpf.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to the big island this Thursday for a 10 p.m. pacific time match against Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 1, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/","id":1505,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1504,1503,1502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Opening Weekend: Time For Business","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite clinching No. 1 seeds and first-round byes in the Big West Tournament the past two seasons, the UCSB men’s soccer team was knocked out in its postseason opener at home on both occasions.

For a team hungry to win its first Big West Championship in five years, the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opens up Big West play with road games today and Saturday against UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge, respectively. The Gauchos enter tonight’s match with a 5-3-1 record, which includes statement wins over No. 3 Stanford and on the road at UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were a national powerhouse last season, but have not found nearly the same success this time around, starting the year at 2-5-2. The Matadors started slowly in 2015, but won their last three games on the road to improve to 4-3-1 heading into conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, UCSB has been the best on offense this season, currently leading the Big West with 18 goals through nine games. Junior Nick DePuy has been a model of consistency since moving from the midfield to forward midway through last season, scoring 16 goals in his 22 games up front. He currently leads the Big West with seven goals and was named this week’s Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong came into the year as a player to watch coming out of Cate School and he has not disappointed. The lefty notched his fourth assist of the year in the Gauchos’ 4-0 win over San Diego this past Sunday, making him the conference’s sole leader in assists.</p>\n<p>Also providing an offensive punch has been sophomore Ahinga Selemani, who transferred from Michigan after his freshman year. The 5-8 forward has already matched his totals from last year with three goals and is currently tied with DePuy and one other player for first in the conference with 28 shots.</p>\n<p>Injuries have begun to wear UCSB down a bit, with several starters being kept out of the lineup in recent games. Juniors Ismaila Jome and Drew Murphy were unavailable to close out the Gauchos’ last four games, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada suffered an injury in practice that kept him out for last weekend’s games.</p>\n<p>In Quezada’s absence, the defense has looked shaky at times, but a pair of freshmen in defender Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg have been solid all year. The Gauchos are currently ranked fifth in the conference having allowed 11 goals to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>UCI has struggled to start the year, but it hosts UCSB tonight seemingly having solved its offensive problems which caused it to stumble out of the gates. Through their first seven games, the Anteaters were shutout four times, putting away just three goals total.</p>\n<p>In the past week, however, they have found a rhythm, putting away four scores in a win over LMU on Thursday, followed up by a three goal effort in a 4-3 overtime loss to UCLA.</p>\n<p>The second half could be worrisome for the Gauchos, who have conceded eight of their 11 goals allowed after halftime. This might favor the Anteaters, who have put away all but one of their 10 goals in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ivan Canales leads the offense in goals and assists with three each.</p>\n<p>The Matadors host Cal Poly tonight and UCSB on Saturday having won three consecutive games on the road.

We had high expectations of playing well and we didn’t play well,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key to Akron was to get wide play, to get service, to get players in the box, and about 25 minutes in we weren’t able to get that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After surviving early offensive pressure from the Gauchos, particularly coming from sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani who had a team-high three shots on the night, the Zips found themselves in a great position picking off a poorly placed back pass in the 35<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg reacted quickly to make a sliding save on Sam Gainford’s first attempt on goal, but the sophomore forward was first to the rebound and he scored easily. UCSB went into the half trailing 1-0, the first time it faced a deficit going into halftime all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Our back line was out of sorts, but the reality is we gave them that first goal and that allowed Akron to sit in with seven guys,” Vom Steeg said. “Coaching-wise, it was absolutely frustrating because I didn’t think that we had a lot of options available to us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Things didn’t get much better for the Gauchos from there. Akron was able to pack up on the defensive side for the rest of the game, stifling any half-chances UCSB could conjure up in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We looked a little tired. We had to chase the game after we went down and Akron was very good at staying in and keeping everybody in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you have to take the game to the other team, you need something to get a goal – something to change the momentum – and we just never got a goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Still searching for an equalizer in the 87<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute, an unfortunate attempt by the Gauchos to clear the ball from deep in their territory was deflected right to forward Stuart Holthusen. Vom Steeg rushed to meet the sophomore on the right side of the box, but the Akron man was able to place a shot past the keeper’s left and inside the near post to put the game away at 2-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being shutout for just the first time this season, the Gauchos bounced back strong on Sunday, looking more like the team that won 4-2 at UCLA just one week ago. UCSB was firing on all cylinders, scoring as many goals as San Diego had shot attempts with four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman defender Sam Strong picked up his second goal of the season just over eight minutes in, capitalizing on a rebound after a header from Selemani was saved wide by USD sophomore goalkeeper Thomas Olsen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The action picked up again in the second half, as UCSB put the game away with a pair of goals separated by just over a minute. Selemani was set up by a great run from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, who led a counterattack all the way down the left wing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Acheampong cut it back to find Selemani at the top of the box, where he found space away from his defender and blast a left-footed shot in off the keeper’s gloves at the near post. The first-year Gaucho has proven to be a solid number two attacking option alongside Nick DePuy, notching his third goal of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Speaking of DePuy, after what has become a rare occasion with the junior failing to find the back of the net on Friday, the 6-4 forward put the game away with a goal in the 60<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute. A Torero turnover gave junior midfielder Josue Espana the opportunity to send in a cross from deep down the left wing. Just as he has been so many times, DePuy was the first to the ball, knocking a shot past Olsen at the far post to make it 3-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">DePuy now has seven goals on the season, two more than anyone else in the Big West. As a team, the Gauchos have been outstanding on offense, scoring an average of two goals per game. Acheampong also leads the conference with four assists, while Espana and junior left back Ismaila Jome, are tied for second with three each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Making his debut for the Gauchos, freshman forward Jonah Adomakoh came off the bench to add another score, beating Olsen with a well-placed shot on a breakaway down the right side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB outshot San Diego 13-4 on the night, including 8-2 in shots on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Vom Steeg had a relatively simple night with two saves, a much more relaxed outing compared to Friday when he finished with a career-best seven saves and the Gauchos fell for the first time at home this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries have begun to take a toll on UCSB, with several key starters missing action in recent games. Ankle injuries have kept Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy out since UCSB’s game against College of Charleston on September 18, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada missed this past weekend’s action after being injured in practice. Sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi has gotten the start at center back during Quezada’s two-game absence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Santa Barbara will head back on the road this weekend to open up conference play against UC Irvine on Thursday and Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/mens-soccer-splits-pair-of-home-games-to-end-non-conference-play/","id":1502,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1501,1500,1499],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Gradually Heating Up, Prepare for Conference Opener at Hawai’i","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara managed to prevail for the 1-0 victory over Pacific.

Holding the Tigers to zero shots at the box, UCSB gained an opportunity at goal in the 32nd minute as freshman forward Jessica Parque lined up for a free kick, but booted the ball just over the goal post. Still, the Gauchos dominated ball possession throughout the first half, accounting for five corner kicks and four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>With the score locked at zero, the Gauchos were back in attack mode opening the second half. Within the first ten minutes, UCSB broke down the Tigers’ defense to put itself in scoring position. Mallory Hromatko made her mark in the match’s 64th minute, driving down the right line off a nice lead pass by Parque.  The freshman forward made her way to the middle of the box and sneaked a strike down into the back left of the post giving UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Pacific changed their system [in the second half] and we moved our lineup to three strikers to have one more body closer to goal,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It felt like it was just a matter of time because we had more looks [from that switch] and it ended up being our girl Mallory.”</p>\n<p>Hromatko has been a key component for her team’s success; racking up five goals and four assists all in non-conference play. Earning All-Big West Player of the Week honors following her game against Texas, Stumpf will likely keep Hromatko at the forward position heading into the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“She’s getting a lot of looks at the ball and it only takes one real good one where she can place one firmly into a corner,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with nine corner kicks and 13 shots, ten of them on goal.  Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter also made her presence known in the goal box, making a crucial save in the 70th minute to preserve the team’s 1-0 lead. UCSB’s consistent defense held the Tigers to one corner and one shot at the goal.</p>\n<p>Freshman defender Ryan Kokoska was a vital part of the Gauchos’ defense keeping the ball in the middle of the field and giving her teammates scoring opportunities. Kokoska accredits her efforts to the ability of her team to play as a unit.</p>\n<p>“We have so many strong individuals on our team that’s what makes us do so well,” Kokoska said.  “We’re a team together on and off the field and that will help us heading into conference.”</p>\n<p>Ending non-conference play on a good note, the Gauchos are ready for their Big West opener against Hawaii this Thursday, Oct. 1st. The Rainbow Wahine have a record of 3-6-1.</p>\n<p>The University of Hawaii will be fresh off its 2-0-overtime victory against BYU this past Friday. Look for forward Dani Crawford to make an impact for the Rainbow Wahine as the sophomore has racked up three goals for her team, including one goal in overtime contest.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ road conference opener will take place at 10 p.m. in Aloha Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

From that point on it was an uphill battle for UCSB, a situation they were not too familiar with prior to their overtime victory against other Atlantic-10 opponent Duquesne.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by two points, the Gauchos answered back in the 58th minute. Junior center midfielder Sara Feder attacked the middle and connected on a crossing assist from freshman forward Mallory Hromatko for a header score. But as time expired, the UCSB score occurred too late and Dayton pulled off the 2-1 upset. In spite of taking a total of 13 shot attempts, Santa Barbara’s quick striking tactics may have been too overbearing in its game plan.</p>\n<p>“I think consistency is a big focal point of our team goals,” Coach Paul Stumpf said. “I would love a consistent moniker of playing hard, effective and efficient soccer to rub off on us.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, last night’s match against CSU Bakersfield provided them with an opportunity to quickly overcome the disappointing loss. As far as the team’s demeanor and overall attitude with the conference season nearing, Coach Stumpf believes there is still a lot to be learned from the final action before Big West play begins.</p>\n<p>The last time UCSB faced off against Bakersfield was Sept. 14th during which the Gauchos cruised to a 2-0 victory at Harder Stadium. Angelisa Cortez scored an unassisted goal in the 18th minute that put her team in position to win the game.</p>\n<p>Last night, Santa Barbara earned its third shutout victory of the season in its 3-0 win over the Roadrunners. Bakersfield entered Wednesday’s match with a record of 2-5-1, hoping for similar results in which UCSB would be the victim of another upset but were unlucky.</p>\n<p>It was somewhat of a slow start for the Gauchos’, but a score by Hromatko jumpstarted UCSB’s fast-paced scoring run. Santa Barbara’s advantage in corner kicks definitely turned the match in its favor as UCSB recorded eight to Bakersfield’s zero.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ benefited from their landslide of corner kicks with scores by freshman midfielder Jessica Clegg in the 51st minute and Feder in the 61st minute.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara back to its winning ways, the Gauchos’ are now 6-3-1, while the Roadrunners hold a record of 2-6-1. UCSB will return to host the 1-5-1 Pacific Tigers this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Harder Stadium. This will be the Gauchos’ final non-conference game of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 24, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily

the road this past Monday, UCSB men’s soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg joked that maybe this could be the team to finally win a game at UCLA. Thanks to a second-half scoring outburst, the Gauchos’ pulled away from the Bruins for a 4-2 win and their first-ever road win against their UC counterpart.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to Harder Stadium this weekend for a pair of games against No. 9 Akron on Friday and San Diego on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With its second consecutive win and its first over UCLA since 2011, UCSB improves to 4-2-1 this season. The Bruins have struggled to start the season by their standards, as the loss was their fourth in five games, bringing their record to 2-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The winning formula for the Gauchos prior to Monday night’s game had been coming out strong in the first half, scoring first in each of their opening six games. That wasn’t the case this time around, however.<br>\nAfter conceding the opening goal on a penalty to UCLA’s Larry Ndjock 28 minutes in, UCSB answered back with four straight goals, including two from junior forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Offensive Player of the Year found an equalizer in the 38th minute, scoring off an assist from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong for the second straight week. After receiving a ball from DePuy down the left wing, Acheampong sent it right back to DePuy through the air, and was able to beat his defender and knock a header off the near post and in.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the half tied 1-1, UCSB took complete control from there, scoring three goals in less than 10 minutes. Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani gave the Gauchos the lead in the 54th minute, firing it in from the top of the box to make it 2-1.</p>\n<p>Just two and a half minutes later, DePuy scored another header off a corner kick from junior midfielder Josue España, giving him his sixth goal of the season. Soon after, DePuy returned the favor, forcing a turnover on the UCLA half before setting up España for his first goal as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>The Bruins were able to pick up another goal with sophomore forward Seyi Adekoya scoring in garbage time, but they fell well short of mounting a full comeback.</p>\n<p>UCSB had struggled to finish its chances in its last game against the College of Charleston, only scoring three times off a season-high 21 shots. The Gauchos were much more efficient finishing this time around, converting on half of their eight shots on goal to pick up their season-best mark of four goals. It was the first time the Bruins conceded four goals in a regular season game since 2010.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg improved his starting record to 4-2, tying a career high with four saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The secret to Santa Barbara’s success is no secret at this point. DePuy has a Big West-leading six goals through seven games. Dating back to last season, he has been on an incredible scoring run, tallying 11 scores in his last 13 appearances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth arguably their best effort of the season despite missing injured juniors Drew Murphy and Ismaila Jome, the only two Gauchos on the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team other than DePuy.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is Akron, which enters this weekend boasting a No. 9 national ranking and a record of 4-2-1. The Zips got off to a great start to their season that included back-to-back road wins over No. 25 Georgetown and No. 11 Maryland. Unlike the Gauchos, they have experienced success away from home this season, going 3-1 on the road.</p>\n<p>Powering Akron on the offensive side this season has been redshirt sophomore Sam Gainford and junior midfielder Adam Najem. Both players lead the team with four goals and three assists each and will look to break down a UCSB defense that has conceded just one goal at home this season.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos will face San Diego. The Toreros are currently 4-2-2 after winning 3-1 at Cal State Fullerton and 2-0 against San Jose State last weekend.

It’s a grind and in each game you just have to keep getting better.”</p>\n<p>The win on Friday improves the Gauchos’ record to 3-2-1 overall, while Charleston falls to an identical mark of 3-2-1.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long to get the action started, as UCSB forward Ahinga Selemani was aggressive early. After the sophomore transfer earned a corner just under six minutes in, junior midfielder Josue Espana set up Sam Strong for his first career NCAA goal. Espana’s corner sailed over a wave of players at the near post before falling perfectly to the freshman defender inside the six-yard box for an easy header, putting UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>It took only 85 seconds for the Cougars to answer back. Junior midfielder Eric Clark’s free kick found sophomore defender Cesar Murillo to tie it at 1-1, marking the first time the Gauchos have conceded a first half goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to eliminate making that one big mistake,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing with a young back line and I still feel like our communication, our spacing, we’re still prone to make a mistake going up for the same ball, so we just have to keep working on that.”</p>\n<p>After junior left back Ismaila Jome left the game with an ankle injury about 15 minutes in, freshman midfielder Geoffrey Acheampong filled in and was a menace on the offensive side. The former Cate School star led the way with two assists, his first coming with just over 26 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We got some good performances from some different players. In particular, I thought [Geoffrey] played his best college game,” Vom Steeg said. “We were planning to bring Geoffrey into [Jome’s] position anyway, but there was no need to actually bring Ish back into that game the way that Geoffrey was playing.”</p>\n<p>With his third corner attempt in under a minute, Acheampong played a ball into a packed six-yard box where junior forward Nick DePuy was able to establish position over his defender and place a header just inside the far post, giving his team a 2-1 lead heading into the half. Santa Barbara has now scored first in each of its six games and taken a lead into halftime in all but one.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s goal was his fourth of the season, tied for first in the Big West, and the eighth game-winner of his career. In the 12 games that DePuy has scored, the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 9-0-3.</p>\n<p>With just under 22 minutes to go in the game, Acheampong played in a low cross that found junior midfielder Andy Perez at the far post where he was able to power a deflected shot in off a defender to seal the 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“I just saw two guys trying to crash the box and my job was just to get it into the six,” Acheampong said. “It’s kind of a gray area there where the keeper doesn’t really know to stay or come out, so I just put it in between for Nick or Andy to crash it and it just landed at Andy’s foot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself threatening early and often, outshooting Charleston 21-4 on the night. Goalkeeper Kevin Shields was the easy choice for man of the match for the visiting side, as the junior made nine saves to keep the score line respectable.</p>\n<p>“I did feel like our offense really started to come alive today,” Vom Steeg said. “We really wore that team down, so our energy and our running was good.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, it wasn’t all smiles for the Gauchos. Already missing junior midfielder Drew Murphy to an ankle injury, UCSB now might also be without its starting left back Jome as well against UCLA after he suffered an apparent sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>The game was also delayed for an extended period of time in the first half when Charleston’s Eric Clark needed to be carted off after taking a hard fall while challenging for a header.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now shift their attention to tonight, where they will face a hostile Bruin crowd in a Pac-12 televised game. UCSB most recently fell to UCLA at Harder Stadium 1-0 last season and has not defeated its UC counterpart since 2011, going 0-3-1 since that last win.</p>\n<p>The Bruins enter with a 2-3 record this season, most recently ousting Big West opponent Cal Poly 4-1 on Friday. UCLA’s youth has powered it so far this season with seven of its eight goals coming from its underclassmen. Freshman midfielder Jackson Yueill and sophomore forward Seyi Adekoyi lead the way with two goals each.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set to kickoff at 7:00 p.m. at Drake Stadium and will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/","id":1498,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1497,1496,1495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Familiar Start for Men’s Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M-Soccer-v-Cal-Poly-by-Cameryn-Brock_exported-10.28.2014-3005.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M-Soccer-v-Cal-Poly-by-Cameryn-Brock_exported-10.28.2014-3005.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After its second consecutive 2-2-1 start to the season, the UCSB men's soccer team looks poised to finish with the No. 1 seed in the Big West once again.

After all, they were selected to repeat as Big West North Division Champions in the 2015 Preseason Coaches Poll.</p>\n<p>Bringing back core players in left back Ismaila Jome, midfielder Drew Murphy and forward Nick DePuy, all of whom are juniors who were named to the Preseason All-Conference Team, UCSB has experience on its side this time around.</p>\n<p>DePuy is the reigning Big West Offensive Player of the Year, having scored 10 goals and six game-winners last season. The former midfielder has already gotten off to a hot start to this season as well, notching three goals in five appearances, tied for first in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Murphy and Jome are coming off a season in which they each compiled a team-high five assists, with the latter having already tallied three assists this season, also tied for first in the conference.</p>\n<p>Kicking off their campaign against national powerhouse Stanford and star junior forward Jordan Morris, who has recently been seeing time playing for the US Men’s National First Team, the Gauchos got off to a perfect start to the season. DePuy was able to pick up right where he left off, scoring a first-half header off a cross from junior midfielder Seo-In Kim.</p>\n<p>A resistant UCSB defense shut down Morris and the Cardinal all night behind the great play of its defense. Fantastic debuts from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht and a couple of freshmen in center back Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg provided the Gauchos 90 minutes without a slip-up on the way to a 1-0 statement win over the team that was ranked No. 8 in the nation to start the year.</p>\n<p>Strong’s efforts earned him his first Big West Defensive Player of the Week award while Vom Steeg earned a call-up to play for the USMNT U-20 squad in Serbia the following weekend. The team’s top goalkeeper and son of Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has given the defense a comfortable, composed presence in goal, providing two shutouts and going 2-1 in his first three starts. His .800 save percent and 0.67 goals against average are both good for third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first road trip to New Mexico saw them tying 2-2 against Denver before falling 2-1 to host team No. 17 New Mexico. UCSB’s top two transfers in Feucht and sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani were named to the All-Tournament team, continuing to impress and solidify their spot in the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>Just this past weekend, Santa Barbara traveled to UConn where it bounced back with a 2-0 win over Yale before once again losing to the host team 2-1.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have tended to start games strong, scoring a goal in the first half of four out of their five games, they have conversely found themselves faltering late in games. Already three times this season, they have conceded two goals after halftime to lose their lead.</p>\n<p>Up next for UCSB is a home game against the College of Charleston, a team the Gauchos defeated on its home turf last season 2-1. The game will be played at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 12 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/","id":1504,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1503,1502,1501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hot Out of the Gates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo6-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Although the Gauchos lost their first two games of the season, their offense has caught fire in the month of September.

On a learning curve after going 8-9-2 last season, this group of 19 underclassmen has exceeded last year’s standards and proved to Head Coach Paul Stumpf that they are ready to play.</p>\n<p>Reaching the midway point of the preseason with an overall record of 4-2-1, UCSB has bounced back from tough losses early on to Saint Mary’s and USF to go on a five-game unbeaten streak.

Sophomore midfielder Chase Schornstein took advantage of this opportunity as she collected a pass over a Dukes defender from junior Dakota Griggs and launched a kick to the back of the goal post for the 1-1 equalizer.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long until freshman midfielder/forward Mallory Hromatko made her mark on the game as well, blasting a shot from the left side of the box into the right corner and sealing a 2-1 victory for the Gauchos in overtime.</p>\n<p>Hromatko wasn’t the only notable freshman that had a productive weekend. Sydney Magnin took advantage of her starting lineup job against 0-6-1 Saint Francis. The midfielder knocked in two goals for the Gauchos, one in the 4th and another in the 33rd minute of play, propelling her team to a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos head back to Meredith Field with hopes of extending their winning streak to five games.</p>\n<p>Their success thus far can be accredited to their impressive core of freshmen. Hromatko has carried the load for the Gauchos starting all nine games at forward and leading the team in scoring with nine points and three goals. The Danville, CA native earned herself a Big West Player of the Week nomination last week and looks to be the offensive anchor heading into the conference season.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parque, Dakota Griggs and Magnin hope to complement Hromatko’s dominant play on the offensivee side of the field as the regular season progresses. The three freshmen have combined for a total of four goals and four assists, all within their last three games.</p>\n<p>“These players are not freshman anymore,” said Stumpf. “They’re nine games in against some of the best competition and the experience they’ve drawn [from these matches] will prepare them for a very tough conference schedule ahead.”</p>\n<p>Schornstein and junior center midfielder Sara Feder will offer some valuable leadership to these young freshmen. Schornstein and Feder were valuable pieces to the team last season, scoring seven goals on the year. Both players were recognized for their play as Schornstein was named to the Big West All-Freshman team and Feder as an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>The Big West will be a new level of intensity for the Gauchos but Stumpf is optimistic for the beginning of conference play as his players have been familiar with this type of competitive play prior to playing for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I believe our team will be prepared as most of our players have come from really talented clubs teams who are used to competing at the highest level,” Stumpf said. “If we keep all of our opponents at one to two goals, we’re going to do some damage in this conference because we will score goals moving forward.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play a pair of home games this weekend against Montana at 5:00 p.m. on Friday and Dayton at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 12 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64664\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64664\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/","id":1499,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1498,1497,1496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women’s Soccer Heats Up During Return To Harder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' end winless streak with back-to-back victories in Harder Stadium","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>To say it was an important weekend is an understatement for UCSB’s women’s soccer team.

Coming into the match with an overall record of 1-1-1, the Longhorns size was a major obstacle for a much smaller UCSB team. But, the Gauchos were not afraid to battle for each possession and made their attacks in the front line count.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Mallory Hromatko was the main distributor for the Gauchos offensive attack. She consistently found her teammates around the goal box and racked up two assists along with one shot on goal. In the 57<sup>th</sup> minute, Hromatko advanced the ball toward the right side of the field making an in-and-out move on a Longhorn defender and crossed the ball to the middle of the field for an easy score by freshman forward Jessica Parque. Parque’s first career goal gave UCSB a 1-0 advantage coming out of the second half.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time [me and Mallory] got to play a lot of minutes together, but we built a natural connection tonight,” Parque said.</p>\n<p>A similar opportunity appeared for the Gauchos in the 86<sup>th</sup> minute as Hromatko made her attack past a Texas defender toward goal. Working the ball down the right wing of the field, Hromatko made a quality cross to sophomore midfielder Chace Schorstein who popped the ball over Texas goalkeeper Abby Smith in for the score. This was Schorstein’s first goal on the year and third of her career.</p>\n<p>“This week during practice we really focused on connecting with the forwards, something we were missing in our previous matches,” Hromatko commented. “I feel like tonight was our breakout game with that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos maintained control of the match following this point. While Texas outhit the Gauchos in total shots for the game, 11 shots to eight, a couple quality saves from Caginia sealed the deal and helped UCSB to its first win of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Caginia finished the night with four saves behind goal, all in the second half, including one diving save in the 59<sup>th</sup> minute of play off a header from Texas midfielder Kayra Dollas.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to come out strong against a good Texas team and show them that UCSB could hang with them,” Hromatko said.</p>\n<p>Sunday afternoon was another test for UCSB as Head Coach Randy Dedini and his Sacramento State team traveled to Harder Stadium. Coming off of a 3-2 win against CSU Bakersfield, the Hornets entered Santa Barbara with a 1-3 overall record, but liked their chances against an inexperienced UCSB team. Yet, it was the Gauchos’ young talent that proved to be the “x-factor” during the game’s early stages.</p>\n<p>UCSB struck first in the 17<sup>th</sup> minute off a corner kick connection from junior midfielder Dakota Griggs to Hromatko. Griggs served a perfect ball to the middle of the box as Hromatko climbed over two Hornet defenders sending a header shot into the right side of the goal post. UCSB had a 1-0 advantage until junior forward Adaurie Dayak scored the equalizer in the game’s 34<sup>th</sup> minute. Launching the ball 20 yards out to the upper right corner of the goal past a diving effort from Caginia, she gave Sac State a momentous 1-1 tie heading into the half.</p>\n<p>As the second half approached, the Gauchos took advantage of every early opportunity and eventually caught the Hornets off guard. Barely two minutes into the second half, UCSB’s Parque snagged a loose ball 20 yards out of the box and fired a shot past redshirt freshman goalkeeper Destiny Butcher to the upper right hand corner. Parque’s second goal of the weekend snapped a 1-1 tie and put UCSB back on top, 2-1.</p>\n<p>“We told our girls they would have a few more looks than Sac State in the second half and luckily our first opportunity went in which took a some pressure off and made all the difference for us,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>In the 72<sup>nd</sup> minute, Stumpf made a lineup change that moved senior Angelisa Cortez to the forward position in place of Hromatko. Beating her defender off the dribble, Cortez delivered a shot to the right corner of the box similar to Parque’s goal, giving the Gauchos some insurance and increasing their lead to 3-1.</p>\n<p>“Our team did a good job keeping the ball and wearing Sac State down to finally get that third goal a bit late,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s two wins over the weekend improved its overall record to 2-2-1. The Gauchos have built some solid chemistry these past couple of games and are currently on a two-game winning streak. But with a packed roster of 34 players, Stumpf hopes his players can keep their cohesiveness throughout the regular season.</p>\n<p>“We have 34 girls on the team and not everybody gets to play,” Stumpf said. “Do they deserve to play? Yes. But, unfortunately that’s just not the reality. That is the hard piece of the chemistry to keep their morale up and ready to step up [when asked].”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos pack their bags and take a trip to Pittsburgh for matches against Duquesne University on Friday, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> and St. Francis Sunday, Sept. 13<sup>th</sup>.

soccer team heads on its first road trip of the season to Albuquerque this weekend for games against Denver and New Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Our expectation is that we finish the weekend without giving up any goals,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think what we’re looking to do more than anything is getting our offense on track. That’s what I’m anxious to see this weekend.”</p>\n<p>With just one game under their belt, the Gauchos jumped up to a No. 19 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this week. Last Friday’s win made it five straight season-opening victories for UCSB, putting its record at 10-1 over the last 11 years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior forward Nick DePuy comes in as the Gauchos’ lone scorer, having put away the deciding goal in the 1-0 win over Stanford. Dating back to last year, the former midfielder has been on an incredible hot streak, scoring in six of his last seven games with eight total goals during that span.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re way too good offensively to not be able to dominate these two games, create goalscoring chances and maybe put two, three, four goals away,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point this year we’re going to be a team that other teams are really going to fear because we can come at you in a lot of different ways.”</p>\n<p>Last Friday’s game also welcomed defender Sam Strong to the lineup for the first time. The composed freshman gave an outstanding debut performance, shutting down a high-profile athlete in Stanford’s junior forward Jordan Morris, resulting in his being named the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. <em>College Soccer News</em> also named Strong to the National Team of the Week.</p>\n<p>“Sam and [sophomore defender Jeff] Quezada had a good game, our whole backline did, but we’re going to have to do it again,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing a New Mexico team that is going to be one of the better teams in the country. We have our work cut out for us, but Sam and Quezada played together all spring so they do have the chemistry, and I think there’s no reason why we can’t expect to shut people down again.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they will be without starting goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg. The superb freshman received a call up to the US Under-20 National Team roster to play in the Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament in Serbia this weekend after a solid performance of his own against last Friday.</p>\n<p>In Vom Steeg’s absence, sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who started and played well for much of last season, will get the start.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a fortunate situation where Brandon was in our goal last year for three quarters of the season,” Vom Steeg said. “It is an adjustment, you do lose a little bit of height with Brandon but at the same time he’s athletic, he’s quick, he gets to balls, he’s a hard-working goalkeeper and he has the confidence of the team.”</p>\n<p>With new Head Coach Jamie Franks leading the way, Denver has gotten off to a fantastic start to its 2015 campaign. The Pioneers have started 2-0-0, including a 4-0 win over CSU Bakersfield in their season opener. Taking into account their two exhibition games last month, they have gone a perfect 4-4 on shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>“I always feel like when any program has a new coach their players really listen and they’re all trying to prove themselves,” Vom Steeg said. “I always find that those are tough teams to play because you have a team that’s got a lot of energy and a lot of life.”</p>\n<p>New Mexico has played just one game this season, losing 1-0 to UCLA last Saturday. When the Lobos last hosted UCSB in 2013, they shut down the Gauchos on their way to a 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“New Mexico is a lot like us in that they will have a very large crowd<strong>. </strong>They are a team that’s usually built for their field, and it’s just one of the harder places to play,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s going to be a test for us and it’s a game where you really start to find out a lot about your team, especially when you’re on the road.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road has caused problems for UCSB in the past, as it won just three of nine games away from Harder Stadium last year, and New Mexico’s impactful crowd support could make it a difficult environment to play in. However, with a more experienced roster that won its last two crucial road games to close out the season in 2014, the Gauchos should perform well in their first road test.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the areas where we just have to do better,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can find a result, that’s something that we can continue to build on.

Head Coach Angela Kelly and her Longhorns finished the 2014 season with an 11-8-4 record, good enough to clinch the fifth seed in conference play. The Longhorns are a confident team on the road claiming a record of 6-2 last season so expect them to play with poise and not be phased by the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Notables for Texas include 5-10 sophomore Olivia Brook. As a freshman, Brooke led the team in scoring with 16 points, seven goals and 18 shots on goal. Brooke proved to be the offensive target for Texas, registering a game-winning goal against archrival No. 21 Texas Tech for an upset win in overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior mid Lindsey Meyer will also be a player that UCSB must defend well against. Meyer finished second overall on the team in scoring with 12 points and five goals. Like Brooke, Meyer is not afraid of the big moment, seizing two game-winners during her junior campaign including one in the Big-12 Quarterfinal against Texas Tech.</p>\n<p>Defending that Longhorn frontline and containing the play of duo Brook and Meyer will be a crucial factor in UCSB’s success on Friday.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos’ key to success their strategy is simple: continue to attack the frontline as they did in their match against San Jose State.</p>\n<p>Coach Stumpf found that his forwards are at their best when they act as the aggressor and must use their athleticism to their advantage against the Longhorns’ backline.</p>\n<p>“The challenge that our frontline faces is to maintain possession so we can have numbers and pick and choose their moments to take a risk for a scoring opportunity,” Stumpf said. “We need to do a better job keeping the ball when it’s required and deciding when to drop a shoulder to beat someone 1-v-1.”</p>\n<p>On top of their big match against Texas on Friday, the Gauchos host another non-conference opponent this Sunday in Sacramento State. The Hornets are currently 0-3 on the year including a 2-1 loss to San Jose State last Sunday.</p>\n<p>Look for junior midfielder Maggie Pleis to be a focal point for Sac State. Pleis leads the team this season with one goal and three shots on goal. Pleis earned the honor of All Big-Sky Second Team as a sophomore and racked up 22 shots with 10 shots on goal for the Hornets last season.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, Stumpf emphasized that his team must be very mindful and take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>“Friday night is going to be very physically demanding on us. No matter what happens, we will have to put that behind us and do everything we can physically and mentally to be ready for Sacramento.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kickoff their match with Texas tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Sac State on Sunday at 1 p.m at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

women’s soccer team as it played its first home game of the year versus the San Jose State Spartans. Learning from last Sunday’s tough loss at USF, an early goal put the Gauchos in a favorable position until San Jose State answered with a first half goal of its own, sending the game into extra minutes and finishing in a 1-1 tie. UCSB remains winless with an overall record of 0-2-1 as the draw gives San Jose State a 1-1-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>The match was ignited by the Gauchos aggressive play in the game’s first 45 minutes. At the 11:16 mark, a Spartan loose ball was gathered by freshman forward Mallory Hromatko, who then pushed it down the right side of the field until she booted it in the upper left corner of the goalpost. Hromatko tallied in her first career score and snapped UCSB’s two-game goal drought.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Before this game I told myself I need to take people one on one more,” Hromatko said. “I just put my head down and went towards the goal and it all worked out.”</p>\n<p>However, as the game neared its 28<sup>th</sup> minute, the Spartans responded with a goal of their own. Freshman forward Darriell Franklin managed to sneak in a score toward the bottom left corner of the goalpost. While a front line of UCSB defenders seemed ready for the attack, a precise assist from junior midfielder Maricruz Chapa helped set up Franklin for the score. Franklin collected the pass on the right-hand side of the box, and despite a diving effort from senior goal keeper Beth Ritter, Franklin evened the game at a score of 1-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ urgent play carried over into the game’s second half, but they were unable to capitalize on their shots on goal. Sophomore forward Amanda Ball fought for loose balls as her physical play helped weaken San Jose’s defense. Her one shot towards the post could have sealed the win, but Ball’s attempt shanked just left of the goal with three minutes remaining in regulation leading to overtime.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we did well, but we just need more work ethic up top connecting on passes with each other and working as a team,” Ball said.</p>\n<p>With ten minutes added to the game clock, both teams battled for possession of the ball at both ends of the field. After a yellow card was called on freshman midfielder Sydney Magnin, tensions continued to rise as chippy play increased heading into double overtime. Although two corner kicks put UCSB in great field position, the Gauchos could not take advantage of the scoring opportunities, ending with a 1-1 draw in their first match at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“We only scored one goal in 110 minutes so unfortunately that’s not enough, Stumpf said. “We still have another big step to take.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and SJSU combined for a total of 12 shots on goal in the 110 minutes of play. Five yellow cards and 37 fouls were called on the field during Friday’s match as each team evidently made its presence known.</p>\n<p>A total of eight UCSB freshmen saw action against the Spartans, while four from the group played in the last two series of each overtime.</p>\n<p>“We have so many young players getting important experience early on,” Stumpf said. “Those four freshmen were great during overtime and they’re going to get nothing but better going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shift their focus onto their next match on Friday, Sept. 4th as they will host the Texas Longhorns. Kickoff will begin at 7:00 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Steeg didn’t want to use the word “revenge” coming into the UCSB men’s soccer team’s first game of the season against No. 8 Stanford, but that’s what the Gauchos got. An aggressive first half header by junior forward Nick DePuy was all Santa Barbara needed to come away with a 1-0 win and start its season off on a great note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We take a lot of pride in the way we played tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we battled all the way through, we got great bench contribution. I thought that we found out a lot about ourselves tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB last faced Stanford on the road in September of last season in a game in which the Gauchos conceded three goals in the first 12 minutes on their way to a 4-1 loss. With a more experienced squad this time around, UCSB was able to keep finding ways to preserve a shutout and defeat the Cardinal for the first time since 2004.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We’ve been playing that video for our guys for about eight months and looking forward to this game,” Vom Steeg said. “The gameplan was a little more defensive all the way because I knew that we could break out on them, which we did, but the defense won tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The first 10 minutes of the game was all Stanford as the Cardinal came out aggressive and was able to put some pressure on the UCSB backline. Stanford’s best chance of the half came 20 minutes in, when sophomore midfielder Drew Skundrich was found with a chipped through ball in the box, forcing UCSB goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg off his line. Skundrich was able to get off a decent header, but the composed freshman made an outstanding leg save to keep the game scoreless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Justin did well. He got his first shutout and his first yellow card, so he’s got one more than I do in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “He was very clean with all the balls that came in. When you play with a goalie that the defense is confident having behind, if they have a player break through, you know Justin is going to make a play for you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being subbed in with less than 16 minutes to go in the half, UCSB midfielder Seo-In Kim made an instant impact. Playing in his first regular season game with UCSB, the junior transfer from Duke used his speed to find space down the right side before sending in a slightly deflected cross towards the far post. Just as he did all last season, DePuy attacked the ball in the air and was able to power a header past Stanford junior goalkeeper Andrew Epstein to put the Gauchos up 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“When I came in, I knew I could make a difference,” Kim said. “Tim really talked about breaking the defense, breaking the defensive midfield line, that’s what I want to do. Just having Nick up there, you can’t really miss him, so it made my job easy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">With the goal, DePuy has now scored in six of his last seven games dating back to last season with eight goals during that stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Less than four minutes into the second half, Stanford thought it tied the game with a goal off a free kick into the box, but UCSB was saved by an offside call.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Much of the second half saw the Cardinal pushing men forward in search of a goal, resulting in a couple of good chances with just under 30 minutes to go. Fortunately for UCSB, a pair of Stanford shots from the edge of the 18-yard box were poorly hit, one being easily saved by Vom Steeg and the other sailing high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">A couple of fan favorites in sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong nearly connected to put the game away midway through the final stanza. For the second time in the half, Selemani beat not one, but two defenders down the left side before finding Acheampong making a run into the box. The lefty tried to set himself up on his favored foot, making it a difficult angle for the shot, and he sent it just wide of the post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries then became an issue for UCSB as Kim, junior left back Ismaila Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy all required clock stoppages in order to be subbed out towards the end of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos found themselves playing mainly on their defensive half for the final 10 minutes of the match. Stanford’s last good chance came with 1:09 remaining, when a cross from the left wing found Foster Langsdorf wide open in the box, but his header went wide and an exhausted UCSB defense was soon able to celebrate the impressive 1-0 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Midfielder Kevin Feucht was perhaps the game’s best player. The sophomore transfer did all the little things, putting his body on the line to make big plays defensively before helping transition to offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I thought Kevin was unbelievable tonight. The back line were really relying on him to kind of pick up things in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “He threw his body around in the middle of that park, broke up so many plays and stretched out for tackles. That’s a player that’s going to help you win a lot of games with that kind of work rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After missing last week’s game against Westmont due to a groin injury, defender Sam Strong was a big addition for the Gauchos at center back. The freshman looked comfortable all game, making few mistakes and winning a number of headers deep in the box.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We just had to compete and not let them get behind us and that’s what we did,” Strong said. “My groin felt better two days ago and it was a good sign, so I knew I was going to play. I didn’t know I was going to go 90, but it felt good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Four Gauchos picked up yellow cards on the day, including DePuy, Strong and Vom Steeg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I really feel like this is a team that’s just going to get better and better,” Vom Steeg said. “What’s exciting about this group is come see us play in six weeks and I think it’ll be much better than we saw tonight, which was good enough to beat Stanford.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB will look to continue a great start to the season with games against Denver and New Mexico next Friday and Sunday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/","id":1400,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1399,1398,1397],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":17,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
