The Titans will hope to secure their third straight conference title.</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the match, CSUF started to grab a hold of the tempo and was quickly rewarded for its early energy when freshman forward Rei Dorwart’s sweetly struck effort found the top-right corner to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the match’s ninth minute.</p>\n<p>The Titans maintained control throughout the majority of the first half, limiting the Gauchos’ potent attack to just three shots. The top seeded Gauchos entered the half down 1-0, struggling to create anything up front.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get to enough balls first tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Like everything else, we’ve got a long offseason to look at that. We discussed this all year, and this is the first UCSB team in some time that had no wide play on either side.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton struck almost immediately at the start of the second half when a poor UCSB clearance bounced to Fullerton’s sophomore midfielder Ross McPhie.</p>\n<p>McPhie capitalized on the possession when his low shot rolled to the right of UCSB goalkeeper Brandon Berke for the score to double Fullerton’s lead to 2-0. The second goal forced the Gauchos to pick up the pace for the last 43 minutes, but the Titans’ conference-best defense was up to the test.</p>\n<p>After several scoring opportunities and corner kicks, UCSB reached the back of the net in the 64th minute when freshman winger Noah Billingsley beat his man down the flank before firing in a hard low ball across the face of the goal post, in which Feucht was there to pounce on the chance.</p>\n<p>For the next 15 minutes, the Gauchos controlled the pace of play and looked likely to score, but were unable to find the equalizer.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Josue España, who had been playing with a slight knee injury since the first Cal Poly game, looked to be reinjured after a hard challenge on the counter.</p>\n<p>Although he returned for five minutes, the team’s assist leader garnering seven assists had to come out early in the last game of his impressive two-year stay at Harder. Playing through injury, the senior managed to bring the home crowd to its feet on several occasions with his flicks and tricks before his exit.</p>\n<p>España and Billingsley looked the most likely to create the game-tying chance, and the latter came within inches as his header from the middle of the box slipped just left of the frame.</p>\n<p>Feucht and Big West Offensive Player of the Year senior forward Nick DePuy each led the Gauchos with three shots, but Fullerton eventually regained control for the final 10 minutes to see out their second straight postseason victory at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DePuy has had a great four years, three-time Big West Offensive Player of the year, but I think the one player that kind of drove our team and made so much happen for us was Josue,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West First Team selection in 2015, España provided another dynamic to the Gauchos’ gameplan in his ability to play both on and off the ball.</p>\n<p>“We wish he could’ve come as a freshman but we got him for two years, and you’ll take what you get,” Vom Steeg said. “From that Cal Poly game and on, he has been giving us what he can, but it’s just not 100 percent. When he started to slow down offensively, we really started to slow down because he was the one player that could get us through the midfield.”</p>\n<p>The semifinal was the last match of five Gauchos’ collegiate careers as DePuy, España, midfielder Riley Peterson, midfielder Josue Salgado and captain midfielder Andy Perez will move onto their post-UCSB endeavors.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the graduating class, their final year wasn’t topped off with a conference or national championship, but Vom Steeg will have several holes to fill before the start of next season, a testament to how crucial the outgoing class was to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>Fullerton and CSUN, the two top teams from the South division, will now face off in Northridge Saturday night for the Big West crown.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB was the most represented side in the league in the regular season awards.</p>\n<p>“It shows that we have strong players and a quality team,” Feucht said. “It goes to show how much we’ve found each other this year, and we were unbeaten until the last game in conference so we’ve shown we’re a good team.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Cal State Fullerton had its fair share of match-winners too. Senior striker Alex Heilmann leads the Big West with 11 goals and was one of three Titans named to the All-Conference First and Second Teams. The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>In hopes of countering the Titan’s sheisty defense, the Gauchos bring plenty of firepower up top, averaging 1.58 goals for almost 0.3 goals per game more than CSUN, the second most prolific offense in the conference.</p>\n<p>Much of the threat comes from the trio of Selemani having tallied seven goals, DePuy with six and Feucht rounding things out with 10, whose interchanging runs in the front have picked open Big West opposition all season long. España leads UCSB with seven assists.</p>\n<p>“You have to ask me after the game whether we’re the best offense or they’re the best defense,” Feucht said. “We have to play to find out.’</p>\n<p>When the two teams faced off earlier this season at Fullerton, the host gave the Gauchos a tough match, but the visitors ended up heading back to Santa Barbara with a 2-1 overtime win thanks to Kevin Feucht’s match winner on an assist from España. The Gauchos star-studded attack will pose the sternest test Fullerton has faced in weeks.</p>\n<p>As for injuries, all of the regulars are healthy for UCSB, and the highly promising freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who has missed most of the season with a groin injury that he aggravated again at home against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Amo is hoping to fight back into the team as the postseason picks up. His injury against Poly was far less serious than his first setback of the year, keeping him out of training for a couple weeks, but the first-year product has a chance to come back into the squad in the next match.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place at Harder Stadium on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 7 p.m. Follow <em>@thenexus_sports</em> for all things Gaucho soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/","id":1412,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1411,1410,1409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Timely Save: Rogers’ Impactful Presence","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15034259_1290606394303314_999928836_o.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15034259_1290606394303314_999928836_o.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering her collegiate career as the backup behind four players, the journey of UCSB women's soccer goalkeeper junior Brittney Rogers has required much patience.

Thus, the incredible plays and blocks consistently executed by Rogers throughout the year were not the result of experience at the collegiate level, but rather the result of hours of diligent training in the off-season and an indelible passion for the game.</p>\n<p>Before stepping out on the field for the first time this year, Rogers had only made one appearance in her entire UCSB career.</p>\n<p>After redshirting her freshman year, Rogers did not see the field much, amassing just 10 minutes of playing time during her first year of eligibility the following year in which she recorded a total of four saves.</p>\n<p>Determined to earn and embrace a larger role on the team, Rogers took to the gym and the practice field in the off-season, and earned herself the starting goalie spot for the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Murrieta, California, Rogers spent most of her time in school or out on the soccer field. She played for Murrieta Valley High School, and also played at the club level with Legends F.C.</p>\n<p>While on Legends, she helped her team to the 2013 and 2014 Region IV championships. Legends F.C. also won the 2014 National Cup title.</p>\n<p>While playing on the Legends team, she was a teammate of UCSB’s current starting forward junior Amanda Ball. Ball just so happened to be on UCSB’s recruiting radar at the time. While not a proven fact, it is plausible that Ball’s departure for the Central Coast peaked Rogers interest, as she soon followed.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Rogers has never looked back and has enjoyed her choice of UCSB to continue her playing career. Rogers has particularly enjoyed the coaching staff, consisting of Head Coach Paul Stumpf and Assistant Coaches Austin Risenhoover and Sam Hayden.</p>\n<p>“The coaching staff is great,” Rogers said. “All the technical things are really building and their coaching style is very direct. They tell you exactly what they want. The chemistry this year [was] the strongest I’ve ever seen it.”</p>\n<p>Helping promote this chemistry has a large part to do with Rogers’ own presence on the team as well.</p>\n<p>In just one year as the starting goalkeeper, Rogers was able to humbly establish herself as a leader amongst her teammates. What sets Rogers apart from most is that she doesn’t impose an overbearing sense of control. Rather, she demonstrates a more subtle style of leadership that makes her an approachable and comforting player on the team.</p>\n<p>“She is a leader, but in a somewhat quiet way,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Her communication style is very calm and confident.”</p>\n<p>Although she loves soccer, Rogers didn’t always play goalkeeper while growing up. In fact, she didn’t really aspire to be a goalkeeper; it was something she stumbled upon.</p>\n<p>“When I was younger I was kind of just put there. But once I started training, I began to really like the process,” Rogers said.</p>\n<p>Though a childhood coach proved to be her initial inspiration for the position, that guidance was not the only influence in Rogers becoming an expert in guarding the net.</p>\n<p>Former UCSB goalkeeper Beth Ritter served as a mentor and role model to Rogers during her first two years on the team. Rogers believes much of her college success has in fact come from Ritter.</p>\n<p>“Being a freshman with four other goalies [ahead of me] was a little intimidating, but watching Beth play, I got inspired to be out on the field,” Rogers said. “Last summer all I wanted was to be out on the field. I went to weights everyday [with the thought of the season as motivation].”</p>\n<p>Her first two years on the team were more than just learning from the bench. Rogers actively pushed herself every day to become the best goalkeeper she could be as the 2016 season approached. And when it did, Rogers exuded a whole new level of confidence, appearing as a much better and improved version of herself.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73945\" style=\"width: 353px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73945\" data-attachment-id=\"73945\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73945\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o-1024x682.jpg?resize=343%2C228\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Brittney Rogers\" width=\"343\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14970949_1290606294303324_1089347599_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Brittney Rogers</p></div>\n<p>“She has committed herself in the weight room, and in her nutrition. She has made herself much more athletic in the past two years,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The determination and drive Rogers embodies has gotten her far in her soccer career. Rather than letting herself get down about the lack of playing time she saw in her first two years on the squad, Rogers used it as motivation to work harder.</p>\n<p>Rogers took initiative in finding influential role models and leaders around her, who later shaped her into the all-around great soccer player she is today.</p>\n<p>“I was pushing to earn that starting spot. I know not playing my freshman and sophomore years are tough, but pushing through that, it’s all been worth it now in retrospect,” Rogers said.</p>\n<p>The transformation of Rogers from her redshirt freshman year to now is an inspiration in itself. She has evolved into a key player for the Gauchos women’s soccer program.</p>\n<p>So far, she has gone above and beyond the expectations of her teammates and coaches. The success she has brought to her team should be commended.</p>\n<p>In three words, Rogers described her teammates as “determined, passionate and hungry.”</p>\n<p>It looks like Rogers is in the right place. There is little doubt that Coach Stumpf is looking forward to having his stopper in goal for two more years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73707\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73707\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-timely-save-rogers-impactful-presence/","id":1406,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1405,1404,1403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Miss Postseason Despite Commanding Start","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"All that starts well certainly does not always end well as the UCSB women's soccer team saw its playoff chances officially diminish this weekend after losses to UC Davis and Long Beach State, resultin...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s soccer team was forced to say goodbye to the 2016 season after a heartbreaking elimination from contending for a seed in the Big West Conference Tournament this weekend.</p>\n<p>It was a stunning turnaround for a Gaucho team that started the season with a brilliant 8-0 run.

Against the Aggies on Thursday, without their injured top scorer junior forward Amanda Ball, the Gauchos still managed to have a spectacular first half.</p>\n<p>They entered into the break leading 1-0 with tough defense and an opportunistic offense. The Gaucho defense held the Aggies to one shot in the first half, while getting off five shots of their own.</p>\n<p>Just 15 minutes into the game, UCSB’s senior midfielder Dakota Griggs found the back of the net to give Santa Barbara the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>It was Senior Night on Thursday for the Gauchos, and senior midfielder Dakota Griggs scored what would prove to be her final goal in a fine career at Santa Barbara. Also, senior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia was in goal for the full 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>She had two saves in the game to close out her Gaucho career. Other seniors honored were Ana Cruz, Ashley Dean, Hannah Dearborn, Savannah Francis, Sydney Fuertes, Kailey Hackett and Cristina Polini.</p>\n<p>But in the second half, Davis took charge when it scored the equalizer in the 60th minute on a goal by freshman forward Olivia Jones. Davis went on to score the game winner in the 87th minute, taking advantage of UCSB’s vulnerabilities on defense as the Gauchos played a riskier game in search of scoring opportunities on offense. This resulted in Aggies’ freshman forward Nicole Carson finding the net for the 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, UCSB — who was already eliminated from playoff contention — lost to a tough playoff-bound 49ers team, 1-0, when 49er freshman forward Ashley Gonzales scored on a penalty kick in the 67th minute. Gaucho sophomore keeper Brittney Rogers had a stellar game with six saves, but couldn’t find a way to stop the penalty kick.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense played another solid game, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough to close out the season with a win. Although it was shutout, UCSB had five shots, all of them on goal.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Dakota Griggs led the way with two shots on goal, while sophomore midfielder Maddie Gibson, senior defender Savannah Francis and junior midfielder Chace Schornstein all had one each.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finished the season with an 11-6-2 overall record and a 2-5-1 record in conference play, landing it in sixth place of the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Long Beach finished at 8-6-4 overall, 4-1-3 in the Big West and is headed to the tournament as the number four seed.</p>\n<p>With the season now over for the Gauchos, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will look to rebuild for next year. The Gauchos have a young squad loaded with talent, and the 2017 season should be exciting and full of promise.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gauchos-to-miss-postseason-despite-commanding-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gauchos-to-miss-postseason-despite-commanding-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gauchos-to-miss-postseason-despite-commanding-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gauchos-to-miss-postseason-despite-commanding-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gauchos-to-miss-postseason-despite-commanding-start/","id":1407,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1406,1405,1404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Clinches Big West North with 1-0 Win at Sac State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Now just one win away from ending the season with an undefeated Big West conference record, the UCSB men's soccer team got one step closer to the achievement in its 1-0 victory over the Sacramento Sta...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After failing to clinch the division last Saturday vs. Cal Poly in a defensive 0-0 draw, the UCSB men’s soccer team managed to achieve the feat Wednesday on the road as junior winger Ahinga Selemani’s 81st minute winner gave the Gauchos an edge to knock off the Hornets, 1-0, to clinch a seat at the conference semifinals.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

With zero shots on goal recorded in the first period, the second half marked the Hornets attempt to come out playing like a team that had to win to keep their division title hopes alive.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos broke the deadlock, though, when sophomore defender Jan Ilskens recorded the first point of his collegiate career when he found Selemani at the top of the box, who drilled his left-footed shot into the top right corner for the winger’s fourth game winner of the season.</p>\n<p>After the visitors took the lead, Sac State turned it up a notch, creating several great chances in the final 10 minutes. However, it was unable to find the equalizer in the end, thanks to a solid team performance by the UCSB defense.</p>\n<p>Playing without starting junior fullback Randy Mendoza (yellow cards) and freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who once again aggravated his groin injury against Cal Poly, it seemed plausible that the Gauchos would be at a disadvantage. However, freshmen Lamar Batista and Kyle Perno filled in the gaps with aplomb on the offensive end in a season-defining match.</p>\n<p>“That was a huge challenge of ours, and in the early season we had a hard time finishing games and unfortunately dropped a lot of points,” Selemani said. “Mentally, we locked in. We’re a lot more focused now, and you can tell that everyone’s aware when the clock is ticking in the dying moments, so I think we’re doing a better job now.”</p>\n<p>Le Roux made sure the Gauchos held onto their one-goal lead in the final minutes with a few clearances and saves to improve his scoreless run in goal to a season-long 285:22 minutes. The true freshman from Paris has been a revelation in his debut season, leading the NCAA with 1698:12 minutes, and the goalkeeper hasn’t missed a single second of game time.</p>\n<p>Selemani’s strike in the 81st was his seventh of the season, placing him second on the team and third in the conference. Since the start of Big West play, the Ann Arbor native has the most goals in Big West play with five in the last nine matches. The Gaucho attack has been well balanced all year with three players in the top five of Big West goal scorers with junior midfielder Kevin Feucht atop the charts with 10 goals and senior striker Nick DePuy tied for fifth with six.</p>\n<p>“It’s been exciting taking on a new role, and it all comes from practicing in the offseason, taking shot after shot, so finally getting results has been good,” Selemani said. “We’ve been playing well together, and everyone is finding one another, and we’ve found a way to get the offense going.”</p>\n<p>DePuy’s 15 goals last season — the top in the nation during the regular season — made up just over 35 percent of the team’s goals. However, this year, that figure has dropped to around 20 percent thanks to the telling contributions from elsewhere in the attack.</p>\n<p>As DePuy’s unlucky recent goal drought continues with the forward having just one goal in the team’s last eight matches, Feucht, Selemani and company have picked up the slack as the Gauchos’ unbeaten streak in conference is one game away from ending in an undefeated Big West season.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is the last home game of the season Sunday against UC Davis. The match will be played at Harder Stadium at 2 p.m., the team’s last game before beginning its postseason run with a Big West semifinal on Nov. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/","id":1408,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1407,1406,1405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos in Vulnerable State, Hopeful in Final Two Matches of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=883%2C456&ssl=1","description":"After experiencing back-to-back defeats for the first time this season, UCSB is ready to turn it around in the final week of Big West regular season play.

Aside from starting the season with an incredible eight-game winning streak that matched the longest for UCSB women’s soccer in 20 years, they have also scored an impressive total of 28 goals on the year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB will look to ignite that same spark in hopes of a strong finish to its season in addition to attempting to lock a playoff spot. In order to continue that success, the Gauchos will need to rely on the backbone of their team: their defense.</p>\n<p>While the numbers prove that UCSB has been more than capable of scoring goals, being able to hold other teams to a limited amount of scoring opportunities is just as important when it comes to the team’s game plan.</p>\n<p>“Keeping opposing teams to zero or one goal takes a lot of pressure off of our attackers,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Now, to win a game, we might only need one or two goals of our own. Our team defending has been a significant part of our success this year.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho starting sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers has been a huge asset to her team this year. Collecting 38 saves and six shutouts, she has played a valuable and effective role in the team’s defense. Without her achievements this year in protecting the net, the Gauchos would not likely hold the successful winning record they currently possess.</p>\n<p>Similarly, junior forward Amanda Ball has made major contributions this season, having scored a Big-West-leading 10 goals. Sophomore forward Mallory Hromatko and freshman midfielder Shaelan Murison are also key offensive players with four goals each.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB’s charge in setting up these attackers with scores has been sophomore midfielder Maddie Gibson, who leads the team with five assists.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Ashley Dean, senior defender Savannah Francis, senior midfielder Dakota Griggs and sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin have also contributed on the assisting end with three apiece.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis Aggies currently sit with the Gauchos in fourth place in the standings; however, UCSB leads them in multiple offensive categories. In the key category of goals scored, the Gauchos have tallied 28 this season to the Aggies’ 21. Another key category is corner kicks where Davis has earned 83 while the Gauchos have put together 111.</p>\n<p>However, as with every game, it will be important for UCSB to go into this match treating the Aggies as a tough competitor capable of defeating any team.</p>\n<p>“It would be a mistake by our players to think we can just show up and win. [UC Davis] are going to be tough no matter what their record is,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there are a number of impact players on the UC Davis roster that cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p>In the front of the field, the veteran duo of senior forwards Celina Minissian and Rachel Ahr has led UC Davis on offense as both have currently scored four goals each. Also contributing are sophomore forward Crystal Crump and freshman forward Nicole Carson, as both lead the team with three assists each.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Alexis Smith has been the permanent goalkeeper for the Aggies as she has played every game from start to finish, collecting a total of 65 saves and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will make for a more challenging opponent as it sits one place above the Gauchos in the Big West standings. The 49ers have scored a total of 25 goals this season and have put together 98 corner kicks.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Long Beach’s defense has been stellar, allowing only 16 goals.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Ashley Gonzales stands out on the roster with her team-high eight goals this season. She has had a total of 21 shots on goal and three assists. Gonzales ranks among the program’s career leaders with 17 goals and 10 game winners. Senior midfielder Mimi Rangel will be another tough competitor having scored four goals this season along with four assists.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Ashton McKeown holds the 49ers down in the goalie box with five shutouts and 54 saves.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face the UC Davis Aggies at home at Harder Stadium on Thursday, Oct. 27 at 7 p.m., then will be on the road to take on the Long Beach State 49ers on Sunday, Oct. 30 at 2 p.m. at George Allen Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-in-vulnerable-state-hopeful-in-final-two-matches-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-in-vulnerable-state-hopeful-in-final-two-matches-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-in-vulnerable-state-hopeful-in-final-two-matches-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-in-vulnerable-state-hopeful-in-final-two-matches-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-in-vulnerable-state-hopeful-in-final-two-matches-of-season/","id":1410,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1409,1408,1407],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope to Avoid Being Stung by Hornets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccerVSSacState20151028-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccerVSSacState20151028-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos looking to clinch North Big West division in final road match of the season this Wednesday.

The Hornets got their first point at UCSB since the Tim Vom Steeg era took over back in 1999, while also halting the Gauchos’ then three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As things stand, the Hornets look likely to find their way into Big West playoffs, and could pull off a shocking division title with a win in their next two matches along with the help of two Santa Barbara losses this weekend.</p>\n<p>That being said, it’s a tall task considering how UCSB has tightened up in the back in recent weeks and has seemingly found the formula of fighting through tough games to get positive results.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have played five overtime matches in league thus far — posting a 2-0-3 record in those matches — and although the long games might take a bit of a physical toll, the side will be one of the most tested teams around come postseason play.</p>\n<p>Following their five-game losing streak, Vom Steeg’s men have yet to lose and, despite dropping out of the Coaches’ Poll after peaking as high as No. 4, have managed to climb their way back into the conversation, receiving a vote for the first time in nearly a month and a half.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, six players will be honored at Senior Night for the outgoing class’ final home game of the regular season. DePuy; senior midfielders Seo-In Kim, Josue España and Riley Peterson; and senior defenders Andy Perez and Josue Salgado will all be hoping to end their final season with a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s match will be played against Sac State at 3 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p>The senior day battle against UC Davis will take place on Sunday, Oct. 30, at Harder Stadium at 2 p.m. The game will be aired on BigWestTV.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Maxwell took advantage of the easy pass and put the shot right past Gaucho sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers for a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Maxwell-Barrio duo would strike again before the end of the half. After working hard to carry the ball down into Gaucho territory, Barrio executed a soaring pass into the box where Maxwell responded with a header that would send the ball into the far post and put the score at 3-0.</p>\n<p>While the scoreboard said otherwise at the conclusion of Friday’s match, UCSB did have a few opportunities on offense.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Amanda Ball was able to get one shot off, along with sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin. Senior midfielder Dakota Griggs contributed with two attempts; the Gauchos, however, were unable to get any on goal.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders finished with a total of eight shots while UCSB registered four, all occurring in the second half. Each team saw two corner kicks and two saves.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game against the Anteaters was another disheartening loss for the Gauchos as they were unable to come back from being down a goal in search of the equalizer. After putting a goal on the board early in the first half, the Anteaters’ defense was able to limit the Gauchos’ offense to keep the count at 1-0 for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>The only goal of the game was off of a UCSB mistake when Anteater junior midfielder Alex Karlowitsch intercepted a Gaucho pass. Karlowitsch was then able to transition the steal into an offensive play during which she made a clean pass to teammate redshirt junior defender Noel Baham. Baham then took a shot from 10 yards out to score what would be the only goal of the game.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were unable to complete a single goal, they outshot the Anteaters 13-2. However, only two were on frame while both of the Anteaters’ shots were on goal.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior defender Sydney Fuertes and Magnin took the most shots for their team with three each. Senior midfielder Ashley Dean and sophomore midfielder Mallory Hromatko each had two.</p>\n<p>“We would love to be as high a seed in our tournament as possible, but we have to win two very tough games late in the season to continue on to the NCAA Tournament, which is one of our final goals for the year,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have just two more games remaining on their regular season and conference schedule. On Thursday, Oct. 27, UCSB will take on the UC Davis Aggies at 7 p.m and will then face the Long Beach State 49ers on Sunday, Oct. 30 at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In the biggest rivalry in college soccer, the Big West-leading Gaucho men’s soccer team hosted northern neighbor Cal Poly with the chance to clinch the Big West North by sending the visitors home with their second Blue-Green loss in as many weeks. The home fans were rocking, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find a winning goal as the game played out to a 0-0 stalemate following overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains atop the North division with the result at 5-0-3 in Big West play, 9-5-3 overall, five points clear of second-place Sac State, and although the home side failed to clinch the North with a win over the Mustangs, a tie in either of SB’s last two regular season games would essentially clinch the title. As for the Mustangs, the tie leaves the squad at the bottom of the division at 1-5-2 in conference play while standing them at 3-9-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The 11,424 in attendance at Harder made up the largest crowd in the country this season for a men’s soccer game, and the rivalry is now responsible for drawing 15 of the 20 largest regular season crowds in NCAA soccer. Early on, the atmosphere was deafening, students packing the main grandstand to the brim, but as the game played out, both teams settled into what would become a dirty, defensive battle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors seemed to have opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Cal Poly senior defender Kody Wakasa directed the ball past freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux with his right hand and was shown the match’s first yellow for the blatant hand ball.</p>\n<p>After that, the Gauchos were able to create several chances through crosses from the wingers and fullbacks, coming closest in the 22nd minute as senior striker Nick DePuy smashed his towering header off the crossbar and back into play, but no teammates were around before the Mustang defense was able to clear their line.</p>\n<p>The All-American striker was hugely involved in his team’s best chances, including a team-high five shots. Despite his recent scoring troubles, DePuy has been doing everything to get on the scoresheet and is tied for second on the team with six goals this year. His recent dry spell — one goal in last seven matches — even left his teammates and coaches wishing a bit of luck on the frontman.</p>\n<p>“The streak is at eight now. Nick’s hit the post on a header in eight straight games and he did it again tonight,” said Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg half-jokingly. “He’s still getting up and battling for that ball, but it’s just one of those unlucky streaks where he keeps finding the post, and tonight that’s the goal that opens up the whole game. Unfortunate, but Nick played very, very well tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB dominated the match, holding Cal Poly to just one shot in each half, but the Gaucho attack failed to find a goal as it pressed on in the second half and overtime. The Mustangs stacked all but one man behind the ball for the last forty minutes, including OT. Santa Barbara outshot the visitors 10-2, but were ultimately held scoreless for the first time in eleven games.</p>\n<p>The meeting was highly contested with 35 total fouls, and each team had at least two valid penalty claims that were waived on by the referee. In the postgame press conference, Vom Steeg said the allowance of overly physical play made it too difficult for either team to score, and ultimately Poly stayed resolute in the back, earning a tie at Harder for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to generate an attack when they can physically hold you back,” said Vom Steeg. “Nick played great tonight considering its two arms around his waist wrapped up so you can’t get free. You can’t get open in that box because at some point you realize there won’t be a call.”</p>\n<p>Having just beaten Cal Poly on the road last weekend, SB planned on wearing out the Mustangs and taking the game late, and while the coaching staff must have been pleased with how their game plan played out, the offense couldn’t find the moment it needed to break the deadlock. A win would’ve clinched the Big West North for the reigning division champs, but the Gauchos were unable to find the winner and are now forced to grab a positive result this week in order to lock up at least one home game for conference playoffs.</p>\n<p>“It would’ve been nice to get the title in front of the crowd, but the team played really well,” said junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who leads UCSB with 10 goals. “If you play five more minutes we find the goal. At the end they were split up and sliding all over the field, so if we had one final shot, one final pass, we could’ve got the win.”</p>\n<p>The biggest crowd of the year brought an electric energy to the rivalry match, but the game never opened up enough to do the nationally-televised meeting justice, as both teams locked up the opposing attackers and played out the Blue-Green rivalry’s first scoreless draw since 2009.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SCENES IN THE 15th MINUTE 0-0 STILL IN THE BLUE/GREEN RIVALRY <a href=\"https://t.co/EU178e6k3G\">pic.twitter.com/EU178e6k3G</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus Sports (@thenexus_sports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/790030498114392064\">October 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at Sac St. on Wednesday, October 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/","id":1401,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1400,1399,1398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Settling In: Gaucho Freshmen Class Solidifies International Flair","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There are a total of 29 international student athletes from every corner of the globe playing Big West soccer, and UCSB has nine, tied for the most in the conference with CSUN.

The heavily international roster creates a dynamic that most other collegiate programs are never exposed to.</p>\n<p>When high school seniors commit their futures to college programs, they look for places that promote a preferred style of play or mentality, and it seems that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has fostered an environment that looks extremely appealing to kids from overseas. Six of the nine freshmen on the current Gaucho roster joined from a range of nations outside the United States.</p>\n<p>Just this week, four of the first-year internationals were listed to the TopDrawerSoccers.com midseason Top-200 Freshman list. Midfielder Daniel Amo (Ghana), fullback Mateo Restrepo Mejia (Canada), winger Noah Billingsley (New Zealand) and goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux (France) are the quartet of top prospects. Amo is the highest ranked at No. 20 on the list and the other three all have experience in the youth setups of their respective national teams.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_73428\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73428\" data-attachment-id=\"73428\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/titouan-le-roux-clears-the-ball-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-3-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Titouan Le Roux clears the ball.

Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Apart from Amo, who suffered a groin injury early in the season that has kept him out for four weeks, the other three have locked down spots in Vom Steeg’s main starting nine, quickly adapting to life in Santa Barbara on and off the pitch.</p>\n<p>Le Roux and Mejia have been crucial staples in a shifting defense, with the keeper having started every match without sitting out a minute all year. Mejia has started five matches, but has appeared in every game, serving in countless crosses in his wing-back role.</p>\n<p>“When I came here it was with the objective of playing, so I was ready to play and ready to do everything,” Le Roux said. “It’s my job to play, so I’m glad to be the starting goalkeeper, and I want to keep playing so I keep trying to do my best to keep playing.”</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who played at the U-20s World Cup two years ago for the New Zealand side, has become a key piece of UCSB’s marauding attack, with two goals and two assists.<br>\nTo the credit of his growth over the year, the winger’s dribbling and passing behind striker Nick DePuy has been increasingly noticeable as the year goes on as he grows into his starting role.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73431\" style=\"width: 569px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73431\" data-attachment-id=\"73431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73431\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=559%2C374\" alt=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" width=\"559\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Amo’s injury forced him to endure a testing month of recovery as the promising midfielder eagerly worked his way back into training. His rehab has almost paid its dividends as he prepares to make a brief cameo in Saturday’s home leg of the Blue-Green rivalry.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating and it hurts, but, I mean, it’s part of the game. But my teammates were right there, very supportive, so I never thought ‘I’m done,’” Amo said. ”They were always there reminding me, like, ‘Oh, you gotta go to rehab.’ The guys were all supportive, so it made it — I wouldn’t say okay because it’s still an injury — but they made it comfortable to be around and go to the games.”</p>\n<p>In his time out, the Accra, Ghana native credited the team’s welcoming and supportive team spirit with helping him through the recovery process. One teammate Amo thanked specifically was senior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who was recovering from a long-term injury alongside him.</p>\n<p>The two spent hours in the gym together fighting back to full strength, and now that both players are back in the rotation, Amo and Kim will get to play together for the first time at some point during the last few games of conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to see Seo get ready to play because when I got here I didn’t get to see him play, so I wanted to see him play,” Amo said. “He had a lot of sessions with me and I was like, ‘Oh my god, I want to see Seo play.’ This weekend at Cal Poly we were just knocking the ball around and it made me so excited to have him on the field.”</p>\n<p>The relationship between the Ghanaian and Kim, a midfielder born in South Korea before moving to the States, goes to show how UCSB’s soccer program has become a place for multicultural interaction with one of the most diverse squads in the country.</p>\n<p>It’s become a place where student-athletes from every possible background get to collaborate, and Billingsley commented on how joining up with players from so many cultures even shows in the way the Gauchos play.</p>\n<p>“Almost half of our team are from other places in the world, so everyone gets along and there’s no cliques, which is nice,” Billingsley explained. “Everyone is used to a different style of play and comes from different backgrounds, and I think the chemistry is just right, and that alone has won us a couple of games.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s style of play, a high-pressing 4-3-3 with attacking wing backs, has allowed the German midfielder Kevin Feucht to shine this season — the junior leads the Big West with 10 goals — as the focal point of the Gauchos’ exciting offense that allows the creative players to express themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the influence of already having upperclassmen foreign players on the team helping the younger guys adapt to the new pressures of college life and finding resources on campus, it’s clear how much these international athletes stick together.</p>\n<p>Le Roux mentioned the helpfulness of his teammates as he struggled with people “speaking too quick for me,” and the assistance extended to basic tasks associated with moving somewhere new.</p>\n<p>“The older guys know about stuff we have to go through, like getting a new phone plan and bank account and that sort of stuff, and then all the other things like being away from home; it’s really nice to have people there whenever I need to talk about something,” Billingsley said.</p>\n<p>The benefits of a multicultural presence extend beyond the lines of the field as players learn about and compare their teammates’ ways of life with one another.</p>\n<p>The Harder Stadium melting pot is a rare occurrence in college sports, and it is a premier example of the intrigue of diversity in soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Davis dominated most of the first half and held firmly onto their lead going into the break as Santa Barbara was unable to create any real opportunities.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the second half, though, UCSB’s feared offense was back to its normal self, creating a couple of close chances before junior forward Ahinga Selemani chipped a ball to the back post for junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who headed the ball down for the equalizer, adding the tenth goal to his conference-leading tally. The German now also climbs to seventh in the national goal-scoring leaderboards.</p>\n<p>Although Selemani’s four-game scoring streak snapped in the win, he still managed to come up with the same opportunistic play that has made him such a threat up front this season by winning the ball off a missed clearance and finally cracking open the airtight UCD defense.</p>\n<p>After the leveling goal, both teams settled down and mostly waited for overtime, making several defensive substitutions and deciding against creating too many chances at the risk of conceding on the counter. In the extra period, though, the Gauchos brought on plenty of attacking force, and their forward efforts were rewarded almost immediately in the 92nd minute when DePuy finally got back on the score sheet.</p>\n<p>Sophomore defender Dalton Pando sent a long ball in behind the Aggie defensive line, where DePuy brought it down, smoothly beating his man before firing home his sixth of the season to tie Selemani for second on the team. Funnily enough, the OT winner fulfilled team-leader Feucht’s prophecy when he guaranteed a goal from his struggling frontman in their next match following last Saturday’s win against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The win continued the hot streak the Gauchos have been on since conference has begun, and the team now rides their seven-game unbeaten run — their longest in three seasons — into the home clash with Cal Poly on Saturday. UCSB will be hoping to win both legs of the Blue-Green rivalry as well as avenge the last-second goal the Mustangs scored to tie it up before holding onto the 2-2 result in overtime when they travelled to Harder last year.</p>\n<p>That match will be played Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium, with a chance to sell out the 17,000 seat stadium for the biggest rivalry in college soccer. The game will be televised on Fox Sports, and admission is free with an ACCESS card.

Harder Stadium against Cal Poly in the second meeting of the annual Blue-Green clash. Fresh off a comeback victory against UC Davis this Wednesday and having already beaten the Mustangs once this season, the gauchos are in a great position for the weekend to come.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host their bitter, green rival boasting a solid 9-5-2 overall record and an unbeaten 5-0-2 Big West record, good enough for first place in the entire conference with 14 total points. Cal Poly comes into town with a deflating 3-9-2 overall record and a 1-5-1 conference record placing them dead last in the entire Big West with four points.</p>\n<p>For the second straight week, these two teams will meet on Saturday night in front of an exuberant home crowd. After falling behind 1-0 early in the match just five days ago, Santa Barbara stormed back with goals from red-hot juniors Ahinga Selemani and Kevin Feucht to win the game 2-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The victory put the all-time record between these two squads at an even further distance as the Gauchos now lead the series all-time 46-18-8 and 23-7-6 during the Tim Vom Steeg era. The win was also a huge confidence boost as last year UCSB was winless in the two-match series going 0-1-1.</p>\n<p>Last season’s match at Harder Stadium was certainly an instant classic. The game attracted 14,919 spectators, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history, and ended in a stunning 2-2 tie after Cal Poly scored the equalizer with only four seconds left, overcoming what seemed to be an insurmountable 2-0 lead held by the home team for most of the match.</p>\n<p>With that being the lasting moment the remaining Gauchos had of the match against the Mustangs last year, it’s safe to say they are ready to come out and defeat them in front of what could be the largest crowd in NCAA history by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Also on the line, Santa Barbara’s chance to sweep Cal Poly for the first time since 2006. That year also marked UCSB’s first and only national championship in program history.</p>\n<p>Hoping to deflate the home team and give them their first loss of the conference season will be senior forward Justin Dhillon who ranks third in the conference in goals scored with seven. The winger has scored 70 percent of the team’s total goals all season. His 17 total points also rank him first on his team, third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite his great offense play, no other Mustang really comes to mind. Despite not scoring in last week’s match, the senior assisted in the only goal scored by Cal Poly in that game as freshman midfielder Christian Enriquez scored the first goal of his young career.</p>\n<p>One player to watch out for is Kody Wakasa. The senior defender made the shot of his life last season for his team scoring the game winning golden goal against the Gauchos in a 3-2 win at Cal Poly. This season Wakasa has registered one goal and has played exceptional in the back end, which has done a solid job despite what the overall record might entail.</p>\n<p>In fact, goalkeeper Eric Kam has been great for most of the season. The junior has the second-best goals allowed against average in the Big West with 1.21, while his save percentage of .706 ranks fourth in the conference with UCSB’s freshman goalie Tituoan Le Roux.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been on fire as of late, especially the trio of DePuy, Selemani and Feucht. All three players are in the top-five goal scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Feucht’s 10 goals rank first in the conference while also ranking seventh best in the entire nation. The midfielder scored the equalizer to help send the game into overtime against UC Davis on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Because of the Feucht’s goal, DePuy was able to score the 16th game winner of his career in front of the Aggies home stadium. Despite not having the season he had last year when he scored 15 goals and led the entire nation, the striker has still made a significant impact. In his career, the senior has scored four goals in seven appearances against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least on the list, is Selemani. Although not extending his goal streak to five matches after failing to score against UC Davis, the junior had the key assist to Feucht’s equalizer. In two of his three career appearances against Cal Poly, the junior has scored a goal and his six goals this season rank second best on the team, tied with DePuy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73271\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73271\" data-attachment-id=\"73271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-19/gauchos-head-to-uc-davis-to-continue-recent-unbeaten-run/jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73271\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=323%2C485\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"323\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On the back end, the Gauchos have been solid thanks to the play of freshman Le Roux. The goalkeeper ranks third in the conference with 60 saves and has not allowed more than one goal in his last six matches; he is a respectable player, having done all this without missing a single minute in 16 starts this season.</p>\n<p>While, on paper, Santa Barbara clearly looks like the more dominant team, Cal Poly certainly has the tenacity to make this an interesting match. If last Saturday’s match was any indicator, the Gauchos might have their hands full this weekend if they are not careful.</p>\n<p>As recognized by most fans of college soccer, the Blue-Green clash is the best soccer rivalry in college soccer to date, and with that title comes the responsibility to give fans the greatest game they could possibly witness. Something tells me this match, like all the others that have been played, will not disappoint.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against the Mustangs in the annual Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. at Harder Stadium. The game will also be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Cheers for goals scored and jeers for penalties missed echo across the field, the voices of thousands of students, family members, alumni and fans all coming together.</p>\n<p>This reality reflects the historical rivalry between UCSB and Cal Poly in the sport of men’s soccer. Better known as the Blue-Green rivalry, it is a rivalry that has emerged as the nation’s most prolific duel to date.</p>\n<p>Ranked as the No. 1 rivalry on <em>CollegeSoccerNews.com’s</em> list of “The Fourteen Greatest Rivalries in College Soccer,” the meeting between the Gauchos and Mustangs has continued to meet the expectations and anticipation of audiences nationwide.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With both programs being members of the Big West North Division, the storied matchup is an annual battle that takes place twice a year, giving fans the opportunity to brag and express pride in supporting the Gauchos or Mustangs.</p>\n<p>A match full of intensity and high emotion, goals are a rarity that take much effort, as 16 of the last 19 matches between UCSB and Cal Poly have been decided by one goal or have resulted in a draw.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been UCSB with the advantage over Cal Poly. The Gauchos’ all-time record when facing their Central Coast rival is 46-18-8 after a recent 2-1 defeat of the Mustangs last Saturday while on the road in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In his 18th season with UCSB, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg owns a 23-7-6 record when facing the Mustangs. It has been nearly two decades since his takeover of the Gauchos’ sideline, yet no introduction to the Blue-Green rivalry was needed for Vom Steeg in his transition to the helm as he was a student and soccer player at UCSB from 1985-1988.</p>\n<p>While the rivalry is one that expands across generations of athletes, students and fans, the classic match has consistently increased in popularity on a national scale.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the 2007 season, the total amount of people that have witnessed the Gaucho-Mustang battle exceeds the 200,000 mark.</p>\n<p>The contest has even surpassed the attendance numbers of postseason competition that has occurred in both NCAA Tournament and College Cup games, resulting in eight of the highest attended collegiate games in the U.S. in the last four years.</p>\n<p>Although on the road, last Saturday’s attendance of 11,075 signaled the seventh sellout for a Cal Poly men’s soccer game in program history. It is a game that has sold out Alex G. Spanos Stadium for the past six seasons.</p>\n<p>Increasing in size with the addition of 1,097 attendees, the attendance of the last five meetings between UCSB and Cal Poly — dating back to 2011-2015 — has not fell below the total of 12,805.</p>\n<p>Well deserving of its moniker as the “Soccer Heaven” of collegiate soccer, Harder Stadium has been a hub to the multitude of attendance records set over the years.</p>\n<p>Over the course of nine straight years, UCSB has led Division I men’s soccer in average attendance. For the last two seasons, it has recorded the top average of 3,844 fans per match. The Gauchos’ 5,873 attendees per match in 2010 remains the highest average since the NCAA began accounting for the statistical category in 1998.</p>\n<p>Last season’s two meetings concluded with single-game attendance highs for both programs as they were the only two schools to reach tens of thousands.</p>\n<p>The total of 14,919 fans that attended the second matchup between the Gauchos and Mustangs at Harder Stadium ranked above all games on the list. Following was the first game of the 2015-2016 Blue-Green series in which 11,075 people were in attendance.</p>\n<p>Since the reinstatement of men’s soccer into the Big West Conference in 2001, the Blue-Green bout has gradually grown each year as the purpose of the rivalry has extended beyond the field, becoming a ritual amongst both universities. The Blue-Green game is the only exception in which students are allowed to storm the field at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The legend of the Blue-Green rivalry continues this Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. and will be nationally televised by Fox Sports Prime Ticket for the fourth consecutive year.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/","id":1428,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1427,1426,1425],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
