I thought he had as good a year as you could have in the conference.”</p>\n<p>In his final year with UCSB, the senior posted a team high of eight goals. He tied for third in the Big West in points with 19 and ranked fourth in game-winning goals in the conference with four.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“He carried the team,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “No matter how many games you play, it all comes down to who scores and who wins the game. Losing our forwards, it was huge to have someone to score goals for us.”</p>\n<p>Ryan seemed to come up with a goal whenever his team needed one. Against Cal Poly Oct. 19, he scored what may have been the most beautiful goal of the year for UCSB when he converted a diving header sent into the box from freshman midfielder Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>He even single-handedly kept the Gauchos in the game on multiple occasions. Most notably, he scored both of UCSB’s goals in a 2-1 decision against UC Irvine Oct. 5, the second goal coming in double overtime with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Every goal he got was a key goal at a key moment,” Vom Steeg said. “You can’t ask for much more than what he gave us. I feel bad that we weren’t able to do enough to send [our seniors] off in a different away.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the San Jose native seemed to fly under the radar with the hype of the team centering on flashy players such as Boateng or senior midfielder Dion Acoff, who dazzled fans with their speed and footwork.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s not the type of player Ryan is; he’s a player who effectively gets the job done. He knows where to be on the field, and most importantly, how to finish in front of the goal.</p>\n<p>“He understands the game really well and he knows where to be at the right time,” Baiden said. “It allowed him to get involved more and get himself in places that would score.”</p>\n<p>Despite being a player who hasn’t received a ton of publicity or made people talk, Ryan was recognized in a big way when he received the Big West Midfielder of the Year award last week.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to get an award after a difficult season,” Ryan said. “It was definitely one of my goals to try to be the best midfielder out there and getting it felt like a [big] accomplishment. It’s definitely a big award, and I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p>One of two players to play in every game this year for UCSB, Ryan tallied five goals and two assists during Big West play en route to his first All-Big West honor of his career.</p>\n<p>“In order to win that award, you have to play through the midfield, and we do that,” Vom Steeg said. “We ask them to be on the ball, and as a result, we allow them to really demonstrate what they can do. He seized the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Ryan keeps the Midfielder of the Year award in the family as he is the fourth consecutive Gaucho to win it. Danny Barrera took the honor in 2009-10 and Luis Silva won it last year.</p>\n<p>In fact, playing behind players such as Barrera, Silva and Sam Garza in the first three years of his career might be the reason you had never really heard Ryan’s name before.</p>\n<p>“I had really good players in front of me like Silva and Danny, so I had to let them do their thing,” Ryan said. “They had a lot of success. I knew I could have that role.”</p>\n<p>This year, the team needed somebody to step up and take the role of that dominant midfielder. It was a role Ryan wanted and took into his own hands.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a change in mentality,” Ryan said. “I wanted to be that player to get the goal or the assist. This year, I felt like I was the guy — that one midfielder — that had to score for us to win.”</p>\n<p>This year, Ryan took 26 shots, 11 more than he took in his first three years combined. His 19 points are also exceptionally greater than his contribution in the first three years when he tallied just five points, including two goals.</p>\n<p>“He played with a lot of confidence this year,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s the most dramatic change from last year. Once we started to lose our forwards, he took it upon himself to score. I think there was a lot of leadership too. Even though he doesn’t scream and yell, he demanded the ball and stepped up his play in the bigger games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also made a tactical change, moving Ryan into a central midfield position this year. The position was better suited for Ryan than his original outside mid position and gave him more scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Before I got to UCSB, I always played attacking mid, so I was comfortable with that role,” Ryan said. “Usually on the outside, you concentrate on getting the cross off and since I was in the middle [this year], I was in the box and receiving the ball at the end of the cross.”</p>\n<p>Now, Ryan’s season and career as a Gaucho are done. But like the great players who played at UCSB before him, there may be a spot for him at the pro level.</p>\n<p>For Ryan, going pro has been a lifelong dream. He’s strived for this goal all his life, as his dad was a professional soccer player (a midfielder) for the San Jose Earthquakes. At UCSB, Ryan wore No. 14, just like his dad.</p>\n<p>“[My dad’s] probably been the number one influence soccer-wise that I’ve had in my life,” Ryan said. “He brought me up with the game. He was always my coach until I went to UCSB. I [went] to his games and [grew] up with his soccer friends and [watched] soccer with him all the time. He took a lot of time out of his day to help me develop as a player, so I owe a lot to him.”</p>\n<p>The next step for Ryan will be receiving an invitation to the MLS combine, where coaches will take a look at the college seniors. To get drafted, participating in this combine is a must.</p>\n<p>“You would hope as the midfielder of the year he can get that invitation,” Vom Steeg said. “I definitely think he can play at the next level. He makes good decisions on the ball and he’s good around the net, so I think Nic can help a team at the next level; but it’s whether somebody can appreciate that, because he’s not a player that will make an incredible move and make people go ‘wow.’ Because of him, though, your team will play better.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

His first All-Big West honor of his career, Ryan is the third consecutive Gaucho to earn the award.</p>\n<p>Ryan tied for third in both goals and points, tallying eight goals and three assists for 19 points on the year, 12 of which came during Big West play. Ryan also ranked fourth in conference in game-winning goals with four.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely happy that Nic Ryan, a player who hasn’t gotten a whole lot of publicity and not a whole lot of people have talked about him, got Midfielder of the Year,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Ema Boateng took the Big West Freshman of the Year award after posting four goals and four assists, becoming the third player in the last four years to win the award for the Gauchos. He also tied for fifth in the Big West in game- winning goals with two.</p>\n<p>“We always knew that Ema was going to win the award,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Usually freshmen don’t step in right away, but he helped us both offensively and defensively.”</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos made the All-Big West First Team: Ryan, Boateng and Baiden. Baiden started 17 of 19 games en route to his first league honor of his career. Playing a defensive mid, Baiden’s contributions may not show up in the box scores, but he was indispensable to UCSB, controlling the midfield, aiding the UCSB defense and allowing other players to push up.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Baiden] was our most consistent player all year,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s the one that makes things go for us, so it’s good that others recognized that he had a good season.”</p>\n<p>In his first year with UCSB, junior defender Daniel Welsh earned All-Big West Second Team honors. He started 17 games and was often responsible for guarding the opponent’s best attacker. With Welsh, the Gauchos tallied an impressive 0.90 goals- against average and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting he got Second Team,” Baiden said. “I thought we would make First Team, but it’s a new conference for him and he made his mark as a good defender. I see him being the defender of the year next year.”</p>\n<p>Finally, senior midfielder Josue Madueno earned an Honorable Mention pick for the second straight season. Madueno was just one of two players to play in every game this season and stepped up big when UCSB was plagued with injuries.</p>\n<p>“I think Josue deserved a little more,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a great team guy and he played wherever we needed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 15, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/","id":1618,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1617,1616,1615],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Season Finale to Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A tough season for the UCSB men’s soccer team didn’t end any better as the team dropped its final game of the season 1-0 to Cal Poly.

They didn’t pressure the Gaucho defense but controlled the tempo, making the match a possession game.</p>\n<p>“They had like 10 guys behind the ball, and whenever we got a ball, they made sure everyone dropped back,” Baiden said. “They needed a tie or win for them to go to [playoffs], so why risk it?”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs continued to control the ball in the second half, dominating UCSB. They kept the ball on the Gauchos’ half of the field, which finally resulted in a goal.</p>\n<p>In the 77th minute, redshirt junior midfielder Mike Hocker chipped a ball from midfield into UCSB’s penalty area. Sophomore goalkeeper Austin Mansker came off his line but could not control the ball, leaving a wide open net. Senior midfielder Chris Gaschen ran down the ball and passed it to junior midfielder George Malki, who shot across the six-yard box and into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“It was an easy ball for Austin to get and I don’t know what happened, but he dropped it and one of their players picked it up,” Baiden said. “It was a goal that came from nowhere.”</p>\n<p>The goal was Malki’s fourth of the season and second against the Gauchos this year. He also scored the equalizer with just over a minute remaining in regulation at Harder Stadium nearly two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>“He’s always in the right spot at the right time,” Baiden said. “He’s a good player, but he’s scored both goals on a scramble.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was outshot 10-6, including 3-1 on shots-on-goal, marking only the second time this season the Gauchos took fewer shots than their opponent. The second half was the difference, as Santa Barbara took just one shot in the second half, compared to Cal Poly’s six. The Gauchos’ lone shot on goal came in the first half on a shot from senior forward Dion Acoff in the seventh minute.</p>\n<p>“We knew we weren’t going to have that many chances,” Ryan said. “We knew we were going to have to capitalize on our opportunities and unfortunately, we were unable to.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/ucsb-drops-season-finale-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/ucsb-drops-season-finale-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/ucsb-drops-season-finale-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/ucsb-drops-season-finale-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/ucsb-drops-season-finale-cal-poly/","id":1619,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1618,1617,1616],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seeking Revenge in SLO","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s soccer team will play its final game of the season Saturday when the team travels to Cal Poly for a blue-green rivalry match- up.At 10-5-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, the Gauch...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s soccer team will play its final game of the season Saturday when the team travels to Cal Poly for a blue-green rivalry match-</p>\n<p>up.At 10-5-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, the Gauchos are in last place in the North Division and will miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 seasons.

Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6-1 overall and a 5-3-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in this league,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We’re going to go in confident. Ideally, it’d be great to go out of there with a win, but [they’ve] got their season on the line and they should be ready to go at home.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge a 2-1 overtime loss at home against the Mustangs that should have been a win for UCSB. With a 1-0 lead off an incredible diving header from Ryan, Santa Barbara got caught in bad positioning and gave up a goal with just over a minute remaining in regulation. Cal Poly then prevailed on a golden goal in overtime. “We have to get them back at home,” Baiden said. “We’re going there for one purpose: to beat Cal Poly. We have to win to get revenge because we don’t like what they did to us, beating us at home.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to keep a closer eye on junior forward McKenzie Pridham, who tallied the golden goal, as well as an assist, in the last matchup. Pridham is Cal Poly’s primary offensive force and one of the best forwards in the Big West, ranking second in the league in points with 11 goals and an assist. He also ranks first in the Big West in game winning goals with six.</p>\n<p>“Now we have [junior defender Peter] Schmetz back and that’s huge,” Baiden said. “Any balls going over our heads, he can win. We have to keep an eye on McKenzie and make sure he doesn’t get any chances.” Leading the attack for the Gauchos will be Ryan. Ryan has had a great senior season for UCSB, leading the team in goals with eight. He also ranks third in the conference in game-winning goals with four.</p>\n<p>“Knowing it’s going to be his last game, I think [Ryan will] come out really strong,” Baiden said. “He’s playing really, really well for us this season. [He has been] huge for our team.”</p>\n<p>Another focus for UCSB will be consistent play. In the last few games, the Gauchos have often given up leads in the last few minutes of the game or early into overtime. Santa Barbara will need a full 90 minutes to find victory on the road.</p>\n<p>“Besides Sac State, overtime and losing the game in the</p>\n<p>last couple seconds have killed us,” Ryan said. “So we know we have to go out and play a full 90 minutes. Most teams score on us in the last few minutes of the first or second half. To beat Cal Poly, we have to play a complete game.”</p>\n<p>Finally, the shot count will be a key statistic for UCSB, which has found more success when the team gets forward and takes more shots. The team leads the Big West in shots with 17.56 per game and took 24 in the last game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“The more shots you take, the more chances you have to get a goal,” Baiden said. “We have to keep shooting, but we have to make sure they’re on frame. Even if the goalie stops it, you can get a rebound.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Alex G.

Senior midfielder Dion Acoff was pulled down in the box, resulting in a penalty kick for the Gauchos. Freshman midfielder Ema</p>\n<p>Boateng stepped up to take the kick, but the shot was saved by senior goalkeeper Bryan Oliver. Oliver currently leads the Big West in saves with 6.2 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Oliver] guessed it right,” Baiden said. “Before [Boateng] was going to take it, he had to stand there for a long time. He hit it well, but the goalie guessed it.”</p>\n<p>With the game still tied, UCSB received a break in the 19th minute when senior defender Matt Linenberger received a red card for arguing with the official, giving the Gauchos a one man advantage the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Cesar Castillo took the free kick from about 25 yards out, which was saved by Oliver. When Oliver landed, however, both he and the ball were across the goal line, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead in the 20th minute. The goal was Castillo’s first of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was a good shot,” Baiden said. “I think the goalie was expecting him to cross it and he just went for it.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing a man down, the Hornets equalized in the 39th minute on a defensive breakdown at midfield by the Gauchos. Junior defender Matthew Glodack passed the ball back to sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, but left the pass short. Sophomore forward Chimdum Mez picked up the pass, and with a one v. one with Mansker, fired a shot from just outside the 18-yard box. Mansker left his line to cut off the angle, but had no chance of saving Mez’s shot, which tied the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>“It was one of those games [just like] we’ve seen before [where] we’ve been up and we give up an easy goal,” Ryan said. “It was devastating, but we’ve been talking about how we need to let those things go. I thought we dominated the rest of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB regained the lead in the 55th minute when Glodack sent a beautiful pass into the box, which was headed into the back of the net by freshman forward Charlie Miller.</p>\n<p>“The second goal was huge,” Baiden said. “In all the games we’ve played, we get in front and then we’re tied and we end up losing.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in past games where Santa Barbara relinquished its lead late, UCSB held on to its 2-1 lead for the victory, snapping a three game losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays its final game of the season Saturday at Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/ucsb-snaps-threegame-losing-streak/","id":1617,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1616,1615,1614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"McGlynn Charged With Battery Misdemeanor","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/THE-SHOVE-OF-DEATH_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/THE-SHOVE-OF-DEATH_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After Sunday’s incident following the UC Davis game in which UCSB’s Peter McGlynn pushed the referee, the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s office decided to press charges against McGlynn Tuesda...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After Sunday’s incident following the UC Davis game in which UCSB’s Peter McGlynn pushed the referee, the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s office decided to press charges against McGlynn Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>McGlynn has been charged with a misdemeanor of battery against a sports official after he knocked referee Reed Christy to the ground with a two- handed shove.

My actions were completely my own and now I will accept the full consequences of the matter. Not only did I let myself and my family down, but also my team, the coaching staff, the athletic department, UCSB, the alumni, and everybody from the Santa Barbara community, and I would want to say to all involved of how very sorry I am.”</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the next step for McGlynn will be going to court, which should happen in the next couple weeks.</p>\n<p>“He’ll have to go to court to officially hear the charges against him and have him put a plea in of guilty or not guilty,” Romero said. “If he does decide to say he’s not guilty, then he will probably have to set up another court date with a hearing to see if there’s enough evidence to sustain a charge. If the court decides there is enough evidence, then they’ll set a trial date. Then again, all this could be handled outside the courtroom too. It’s all on how Mr. McGlynn answers to the charges.”</p>\n<p>According to Romero, a negotiation could be settled if McGlynn decides to plead guilty or no contest.</p>\n<p>“If he decided to plead guilty or no contest, there would have to be some type of negotiation between the district attorneys, and then probation and him deciding what type of punishment, if any, he would have to answer to,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, USCB athletic director Mark Massari announced McGlynn’s removal from the team. He has also been completely removed from the UCSB website. In addition, Massari also announced UCSB would forego any postseason opportunity, although it turns out UCSB would not have made the playoffs regardless. Vom Steeg was also suspended from yesterday’s game at Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>“There’s a line,” Vom Steeg said after the game. “You can be upset and scream and yell and be frustrated. We all were, but nobody else on the team went [to McGlynn’s level].”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/","id":1614,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1613,1612,1611],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Out of Playoffs, UCSB Travels North","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s soccer team hopes to rebound from three consecutive overtime losses when the team takes on Sacramento State in its second to last game of the season tonight.

UCSB currently leads the Big West in shots with 17.65 per game while the Hornets are last with just 11.44 per game.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara ranks last in the league in goals during conference play with just 1.12 per game, so UCSB will need to take advantage of its chances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos certainly executed offensively in their last matchup against Sac State, scoring two goals on 23 shots. The goals came less than eight minutes into the game and just 12 seconds apart.</p>\n<p>“That game, we came out with a lot of energy and if we want the same result, we have to work hard and put some balls on frame,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.</p>\n<p>Scoring one of those goals was Ryan, who currently ranks fourth in the Big West in points with eight goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Hornets are a trio of players in senior midfielder Chris Sandoval, junior midfielder Gabe Silveira and junior forward Isaac Ikyurav. Silveira and Ikyurav have each scored five goals on the year while Sandoval has contributed four. The trio has also tallied nine assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to be compact and aware,” Ryan said. “We have to play both sides of the ball: offense and defense.”</p>\n<p>While both teams have dangerous attackers, UCSB and Sac State also feature the two best goalkeepers in the Big West. The Gauchos’ Austin Mansker leads the conference in goals against average at .88. On the other hand, Sacramento’s Bryan Oliver leads the league in save percentage and saves with 81.6 percent and 6.2, respectively.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game against Sacramento State is set for 7 p.m. at Hornet Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48510\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48510\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/playoffs-ucsb-travels-north/","id":1615,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1614,1613,1612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"McGlynn Removed from Team","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mcglynn.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mcglynn.jpg?resize=500%2C320&ssl=1","description":"After senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed down a referee at the conclusion of the UCSB men’s soccer game against UC Davis Sunday, UCSB Athletic Director Mark Massari announced today that McGlynn ha...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed down a referee at the conclusion of the UCSB men’s soccer game against UC Davis Sunday, UCSB Athletic Director Mark Massari announced today that McGlynn has been removed from the team.</p>\n<p>The incident began with the Gauchos believing sophomore keeper Austin Mansker was fouled on the play that led to the Aggies golden goal in a must-win game that nearly eliminated Santa Barbara from the Big West playoffs.</p>\n<p>Players and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg unsuccessfully begged the ref for a call.

The loss marked the first time in program history that the Aggies have beaten the Gauchos twice in a single season. It was also the fifth loss in the last six games for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With the pair of losses, Santa Barbara drops to 9-5-3 overall and 3-4-1 in the Big West. Six points out of playoff contention with only two games remaining, UCSB’s chances of making playoffs are extremely slim. Davis, on the other hand, takes control of first place, improving to 8-5-4 overall and 6-2 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s hard,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We’ve got a couple games left, but I don’t think we’re going to make the Big West tournament because of this and that was our goal for the year, so we feel like we’ve failed.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked like the better team the entire game and were extremely dangerous from the start, outshooting the Aggies 26 to 11.</p>\n<p>“Every game we play, it’s the same story,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “No matter how many shots you have, if you don’t put them on frame or put them in the back of the net, they don’t really count. We were hoping for that second goal, but we unfortunately didn’t get it.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, UCSB finally found the back of the net on a goal from senior forward Achille Campion, who was back in the lineup for the first time since Sept. 16 due to injury. UCSB exhibited beautiful passing with junior midfielder Goffin Boyoko receiving a ball streaking towards the endline, who passed it back to Ryan in the penalty box. Ryan then sent the ball square to freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, who flicked it to Campion. Campion converted for his sixth goal of the season and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a nice build up play,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s something we hadn’t seen and something we’ve been looking for as far as combination play. It was great.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to dominate the possession in the first half, but went into halftime tied at one apiece due to a goal by Davis with three seconds remaining in the first half. Davis sent a ball into the box, which was headed down by junior defender Peter Schmetz. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the header went off the heel of Boyoko and landed into feet of sophomore defender Ramon Martin del Campo, who passed the ball to sophomore forward Matt Sheldon. Sheldon sent the ball across the goal and past Mansker to equalize the game.</p>\n<p>“We kept saying, we’re due to catch a break…something has to go right,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s crazy. You’d think you’d get a break on something and we didn’t get one today. [The ball] can’t go off his heel and bounce up or go somewhere else?”</p>\n<p>Entering overtime deadlocked at one goal, Sheldon came up big once again for his team. On a long throw in by the Aggies, UCSB sophomore keeper Austin Mansker came out to grab the ball, but missed. Scrambling ensued in the box. Sheldon got a shot off, which was blocked by Schmetz on the goal line. However, Sheldon converted on the rebound.Sheldon led the Aggies offensively with the two goals on four shots.</p>\n<p>“They got a throw in, which is their best way of scoring,” Ryan said. “The ball rolled to one of their players and they put it in.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begged the referee for a foul call, claiming Mansker was pushed and that his arm was grabbed, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We like to control the result, but I feel the ref took that away from us,” Ryan said. “He called a lot in the box the whole game and to let guys go up like that and hit our keeper is totally on him.”</p>\n<p>As the team started to walk off the field, senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed the ref to the ground, earning himself a red card. He was escorted off the field by UCSB police, although Vom Steeg said the referee doesn’t plan on pressing charges.</p>\n<p>“When you say, ‘well I think everything could go wrong,’ now it has,” Vom Steeg said. “I didn’t see it coming. Obviously, [his season is] done. There are lines you don’t cross, and if you cross the line, the privilege to be a Division I college athlete is gone.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s non-conference match-up against Stanford, UCSB lost 1-0 on a golden goal in overtime, the team’s second consecutive loss in extra time. With the win, the Cardinal improve to 7-7-1.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of good things, but no one wanted to score,” Vom Steeg said. “We just didn’t put the ball in the back of the net and that’s the extent of it.”</p>\n<p>It took over 95 minutes for either team to score, with Stanford securing the win on a header from their leading scorer, Adam Jahn. Sophomore midfielder Jimmy Callinan sent a beautiful cross from about midfield into the box, which Jahn snapped into the back of the net, past sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, who had no chance of saving the shot. The goal was Jahn’s ninth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>“The only thing we discussed was the fact that the only way this team was going to score was if the ball goes wide and they cross it into the box,” Vom Steeg said. “They had two guys open on that last play, so that’s a breakdown.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos outshot the Cardinal 16-12, including 7-3 in the second half, but both team shot an even four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think we had a whole lot of chances, but we had some good ones that would’ve allowed us to score and take the game,” Baiden said. “We aren’t taking advantage of our opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s best opportunity came in the second half with just 21 seconds remaining in regulation when senior midfielder Dion Acoff dribbled down the left sideline before cutting in and taking a shot from the center of the 18 yard box.  Unfortunately for UCSB, the shot went wide left.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating because we do a lot of good things and I thought we got good performances from different players, but it’s the same repeating theme — nothing on frame,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos was McGlynn, who took three shots on the evening.  In the first half, McGlynn struck a bending ball from the right side of the box that had Stanford’s keeper beat, but rolled just wide of the post.</p>\n<p>“I thought he hit three really good shots,” Vom Steeg said. The one was very unlucky that it went just wide of the post.  McGlynn, right now, is one of our better players and he’s playing at a high level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the regular season next week with Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/","id":1612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1611,1610,1609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A late second half goal against the UCSB women’s soccer team brought a disappointing conclusion to the team’s season, as the Gauchos were unable to find the back of the net against rival Cal Poly ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A late second half goal against the UCSB women’s soccer team brought a disappointing conclusion to the team’s season, as the Gauchos were unable to find the back of the net against rival Cal Poly in their final game of the year yesterday afternoon and lost 1-0.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the statistics, it was a dead even statistical game, except for [the score],” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “This was one of the more complete performances by everybody; this was a game where so many people played well.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara finishes the year with a 5-12-2 overall record and 2-6-1 in conference.

The Cardinals are currently second in the Pac-12 in shots with 17.5 per game, although they only convert 1.36 goals per game. Leading the attack for Stanford is senior forward Adam Jahn with eight goals and two assists, good for second in the Pac-12. “He’s 6’3,’’ he’s active … he’s a good forward,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “He’s their go-to guy. If we want to not give up a goal, certainly keeping him from scoring will go a long way.”</p>\n<p>An offensively focused game may be exactly what UCSB needs. Struggling to score goals as of late, the Gauchos will look to take advantage of Stanford’s sub- par defense, which allows 1.43 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“This is a game for our offense. Right now, on offense, what we lack is confidence,” Baiden said. “We have to find a way to find the back of the net because that confidence will carry over to Davis and if we can get a couple early goals on Davis, [the game] will be over.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are currently in first place in the Big West with 15 points and have won five of their last six games. They hold a 7-5-4 overall and 5-2 conference record.</p>\n<p>“The game we absolutely have to win is on Sunday,” Vom Steeg said. “We will work hard to play a number of players on Friday night because I have to have a team that’s rested enough to play on Sunday. If we win on Friday and lose Sunday, it’s a bad weekend.”</p>\n<p>At Davis almost two weeks ago, the Gauchos lost 1-0. The Aggies were able to hold UCSB offensively and eventually found a goal in the 85th minute on a free kick.</p>\n<p>Each team only took nine shots, which is about eight shots below UCSB’s average of 17.2. Davis also outshot UCSB 4-3 in shots on goal in an offensive struggle for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to attack Davis,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to take 25 shots. I even told the guys I’d like the goal to be 30 shots. We have to be able to get goals.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game will feature the two best defenses in conference, with Santa Barbara ranking first in the Big West in goals against average at .82 and Davis ranking second at .95, scoring goals will be the ultimate priority for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a position where we have to take chances, take risks, be aggressive and do everything we can to find the back of the net,” Vom Steeg said. “That exposes you a little bit and you might give something in the back, but we have no choice.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday’s game against Stanford is set for 7 p.m. while Sunday’s game against Davis will start at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/desperation-time-playoffs-line/","id":1643,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1642,1641,1640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Rival Cal Poly in Last Match of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After two and a half months of disappointing but resilient play, the UCSB women’s soccer team will conclude its season this Sunday against rival Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.

UCSB was eliminated from the playoffs after losing to UC Riverside last Sunday. Meanwhile, with 17 points earned against conference opponents this season, the Mustangs are in first place in the league with an overall record of 8-6-3 and 5-1-2 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off its first conference loss against Cal State Fullerton and earning a draw against UCR, the Mustangs will try to rebound against the Gauchos. Despite being in first place, Cal Poly still has not mathematically qualified for a spot in the Big West Tournament and the Gauchos will look to play spoiler, as a loss could endanger the Mustang’s chances of competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“They do play a system where there are some pluses and minuses for us and against us, so we’re going to do everything we can to play to our strengths and avoid those weaknesses,”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It’d be great [to win]. They’re our closest rival, the schools are very similar — we recruit a lot of the same players. You always want to beat your cross town rival.”</p>\n<p>A huge reason Cal Poly is in position to capture its first Big West title since 2009 is freshman goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti, who leads the conference with 6.65 saves per game and 113 overall saves. Santa Barbara plans on creating havoc in the box for Giannetti after scoring four goals against Fullerton and outshooting Riverside 13-5 in last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to look up some game film and we’re going to come up with a system and style that is best going to suit us to have more of the ball,” Stumpf said. “Because of that, [hopefully we will] get some momentum and get more looks at the goal and hopefully stick them away.”</p>\n<p>Containing the Cal Poly offense will be a difficult task for Santa Barbara as the Mustangs enter with the No. 1 ranked offense in the league, scoring a conference-high 1.88 goals per game and 19 goals in total. Stopping freshman forward Elise Krieghoff will be top priority for the Gaucho’s backline. Krieghoff has top rank in the Big West in goals scored with 10 on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite having to settle for a record under .500, the Gauchos are still proud of what they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that our entire season we played really well; our record doesn’t show how hard we worked,” Mead said. “I’m really proud of the whole effort everyone has put in and just coming together as a team. It has been a very awesome year even though the record doesn’t show it.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s Blue-Green rivalry match is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/","id":1629,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1628,1627,1626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Rival Cal Poly in Overtime","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The game seemed locked up.

In fact, 36 shots were taken, with 21 put on frame, proving why the Blue-Green rivalry is one of best matchups in college soccer. UCSB dominated the shot count, doubling up on Cal Poly 24-12 while taking five more shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the 75th minute, the Gauchos found the back of the net. Ryan put UCSB on the board on a diving header crossed into the left side of the box by freshman midfielder Ema Boateng. The goal was Ryan’s eighth of the season.</p>\n<p>“After he scored, I personally thought that was it,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “I thought the game was done. He got an amazing ball from Ema and it was an amazing run by Nic … it was perfect. It was an incredible goal.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB thought it had the victory, the Mustangs had a different idea. With time winding down, sophomore goalkeeper Austin Mansker came out to block the shot of junior forward Mackenzie Pridham. In an already physical game, Pridham and Mansker collided and the ball fell right into the feet of junior midfielder George Malki, who scored on an open goal with 1:06 remaining and leveled the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>“I don’t quite understand why we’re hanging out in [Cal Poly’s] 18-yard box when there’s one minute left,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “All we had to do was stay behind the ball.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs went into overtime with momentum. They took the only two shots of the period, connecting on the second approximately six minutes into overtime.</p>\n<p>Against a tired Gaucho squad, Pridham and senior midfielder Chris Gaschen played a two-man game in the box. Pridham fired a shot from the six-yard box into the opposite corner of the goal, stunning the 13,467-member audience (the fourth-largest attendance at Harder Stadium).</p>\n<p>“Our guys were dead,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re just not deep enough to go into overtime and of course, emotionally they were spent because [they] think the game’s won.”</p>\n<p>Pridham proved why he is one of the best forwards in the league, tallying a goal and an assist on the night. He recorded five shots, all on goal, en route to scoring his ninth goal of the year and his fifth game-winner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we didn’t clear any of those balls,” Vom Steeg said. “We just left the ball there for him to do something with.”</p>\n<p>While the game was exciting offensively, some incredible goalkeeping was also on display. While Mansker tallied a season-high six saves, Cal Poly’s keeper, freshman Wade Hamilton, saved 12 shots, a career high.</p>\n<p>Having lost three of its last four games, Santa Barbara will look to rebound next weekend when the team hosts Stanford and UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48322\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48322\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/","id":1592,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1591,1590,1589],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Erupt to Beat CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Coming off its first conference win of the season last weekend, the UCSB women’s soccer team went on the road still in contention for qualifying for the Big West Tournament.

UCR took an early lead, scoring in the third minute on junior midfielder Andrea Morales’ shot from a set piece.</p>\n<p>The goal seemed to settle down the Gauchos, who then took control of the game for the entire duration of the match, even forcing a penalty kick, which was blocked by the Highlander goalkeeper. Despite outplaying UCR in every aspect, the Gauchos could not finish their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“We took more shots, we took more corner kicks, we even earned ourselves a penalty kick, but we just did not finish our chances,” Stumpf said. “I think the girls are a little disappointed in themselves because I think we let one slip away.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game, the Gauchos faced a Fullerton team that had only allowed four total goals in conference entering the match. However, UCSB capitalized on its only three shots in the first half, scoring the trio of goals in a 15 minute span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder/forward Indiana Mead opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the 15th minute, followed by freshman midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez’s third goal of the season a minute later. After the Titans cut the lead in half, senior midfielder Erin Ortega scored to send the Gauchos into halftime with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton came out of halftime pressuring the UCSB backline, outshooting the Gauchos 12-6 in the second half, but junior goalkeeper Makenna Henry was the defensive stopper of the game, coming up big with nine saves on the night. Freshman forward/midfielder Mayra Almazan sealed UCSB’s first road conference win of the season with her first collegiate goal in the 70th minute.</p>\n<p>“The shooting Friday night was significantly better and interestingly enough we played a better team on Friday and we snuck four [goals] in,” Stumpf said. “Friday night was a great performance for our team. Once again they played hard; the possession was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s four goals were the most allowed this season by the Titans, who came in as one of the top-ranked defenses in the Big West. These four goals were also the most scored this season by the Gauchos, who came in struggling and won only their second game in the last nine matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now prepare itself for the Blue-Green rivalry game against Cal Poly this Sunday at San Luis Obispo in its final match of the season.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/","id":1641,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1640,1639,1638],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rivalry Renewed: UCSB and Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/01-10-19-12-NEWS-11111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/01-10-19-12-NEWS-11111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"In tonight’s blue-green rivalry game against Cal Poly, pride won’t be the only thing on the line.

Cal Poly posts an equivalent 3-2-1 conference record and is 8-5-1 overall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’ve said to ourselves [that] we can’t lose anymore and that every game is important,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.“We need to find the back of the net and get a shutout. That’s the mentality we have right now.”</p>\n<p>Both teams came up with big wins Tuesday to keep the league standings close. The Mustangs defeated UC Davis, while Santa Barbara handed Big West leader Sacramento State its first conference loss. In UCSB’s 2-0 victory, the Gauchos finally found their offensive rhythm, scoring two goals in the first 10 minutes of play and breaking a two-game scoring drought.</p>\n<p>“I think our outside guys, like Ema, were busy early,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We got them the ball early and we got good service. We were lucky to get on the end of a couple and get ahead early, which we haven’t done in a while.” With a lack of scoring in the past, UCSB has switched formations, moving into a 4-2-3-1, which gives the outside backs freedom to push forward and get into the attack. That allows Santa Barbara to use one of its big offensive weapons in freshman defender Ema Boateng, who ranks third on the team in scoring with four goals.</p>\n<p>“A couple ways of scoring when you face nine to 10 guys (playing defense), [which] is what we see in every game, is to pass really well and get around the corners,” Vom Steeg said. “So, we made an effort to get Ema the ball and we’ll stay after that.”</p>\n<p>Allowing the Gauchos to switch into the more offensively minded line-up has been the return of senior midfielder Machael David. In David’s first game back from injury Tuesday, David assisted the first goal. Combined with Baiden, the two create a strong holding midfield, allowing more players to push up. “[David] provides a lot of the energy and he’s an emotional leader,” Vom Steeg said. “He does a lot of the running, which allows us to win the midfield and move forward. He’s a key piece to our ability to win games and move forward.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB ranks second in league in shots and goals, averaging 16.71 and 1.93 per game, respectively, this game may come down to defense and who scores first. The Gauchos concede just .79 goals per game, second in the Big West, while the Mustangs are right behind, allowing one goal per game.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’ll be a high scoring game, so I think that the team that scores first [will win],” Vom Steeg said. “For us, the key is to get a goal in that first half, even if [that means going] in 1-1 at halftime. We feel if we get two balls in every game, with the way we defend, we will win every game.”</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos all season has been Ryan, who ranks third in the league in points with seven goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>“I think Nic Ryan is stepping up like Luis Silva did for us last year,” Baiden said. “He’s a very creative player and very intelligent. We have to make sure he’s up the field more and not coming back to play defense.”</p>\n<p>On the other side for Cal Poly is junior forward McKenzie Pridham, who ranks second in the Big West in points with eight goals and is second is goals per game with a .57 average.</p>\n<p>“[Pridham] plays a position that is a really good match-up for us,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s [their] point forward and we have two really good centerbacks and in Welsh and Brockway. We will have two strong, physical defenders on him.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against rival Cal Poly is set for 8 p.m. The game will also be broadcast live on Fox Soccer Channel.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48292\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48292\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/","id":1640,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1639,1638,1637],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":24,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
