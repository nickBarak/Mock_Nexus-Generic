Westmont finished 2013 with an impressive regular season record of 14-0-3 before going on to lose in the NAIA National Championship by a score of 1-0.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, eyes will be on senior forward/midfielder Indiana Mead as she was recently selected to the Preseason All-Big West Conference Team by the conference’s coaches. Mead was hampered by injuries and was forced to miss the last four games of the 2013 season, but with a total of seven goals and four assists throughout her UCSB tenure, expectations will be riding high.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are really hoping for a win,” Mead said. “We have been putting in a ton of work to play hard and I think we have more of a winning spirit this year.”</p>\n<p>Another pivotal element that returns to the Gauchos this season is junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter. Ritter played in 16 games during the 2013 season, allowing only 12 goals and saving an impressive 82.6 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We expect a solid defensive performance with a shutout this game,” Ritter said. “We are really excited to build upon what we did last year.”</p>\n<p>With such impressive goalkeeping, UCSB will look to their offense to play a huge factor in adding wins. Senior Madison Beckley will be a crucial offensive weapon as she tied for the team lead in goals last season with five. Junior Angelisa Cortez and sophomore Morgan Idso will also look to make a big impact as they recorded a combined 5 goals and two assists in 2013.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ offense will have to be ready to take full advantage as Westmont comes into this exhibition with a relatively inexperienced goalkeeper in junior Lauren Dorr. Dorr faced a total of only seven shots last year and has only started one game in her Westmont career.</p>\n<p>However, this match won’t be anything to take lightly as Westmont possesses a trio of returning strikers that combined for a total of 18 goals and seven assists last season. Junior forward Kelsey Steck led the team with eight goals and one assist in the 2013 season as Westmont managed to outscore their opponents by a tally of 51 to 13.</p>\n<p>Following the loss of three top defenders after the 2013 season, the Gauchos will look to their younger players to step up and stop this high-powered Westmont offense. Leading the defensive core will be senior center back Miranda Cornejo who started 13 games last season.</p>\n<p>“A big change this year is that we have a deep bench with the addition of 10 new freshman,” Ritter said. “This will be key to winning more games because if somebody gets hurt then our bench will be able to step up.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition is set to kick off tomorrow at Harder Stadium at 7 P.M.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/","id":1574,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1573,1572,1571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Staying Atop the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Hopes to Win Conference For Second Straight Year by Bringing in a Crop of New Freshmen.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s soccer team finished this season with a loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament after capturing the regular season Big West Conference title.

I believe this is the first year where we have a recruiting class that does not have a transfer on it.”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB adds three forwards, four midfielders, three defenders and a goalkeeper for a recruiting class that is ranked No. 8 in the nation by Top Drawer Soccer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’d be excited as a fan of Gaucho soccer. Come see the MLS players today before they show up tomorrow, and you’re going to see a lot of that over the next couple of years,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year’s conference freshman of the year will come from this recruiting class.”</p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>Highlighting the forward class is Sacramento native Dalton Pando, who played club ball with the San Jose Earthquake Academy of the USSF. Pando was ranked No. 50 in Top Drawer Soccer’s top 150 academy players while also receiving the rank of No. 19 forward in the nation and No. 4 player from Northern California Region.</p>\n<p>Also coming from the San Jose Earthquake Academy is forward Alex Liua. The Los Altos native paired with Pando to form a dangerous attack for the Earthquake and will look to continue that next season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the forwards is Denis Kalamar of Seattle. Kalamar played for the Seattle Sounders Academy for three years and received a Top Drawer Soccer No. 10 ranking in the Pacific Northwest Region for his play.</p>\n<p>“I think a player like Adonis, like Kalamar, Pando, those are attacking players that can go onto a field and change it,” Vom Steeg said. “Alex is another player who attacks. Any of the guys who attack will have an opportunity to play for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Midfielders</strong></p>\n<p>Three players from the L.A. Galaxy Academy headline the midfield group of the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Adonis Amaya is the highest rated prospect coming in for the Gauchos as he received a No. 15 academy rating, No. 5 midfielder rating and a No. 4 rating in the Southern California Region. Amaya played defender for the U-17 U.S. National team and forward for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Fellow Galaxy Academy player Axel Mendez joins the Gauchos as the No. 32 ranked prospect out of the Southern California Region, according to Top Drawer Soccer. Mendez brings an attacking style of play to the midfield position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first player that we got to commit from this whole group was actually Axel Mendez,” Vom Steeg said. “Axel is unique to us because we haven’t really had a playmaker out of midfield. He has a real opportunity to contribute right away because of the position he plays.”</p>\n<p>Ryo Fujii also comes from the Galaxy Academy ranking No. 147 in the nation from the USSF Academy system. Fujii, a native of Torrance also ranks No. 21 in Southern California and is the No. 51 midfielder in the nation.</p>\n<p>Ludwig Ahl is one of two international prospects in this season’s recruiting class hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. Ahl played for AIK Stockholm in Sweden’s top amateur league and was considered for the Swedish National Team.</p>\n<p>“In the past, you’d be lucky to find one freshman starting at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year, there’s a chance that we can have eight or nine freshman or sophomores starting on the field. I would be really surprised if at least three freshman didn’t start for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Defenders</strong></p>\n<p>The other international player is Julian Busch from Eichenau, Germany where he played for 1860 Munich. Busch played in the U-17 Bundesliga, the top amateur league in Germany against formidable competition from all over Europe.</p>\n<p>“We feel like the international players are a little more mature,” Vom Steeg said. “Those are players that you think can contribute right away because they’re 20 (years old) and once again they have played at a high level.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will add a bit of east coast flair in Dugan Zier of New York. Zier played for the New York Red Bulls Academy and is one of eight USSF Academy players in the Gauchos recruiting class.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final player hailing from the Galaxy Academy is Jeff Quezada. Quezada was team captain for the Galaxy Academy during his time there and played alongside the trio of midfielders in addition to current UCSB players Josh McNeely and Drew Murphy. All six players won a USSF National Title with the Galaxy Academy in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We’re really high on Jeff Quezada. He’s got the respect of his team, he’s the captain of one of the top teams in the country, but again, he plays a really difficult position,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to have a great career here at UCSB, but because of the position he plays, there’s a big, huge learning curve there.”</p>\n<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>\n<p>Brandon Berke of De Anza Force SC rounds out the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Berke will most likely play backup to McNeely this season but provides the Gauchos with solid depth at the goalkeeper position.</p>\n<p>With 11 new players joining an already talented and young squad, the Gauchos look to have a bright future atop the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve really recruited the right type of kids with the right attitudes. I can’t say enough about these players that had the opportunity to go elsewhere; not only other colleges but obviously [they] do what they really want to do at some point, which is be a pro player, but instead they chose to play here at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “That is the attitude that will take us really far because I think players will be really committed to the team and committed to having a successful season.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/","id":1575,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1574,1573,1572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in 10 Talented Freshmen for Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos bring in young crop of forwards, defenders and goalkeepers for 2014 season.

Despite losing only five seniors from the roster to graduation, this recruiting class will try to fill the holes left in the forward and backline positions.</p>\n<p>Attempting to step up in the forward position will be Amanda Ball from Chino Hills High School, who headlines the class. Ball will have an opportunity to start right away and looks to fill the shoes of graduating senior forward Allie Ariniello, who tied for most goals on the team last year. Her athleticism and playmaking abilities up top make her a huge threat in the scoring department for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think we finally bring in — in Amanda Ball — something we have not had for a while,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “And that’s a very athletic, a very smart and a very technical soccer player, who is going to score a number of goals herself. But, she’s also going to attract so much attention, that I think she’s going to open up some space for some other people.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from Ball, the Gauchos turn to three more newcomers to add depth to the attacking positions. Brittney McKinney from Chaminade Prep in Woodland Hills, CA, is a player with a knack of putting the ball on frame and finished within the top 10 in her high school’s scoring list.</p>\n<p>Jordan Alves from Mary Star of the Sea High School can play in the forward and center midfielder position and can provide some versatility in the position. The San Pedro, CA native is in the discussion for possibly earning playing time in her first year. Recently committed Zoe Purcell from Torrey Pines High School, will add another option at the forward position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have not done a great job of scoring many goals the last couple of years,” Stumpf said. “We specifically went after some goal scorers that we thought were going to help us right away.”</p>\n<p>Defense, the strongest suit for UCSB last season, will lose three key leaders. The departure of Taylor Gehring and the Gankema twins, Paige and Lindsay, will most likely be filled by returning players, says Stumpf.</p>\n<p>However, Chace Schornstein from Redwood High School has potential to battle for a starting role, along with Kate Shoemaker from Poway High School in San Diego. The two use their size and physicality to keep the ball away from attackers.</p>\n<p>Despite a breakout season from junior Beth Ritter in between the goal posts last year, the Gauchos welcome three recruits in goalkeeping that can potentially threaten Ritter’s starting role. At 5’8”, Hannah Frogge from Bishop McGuinness High School in Oklahoma has the ideal frame for a goalkeeper and has athleticism to go with it. She had an impressive 90 percent save percentage her senior year.</p>\n<p>Remi White from Monte Vista High School and Brittney Rogers out of Murrieta Valley High School will also be in the goalkeeper rotation.</p>\n<p>“[Frogge is] going to come in and she’s going to challenge the two returning keepers pretty much right away in goal,” Stumpf said. “The other two goal keepers coming in — Remi White and Brittney Rogers — most likely, an educated guess will tell me they’re going to be backups at least their first years.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/","id":1572,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1571,1570,1569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two Gauchos Selected in MLS SuperDraft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fifi-Baiden_for-01.22_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fifi-Baiden_for-01.22_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Peter Schmetz and Fifi Baiden were selected in back-t0-back picks in the third round of the 2014 MLS SuperDraft on Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In case anyone does not already know, UCSB is a powerhouse when it comes to men’s collegiate soccer.

Both of these clubs are making an investment in these two players,” UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The goal is not to get drafted, but to make the team. It’s a good start for them but now they’ve got work to do to make the squad.”</p>\n<p>The duo joins a long list of Gauchos who have gone on to play professionally as 27 UCSB players were drafted by the MLS since 2004.</p>\n<p>“That’s why I went to UCSB from the beginning because it’s such a great soccer environment. We have such a great stadium, we have such a great community, we have so many fans at our games, it’s almost already like playing professionally,” Schmetz said. “It’s a great school as well, so it’s just the perfect fit.

Baiden leaves Thursday to Columbus to complete a physical before traveling with the team for preseason training in Florida on Saturday morning. Schmetz will arrive in Kansas City on Friday for a physical and depart with the team for Tucson, Arizona where preseason training will begin Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Both of them have been training on their own hoping to get this opportunity,” Vom Steeg said. “These are two players who have always worked hard during their time at UCSB, and hopefully things fall in place for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/","id":1571,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1570,1569,1568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to Penn State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=840%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Injuries and red cards plagued UCSB Sunday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a promising and historic year, the No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team’s season came to an end Sunday night in a 1-0 loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finishes the season with a final overall record of 12-6-3 after a historic undefeated 7-0-3 mark in the Big West.

A red card to senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden in the sixth minute of the game did not help the shorthanded Gauchos as UCSB was forced to play a man down for basically the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“Fifi was the only player on the field that has played in an NCAA playoff game,” Vom Steeg said. “Seven minutes in we went down to zero players that have played in a playoff game.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing a man down, UCSB controlled the ball for much of the first half and matched Penn State with three first half shots apiece. Both teams went into the half scoreless.</p>\n<p>The second half proved to be the difference for the Nittany Lions as freshman forward Connor Maloney gave Penn State a 1-0 lead with a strike from 18 yards out in the 78th minute. Penn State finished the night with 10 shots compared to just four for UCSB, including a four-to-one advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, [we’re] very disappointed to lose a goal. When we went down, it was just roll your sleeves up and fight and it’s what we’ve done all year,” senior defender Daniel Welsh said. “It’s a season to build on for next year for the guys who are coming back. I’m very happy the way it’s all ended in a way in a way, disappointed obviously at the same time.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion returned from injury to add an offensive weapon for the Gauchos. UCSB was still without three starters, however, as senior defender Peter Schmetz sat due to injury, and freshman midfielder Drew Murphy and junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez both missed Sunday’s game because of drawn red cards.</p>\n<p>Losing Baiden to a red card early in the match certainly dealt a big blow to an already depleted Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“Fifi, I thought, was going to have to be the most important player on the field for us to win tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “Obviously, that call dramatically changed [the game].”</p>\n<p>Penn State defeated St. Francis Brooklyn 1-0 on Thursday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament while the Gauchos received a first-round bye as one of the top-16 ranked teams.</p>\n<p>“We have enough on this field if our seniors show up to go win this game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “Our seniors did show up tonight, and they showed up in a big way, but we gave up the one shot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play in August 2014.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53254\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53254\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-penn-state/","id":1570,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1569,1568,1567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Quest for a National Title Starts at Harder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccer_CalPoly-DustinHarris-11092013-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccer_CalPoly-DustinHarris-11092013-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"The Tenth Seeded Gauchos Host the Second Round of the NCAA Playoffs Sunday ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Only 48 teams in the nation remain in the chase for the NCAA Championship, and by the time the UCSB men’s soccer team takes the field Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, that number will be down to 32.</p>\n<p>UCSB, which received the No. 10 seed in the tournament, will face the winner of Penn State and St. Francis Brooklyn, who square off today.

Santa Barbara secured a tournament seed despite falling in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament to Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited for the tournament,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “We’re fortunate enough to get a bye and a home game and we’re fired up to get a win off a tough loss.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will however play shorthanded on Sunday. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez and freshman midfielder Drew Murphy both received red cards during last week’s loss to Northridge and will be forced to sit out of Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Gauchos may be without a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and defender Peter Schmetz due to injury.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t really probably going to get an answer [on injuries] until closer to Saturday,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re pretty optimistic that Campion will be playing, at least try to play. Schmetz is probably a little bit of a longer shot. At the end of the day, it’ll be a game time decision really.”</p>\n<p>Penn State enters today’s contest as the host, finishing the regular season with an 11-5-2 overall and 5-1 mark in the Big Ten, good enough for a regular season conference title.</p>\n<p>“No matter who we play, it’s all going to come down to who has the energy and who’s ready to show up on Sunday,” Baiden said. “No matter who we play, we just need to make sure we come out with a ton of energy and make sure we get our goals to get the win.”</p>\n<p>St. Francis Brooklyn, meanwhile, finished the season 12-5-1 and 4-3 in conference, closing out the season with a three-game winning streak and a Northeast Conference Tournament title.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has really been on our own preparation. We do know a lot more about Penn State because they’re a little bit more out there, they’ve played some people we’re familiar with,” Vom Steeg said. “We literally know nothing about St. Francis. What we do know is someone is going to have to travel 3,000 miles to have to play us on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB in the NCAA Tournament from the Big West include No. 15 Northridge and No. 13 UC Irvine. This is the first time in conference history three teams have qualified for the tournament, and even more impressively, the first time three teams have received a top 16 ranking and a first round bye.</p>\n<p>“It is historical. To have the three teams out of the Big West seeded that’s really remarkable and speaks a lot about the quality of the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, think about how tough it was to go undefeated in conference play during a year when two other teams are seeded in the tournament.”</p>\n<p>This is the 11th time in the last 12 seasons the Gauchos have made a postseason appearance. UCSB is 11-1 all-time in NCAA Tournament matches played at home and can add to its already impressive postseason legacy on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to find a way to win on Sunday and if we can do that I think we have a good chance to win the next game,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s hard enough to miss two all-league performers but now you add two other starters and it’s going to make it real tough.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s NCAA Tournament second round match is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 21’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/","id":1568,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1567,1566,1565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Matadors in Big West Semifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finds out its fate Monday morning for the NCAA Tournament selection show.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is always disappointing when an undefeated streak comes to an end, but that was certainly the case Friday night when the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team fell to No. 22 Cal State Northridge 3-2 in a dramatic Big West Semifinals match.

The first half of the match was scoreless, and quite the opposite of the firework filled second half.</p>\n<p>Northridge started the scoring spree when junior forward Sagi Lev-Ari sent a header into the back of the net in the 58th minute. For Lev-Ari, it was a career-night as he registered a hat trick, extending his season goal total to 16 on the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB quickly responded, however, as sophomore defender Marshall Cazares scored in the 64th minute off an assist from freshman forward Ismaila Jome. Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko then gave the Gauchos the advantage with a beautiful free kick from 20 yards out in the 72nd minute.</p>\n<p>“We battled back and I thought we did what we did all year, which is compete,” Vom Steeg said. “I think if we stay right with 11 players, we win the game.”</p>\n<p>A second yellow card to junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez on a handball left UCSB shorthanded in the 73rd minute, opening the door for Northridge.</p>\n<p>Lev-Ari responded with a penalty kick goal in the 78th minute and another header in the 83rd to give the Matadors the victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will be without Garcia-Lopez as well as freshman midfielder Drew Murphy in its next match. Both players must sit out for receiving red cards during Friday night’s contest. Cazares was also injured during the game but is expected to return in time for the Gauchos’ first NCAA Tournament match.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating. It’s like watching a train wreck and you can’t stop it,” Vom Steeg said of the red cards and Northridge’s comeback.</p>\n<p>The top 16 teams in the tournament are given a first-round bye and host a second round match, meaning UCSB would receive more time off in an effort to rest injured players including senior forward Achille Campion and senior defender Peter Schmetz, both All Conference First Team Selections.</p>\n<p>“What’s critical is to not have to play on Thursday,” Vom Steeg said. “And that gives us until next Sunday to see about Campion and to see about Schmetz.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finds out its destiny Monday and is expected to play either Thursday or Sunday in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53069\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53069\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/","id":1569,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1568,1567,1566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It All Comes Down to This: Playoff Time","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.9.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-Cal-Poly-39.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.9.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-Cal-Poly-39.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Northridge in the semifinals of the Big West Playoffs","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A Big West Tournament Championship was one of the main goals for the UCSB men’s soccer team entering this season and that process begins tomorrow night when the No. 5 Gauchos host No. 22 Cal State Northridge in the Big West Semifinals.</p>\n<p>UCSB received a first round bye as Big West North Champs, finishing the regular season with a 12-4-3 overall record and 7-0-3 mark in conference play.

Santa Barbara trailed late in the game, but forced overtime with a late goal and later prevailed on a penalty kick in overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara last played Saturday in front of a record 12,805 fans in a thrilling 2-0 victory against rival Cal Poly. The victory extended the Gauchos’ undefeated streak to 11 matches, as they have not lost since late September.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident about Friday more because of how we played against Cal Poly than the fact that six weeks ago we beat Northridge,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re in a good position. I’m supremely confident we’re in the NCAA Tournament based on where things are right now. This is a great time to be playing and it’s a great time because you spend all year for the games like Friday night.”</p>\n<p>Intensity will certainly be ramped up Friday night as both teams are battling for a position in the NCAA Tournament. UCSB looks to have secured a berth in the tournament, but Northridge may still be on the bubble and a victory could go a long way towards a postseason appearance for the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Northridge possesses a potent offense, ranking second in the conference with 40 goals this season, compared to third ranked Santa Barbara, which finished the season with 29 goals.</p>\n<p>“They play more of a kind of simple way of soccer. They look to counterattack with their fast outside forwards who can handle the ball really well and I think that’s how they’ve scored a lot of their goals this season,” freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “We’re going to do our best to watch film and study how they play so we can be as best prepared for the offense as possible.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara possesses the top defense in the conference, allowing a mere 16 goals this season, meaning Friday’s matchup will pit a dangerous offense against a stingy defense.</p>\n<p>“We’re actually really excited because this is the second time playing them and the last time played them we won on a last-minute PK goal, so it’ll be interesting to play them again,” sophomore defender Marshall Cazares said. “They’re a good team, they’re probably the best team in the conference after us, so it should be a good game. We’re pumped.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has performed well this season and will make the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year, but is currently on the borderline of receiving a national seed ensuring a first round bye in the NCAA Tournament. A victory Friday or an outright Big West Tournament Title will strongly increase those odds.</p>\n<p>“Winning on Friday and getting into the Big West Tournament Finals would give us a for sure seed in the NCAA tournament, which is what we’ve based our season off of,” McNeely said. “That would be huge for us and a really big accomplishment so we’re looking forward to trying to get the win on Friday.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Friday night at Harder Stadium is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/","id":1567,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1566,1565,1564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fifi Baiden: Ghana Born, Gaucho Bred","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Fifi Baiden has excelled at UCSB on the field and in the classroom.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soccer for most is a hobby they pick up when young and drop by the time they hit high school.

Our parents wouldn’t be able to afford the education we needed,” Baiden said. “I got lucky to get selected to go to the academy at the age of 10. Right to Dream provided everything to help develop me as a player, and not just on the soccer field, but also a person through education.”</p>\n<p>After developing as a player and attending school, Baiden was presented with a remarkable chance to move to the United States through the academy.</p>\n<p>So, at the age of 15, Baiden left everything and everyone he knew and loved in Ghana for the opportunity to create a better life in America. The academy placed him at Dunn School, a private boarding school in Los Olivos, a mere 35 miles northwest of UCSB.</p>\n<p>During his time at Dunn, Baiden learned to value education and grew as a soccer player, earning team-MVP for three consecutive seasons while garnering interest from universities. Despite his immediate success, the transition from Ghana was not without its bumps.</p>\n<p>“When I got here it was hard for me to transition from Ghanaian culture to here. The accent was hard for me to adjust and my English wasn’t good,” Baiden said. “It was difficult but I had the support system around me when I got here to help me to learn and understand the culture.”</p>\n<p>In addition to playing for Dunn, Baiden also played for the Santa Barbara Soccer Club, leading to his discovery by UCSB.</p>\n<p>Once he stepped on campus at UCSB, Baiden immediately made his impact felt as a Gaucho, playing in 18 games as a true freshman and starting in seven. As a sophomore, Fifi increased his role even more, starting in all 23 games for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“He is responsible for directing our entire midfield, protecting our back four and at the same time linking up our midfield with the rest of our team,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “In my opinion, he plays the most important position on the field for us and does it at a very high level.”</p>\n<p>Baiden’s junior season really saw a takeoff in his game as he ended the season with All-Big West First Team honors along with a spot on the Big West Academic All-Conference Team. With a chance to go pro, Baiden decided to return to receive his degree and play his senior season, a campaign in which he was named All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>“In terms of a teammate, he’s kind of evolved. He was very quiet his freshman and sophomore year,” Vom Steeg said. “Last year, by necessity, he became more of a vocal player and this year he’s the first one in the locker room to urge the guys and encourage them and get after guys. Players listen to him because we know what he’s meant for the program and what he’s done for the team.”</p>\n<p>With the soccer season approaching its end, Fifi is prepared to shift his focus from college to the professional leagues. Baiden will receive his Bachelor’s degree in Sociology in less than four years and begin the process to be drafted in the MLS this season after UCSB concludes its season.</p>\n<p>“He’s a player that in my opinion has the tools needed to play at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to get an opportunity to at least be on an MLS roster with a chance to make that team. Hopefully that happens, and I think it will. We’re pretty optimistic that he’ll get that chance.”</p>\n<p>Now with his status as a budding professional player, Baiden has also shifted his focus to helping the people in his native country. This past summer, Baiden returned to Ghana and saw his family for the first time since he was 15.</p>\n<p>“It was a really fun experience for me to go back to see my family and also to work at this orphanage to teach the kids and help them to value education and also run some drills to help them improve their soccer skills,” Baiden said. “My long-term goal is to actually be a humanitarian and travel around the world, going to impoverished communities trying to help in any way possible I can.”</p>\n<p>Due to the absence of modern technology in Ghana, Baiden was unable to communicate with his family frequently until they were finally able to afford a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As UCSB challenges for the Big West title and an NCAA postseason appearance this season, no player has been as vital to the team’s success than Baiden.</p>\n<p>“You look at two or three things that had to go well for us to be successful and having a healthy Fifi play all season and become a leader on this team through his play is certainly one of the key, if not the most important components of our success,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>It is not every day an individual has the courage to move across the world alone at the age of 15, possess the work ethic and determination to succeed on the field and in the classroom, and possess the humbleness to continue working towards aiding his native people through humanitarian efforts.</p>\n<p>Baiden’s journey to the United States pales in remarkability to all he has managed to and will continue to accomplish. And to think it all started with the kick of a soccer ball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/","id":1566,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1565,1564,1563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Rival Cal Poly in TV Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccervsSLO_EricSwenson_11-2895818496-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccervsSLO_EricSwenson_11-2895818496-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Cal Poly 2-0 in the final regular season match of the year","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In front of the 12,805 fans in attendance and thousands more on television, the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team defeated rival Cal Poly 2-0 at Harder Stadium Saturday on Senior Night.</p>\n<p>With the victory, UCSB improved to 12-4-3 overall and 7-0-3 in conference play, becoming only the second team in history to finish the Big West season undefeated.

On top of it all, UCSB concluded a spectacular undefeated regular season, making this the game of the year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We made history, so we’re very happy about it,” senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko said. “We also knew our goal was to win conference, and we wanted to win it undefeated and we did. Now I hope we can go and, as a team, get our next goal and win the Big West tournament.”</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, the Gauchos came out firing in the second half and controlled much of the match. Boyoko gave the raucous crowd reason to celebrate in the 61st minute when he sent freshman midfielder Drew Murphy’s corner kick into the back of the net with a beautiful header in traffic to give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Boyoko was not done however, as he helped UCSB gain a 2-0 advantage in the 86th minute to ice the game. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez sent a through ball to Boyoko who then crossed it to Charlie Miller as the sophomore forward sent a shot past a diving Cal Poly goalkeeper to ensure UCSB would come away victorious on such a special night.</p>\n<p>“The fans did a great job coming out, and so we came prepared to make sure we got a win and to enjoy the moment,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “It’s not every time that you get that kind of atmosphere. We really appreciate the opportunity and we felt this was a moment we had to get the win to enjoy with our fans.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly lost its second consecutive match and finished in third place in the Big West North. The Mustangs will play at Cal State Northridge Tuesday in the Big West Conference Quarterfinals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara receives a first-round bye as North Division Champions and will host the winner of Cal Poly and Northridge on Friday in the Big West Semifinals.</p>\n<p>In what has already been an incredible and historic season for UCSB, the Gauchos have a chance to further assert their dominance in the conference in the tournament. Saturday night was a time of celebration for Santa Barbara, and now they must prepare to further extend its 11-game undefeated streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts a Big West semifinal match on Friday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52903\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52903\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/","id":1565,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1564,1563,1562],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry Part Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces rival Cal Poly in a televised match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em></em>Anytime UCSB and Cal Poly meet up on the pitch, excitement and madness are guaranteed to ensue.

With that many fans in attendance, Blue-Green rivalry games are always noted for the booming crowds and hectic cheers aimed at the rival team.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important [to win] because we know we are a better team than them and we have to show that on Saturday,” Jome said. “A win against them, in hopefully a packed Harder Stadium, is the perfect way to end our regular season heading into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also has an opportunity to become the second team in history to finish a Big West season undefeated in conference play if they can win or tie against Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re obviously undefeated so we want to go into that game and make sure we take care of business, get the three points and then we’ll move on from there,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “So far it’s good, we’re still undefeated nine games in now.”</p>\n<p>With a victory or tie on Saturday, UCSB would also have home field advantage throughout the Big West Conference Tournament, clinching the top record in the entire conference.</p>\n<p>By clinching the Big West North, Santa Barbara has already secured a first round bye in the Big West tournament as well as home field advantage through the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Despite a scoreless draw against Sacramento State on Wednesday, the third-straight tie for UCSB, the Gauchos are primed to enter the NCAA postseason once again this year, regardless of the results of the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“It was tough. We wanted to go out there and beat Sac State to get our RPI high and everything,” Baiden said. “We didn’t lose but at the same time we wanted a win against Sac State.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match features some high scoring offenses as Cal Poly leads the entire nation in goals scored and features a deadly weapon in senior forward Mackenzie Pridham who ranks second in the nation with 14 goals this season.</p>\n<p>When UCSB faced Cal Poly earlier this season, the Gauchos’ defense held Pridham scoreless in an impressive defensive effort by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ball, UCSB ranks third in the Big West in goals scored, but is well suited to slow down Cal Poly as the top ranked defense in the league, allowing only 16 goals this season. The Mustangs, however, rank last in the conference with 28 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an important game for both teams,” Baiden said. “We lost against them last year so we’re going to make sure we don’t repeat that. We’re going for the win and trying to finish the season strong, going undefeated and winning against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry at Harder Stadium is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports West.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/","id":1594,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1593,1592,1591],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Eighth Straight vs. Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-31.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-31.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels North to take on Sac State","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s soccer team travels to face Sacramento State today with a chance to clinch the Big West outright with a victory.

We also know that it’s a team that defensively does give up goals.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Back in October when these two teams met at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos used a strong offensive performance from freshman forward Ismaila Jome to down the Hornets 2-1. The Hornets have given up the most goals in the conference with 27 allowed this season; a recipe for disaster when considering UCSB ranks third in the Big West with 27 goals scored this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a 1-1 draw against UC Davis, a result that extended the Gauchos unbeaten streak to nine games and kept their conference recorded undefeated.</p>\n<p>Sac State has dropped seven of its last eight matches, accumulating only one victory in conference play. Last time out, Sac State was trounced 4-2 by Cal Poly, and although the Hornets lost, it was the first time all season they scored more than one goal in a match. The Hornets rank last in the Big West with 11 goals scored in 16 games this season.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can get on top of them early and stay on top of them,” Vom Steeg said. “What we’re looking for is a really solid game on Wednesday where we put our defense and offense together, play a complete game and come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>With one of the highest RPI rankings in the country, the Gauchos case for postseason play beyond the conference tournament looks strong. Another victory Wednesday will only solidify UCSB’s place in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB will however enter the game shorthanded. Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann must sit out the contest due to accumulating five yellow cards this season. Injuries have also taken a toll on the Gauchos as senior defender Peter Schmetz is out for the near future and senior forward and leading goal scorer Achille Campion is questionable for the game.</p>\n<p>“I think every Big West game is a challenge. Out of the eight Big West games that we’ve played, I think we’ve been behind in six of them,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s not what we want to do, but we are just having to battle our way all the way until the end of the season. I just wouldn’t be surprised if Wednesday isn’t any different; we’re going to have to battle our way through Wednesday’s game, and once again, like we’ve been doing, find a way to win.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Wednesday is scheduled for 2 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/","id":1590,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1589,1588,1587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Powerful Bond Between Teammates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10.4.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-33.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10.4.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-33.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"During a Breakout Season, Beth Ritter Used Injured Teammate Makenna Henry as Inspiration","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not many people saw the UCSB women’s soccer team’s season going the way it did this year — not just because of the significant improvement by the team as a whole, getting its most wins in a season since 2009 — but also because of the big shoes filled by the smallest player on the field.</p>\n<p>Listed at 5’4’’, sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter does not possess the height typical of a goalkeeper. Yet, she established herself this year as an elite player in the Big West, leading the league in shutouts and becoming the centerpiece of the Gaucho defense. What seems more improbable is that none of it should have happened.</p>\n<p>A career-ending injury to starting senior goalkeeper Makenna Henry in the beginning of the season gave way to Ritter emerging as UCSB’s goalkeeper of the future. With one collegiate career beginning and the other coming to an end, something special between Ritter and Henry developed through the course of the season: a relationship strengthened by adversity and friendship.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Mak is my number one role model on this team,” Ritter said. “I learned so much from her work ethic and her desire to play well and get better every single day … she’s the captain of our team, so she leads like no other and I just try to be like her as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Although they are two years apart in age, the two have a lot more in common other than just being goalkeepers for the Gauchos. In fact, going back to last season, the two have shared a common bond with one another.</p>\n<p>In Ritter’s first year, she sat out the entire year as a redshirt freshman recovering from knee surgery. Before that, Ritter did not play in her final two years in high school because of knee injuries suffered before. With five knee surgeries in total, Ritter did not know if she would ever step onto the field again.</p>\n<p>“It was hard in college to watch my team play and not really be a part of it other than just a cheerleading aspect,” Ritter said.</p>\n<p>While Ritter was recovering during her first year, Henry suffered a right knee injury during a pre-conference game that severely limited her abilities. Henry toughened out the injury for the entire season even though she was forced to play with a knee brace.</p>\n<p>That knee brace brought with it its challenges: a reduction in her mobility, agility and even how she kicked the ball. Yet, one player was always there for Henry the entire season despite all the hard times.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling to get through season, [but Beth] was helping me all the way through, giving me little pick-me-ups here and there,” Henry said. “It was nice getting through a training session with someone who knew exactly what the struggles were.”</p>\n<p>Ritter knew exactly what those struggles were considering she had been dealing with knee injuries since high school and still at UCSB. For Ritter, her first year playing with Makenna was more than just learning and getting healthy; it was the start of her becoming a soccer player again.</p>\n<p>“[Makenna] used to bring me out when I was injured and work with me even if I couldn’t run, if I couldn’t dive,” Ritter said. “She would kick balls to my hand when no one else even acknowledged that I was on the team. She really set me up for the opportunity to start playing.”</p>\n<p>Flash-forward to this year and a fully healthy Ritter is able to finally play soccer for the first time in years, making her UCSB debut in the second game of the season against Weber State in a 1-1 draw.</p>\n<p>What she originally thought was going to be a year of cheerleading on the bench suddenly became a lot more when Henry could no longer go on playing injured.</p>\n<p>In her first game taking over for Henry versus Pacific University, Ritter had to deal with the usual nervousness, but instead of concentrating on herself, Ritter kept one person in mind the entire time.</p>\n<p>“What was really going through my mind was don’t let [Makenna] down. You’re playing for her right now,” Ritter said. “That’s all I needed to tell myself, play for Makenna, because as long as you focus on that, you’re not going to worry about yourself and worry about your decisions. I knew she would be proud of me if I played well.”</p>\n<p>Not only did UCSB win that game in overtime 1-0, Ritter was correct in making Henry proud of her when she revealed what she was thinking about during the game to Henry.</p>\n<p>“She actually did reveal that to me in one of our talks that we always have after our practices,” Henry said. “It’s a really huge honor to hear that from someone you respect as a person and as a goalkeeper. When she told me that, I was at a loss for words.”</p>\n<p>From that game on, Ritter showed what she was capable of accomplishing when fully healthy. Stepping in for Henry, Ritter had one of the best seasons by a UCSB goalkeeper ever recorded. At one point in the season Ritter had five straight shutouts, ending the season with the most in the Big West with eight and coming in second in save percentage at .826.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Ritter is quick to point out that it would not have been possible without her defenders and what she learned from Henry.</p>\n<p>“She took the time after practice to tell me how she always carries me with her out in the field,” Henry said. “Whatever influence I’ve had on her, either leading by example on and off the field, it was really cool to see her succeed like that and to know I had some positive effect on her success.”</p>\n<p>With Ritter now taking over the reins for UCSB, she remains as motivated as ever and does not take for granted any moment she is on the field, considering the years she spent off it.</p>\n<p>“In this weird way our injuries kept us closer together because we understood the challenges that came with being injured,” Henry said. “We were able to be each other’s support system and each other’s confidants.”</p>\n<p>If there ever was a case of injuries bringing a stroke of serendipity with it, look no further than Makenna Henry and Beth Ritter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/","id":1589,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1588,1587,1586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fight to Draw Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB extended its unbeaten streak to nine games with the draw.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After not registering a draw in its first 15 matches of the season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s soccer team concluded Saturday night’s game at Harder Stadium with its second consecutive draw in a 1-1 decision against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s draw brings Santa Barbara’s record to 11-4-2 on the season with an undefeated 6-0-2 conference mark.

However, UCSB has a lot to look forward to going into next year; the team returns junior midfielder Madison Beckley who also led the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos will return experienced underclassmen as well as sophomore goalkeeper Ritter who had the most shutouts in the Big West (8) and finished second in save percentage (.826).</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament begins later this week with Cal Poly, UC Irvine, UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton qualifying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 4, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-drop-match-miss-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-drop-match-miss-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-drop-match-miss-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-drop-match-miss-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-drop-match-miss-postseason/","id":1596,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1595,1594,1593],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":21,"route":"/categories/sports/soccer","highestPage":33}},"__N_SSG":true}
