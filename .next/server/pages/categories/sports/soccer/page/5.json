The Gauchos’ offense relentlessly attacked the opposition and their defense limited the Warriors’ goal-scoring attempts in a great all-around effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB got out and attacked early, as they put seven shots on goal in the first 22 minutes of action before senior Shaelan Murison got behind the keeper and scored to put the Gauchos on the board first in the 26th minute. Santa Barbara did not have to wait long to get some more offensive production as they extended their lead thanks to junior Angelica Ortega’s goal at the 40-minute mark, assisted by sophomore forward Jessica Wright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos coasted into halftime with a comfortable lead and a dominant half of soccer under their belt. UCSB’s ten shots compared to only one for Westmont showed the clear advantage that the Gauchos held on both sides of the ball and it was a trend that continued for the rest of the game as Westmont only managed one shot on goal for the entire match.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head Coach Paul Stumpf used this exhibition as an opportunity to spread around the playing time amongst players, and with a comfortable 2-0 lead, it proved to be the perfect time to get some of the reserves and younger players into the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first major substitution made came right after the half, as sophomore Natalie Hill relieved the starting goalkeeper, senior Hanna DeWeese. Hill remained in goal for about 23 minutes before freshman keeper Evann Smith relieved her and played out the final 22 minutes, where she recorded the team’s only save of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the starters remained in the game until the 54th minute, when Stumpf pulled them all to get other players some minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont was able to keep the game somewhat interesting as they outshot the UCSB reserves 4-1 in the final 36 minutes of action, but they could not turn any of those opportunities into goals and time expired to give the Gauchos the 2-0 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison lead the way for the Gauchos with a game-high eight shots, six shots on goal, and one goal that gave Santa Barbara an early lead. Wright finished second on the team with four shots, two on goal, and she assisted on the Gauchos second and final goal of the game. Ortega scored the second goal of the game in the 40th minute, and it was one of her two shots on the day, with both of them being on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Westmont, there were not many shots to be had on offense, as the Gaucho defense gave them trouble all game, and senior Maddi Berthoud was the only Westmont player to have more than one shot attempt, with two. Midfielder Brooke Porter was the only Warrior to take a shot on goal, and her attempt in the 85th minute was blocked by Smith of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont’s junior goalie Gabi Haw probably had the busiest day out of any player who took the field, as she had to defend the 16 Gaucho shots and 11 shots on goal. She played the full 90 minutes and finished with nine saves and two goals given up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This match served as a productive final tune-up before the regular season begins and the Gauchos embark on a very tough non-conference schedule. UCSB will play their next game back at Harder Stadium against the Minnesota Golden Gophers on Thursday, August 22, at 7:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The two teams combined for 28 fouls, 10 yellow cards, and one red card in what turned out to be an extremely chippy “friendly” match. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match started out rocky, but not due to any bad blood between the two squads.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of NCAA guidelines, both teams only had around three practices with their full coaching staff prior to the game, which meant that the chemistry and crispness that comes along as the season progresses really wasn’t there for either side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB opened up the match by sending a few long-balls over the top to star forward Rodney Michaels, compensating for their lack of technical sharpness by attempting to take advantage of their speed at the forward position. Westmont held strong however, and came out of the gates playing an extremely physical style of defense that actually managed to stifle the Gauchos for most of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This aggressiveness came back to bite them pretty quickly however, as in the 9th minute of the game a questionable foul call on the Warriors gave the Gauchos a free kick about 22 yards out from goal. Senior midfielder Thibault Candia stepped up and sent a perfectly curled ball to the back post which senior defender Faouzi Taieb headed home after leaping over the Westmont defense, giving UCSB and Taieb their first goal of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the first half wore on, a couple of patterns began to emerge that would continue to play out until the final whistle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos would typically maintain possession on their side of the pitch, but just couldn’t complete the final pass once they got into the attacking third. Westmont was more than happy to stay back and aggressively cut off passing lanes hoping to create some fast-break opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One such opportunity arose in the 20th minute when Warriors’ midfielder Jose Vargas intercepted a sloppy clearance by senior Kaya Fabretti on the Gauchos’ side of the pitch. Vargas seemed to have a clear path to goal but Fabretti raced back to make a tackle and eventually push the ball up-field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB just seemed to be a step too slow throughout the whole game, although how much of it was rust and how much was simply underestimating their NAIA opponent can’t really be calculated, and the Westmont D led by the stone wall that is senior defender Tim Heiduk made sure that openings were few and far between in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out of the locker room in the second half with a revamped intensity, partially sparked by the play of freshman Lucas Gonzalez. The LA Galaxy Academy product was all over the pitch in his first official game for UCSB, playing with not just energy but also a surprising composure that will potentially earn him more minutes as the season wears on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez set up Candia with a beautiful pass in the 48th minute that led to a cross into the middle that was easily cleared by a Warrior defender. This clearance would prove to be significant however, as it went out to Westmont’s Justin Nakaoka who was then fouled and shoved by Kaya Fabretti. A small scuffle ensued when Jose Vargas came running and shoved senior forward Ignacio Tellechea to the ground, and eventually Fabretti, Vargas and Tellechea all received yellow cards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scuffle seemed to serve as a spark plug for both teams, as the intensity of the match drastically increased right after. This culminated into one of the more exciting sequences in the game in the 70th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont midfielder Samuel Toscano intercepted a bad pass in the back-half and streaked across to the right side of the box leaving nobody between him and UCSB goalie Alan Carrillo. He then sent a wild cross in that somehow ended up at the feet of Rodney Michaels, who took the ball the entire length of the pitch the other way and sent a perfect pass to a wide-open forward Carter Clemmenson who banged the ball off the near post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the last twenty minutes did have a few close opportunities for both teams, the most interesting part might have been junior defender Omari Fontes’ five minutes of action. He entered in the 80th minute, received a questionable yellow card for a seemingly mundane tackle one minute later, then was ejected in the 85th minute after getting another yellow card for shoving a Westmont player in the back. The Gauchos were then forced to play out the rest of the game with ten men, but they eventually came out with the win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s tough to draw too many conclusions from an exhibition match but UCSB does need to be weary of a few things moving forward. Problems with creating goals and finishing offensive sequences in the final third have haunted this team since last season, and were a big reason that they couldn’t advance further in the Big West Tournament. While rust and a lack of chemistry definitely played a role in this last game, there will have to be a quick return to form for the Gauchos as they prepare for a tough upcoming slate of games including matchups against UNLV, CAL, Virginia Tech, and Gonzaga.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Santa Barbara is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looking to build off of their successful campaign last year as they finished the year with a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record of 13-7-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Westmont Warriors began their season this past Thursday when they fell to Southern Oregon by a score of 2-1. Despite a hot start with senior midfielder Brooke Porter scoring in the eighth minute of the contest, the Warriors gave up two second-half goals and were unable to get </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the equalizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Warriors are led by junior goalkeeper Gabi Haw, who is the reigning Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) Co-Player of the year. She finished with four saves against Southern Oregon. Senior forward Maddi Berthoud and sophomore midfielder Teagan Matye have led the offensive attack for Westmont and will look to make more of an impact this upcoming Saturday.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the result will not count toward the Gauchos’ overall record, it will be crucial </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for Santa Barbara to remain focused and play hard as they develop an identity for this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of hype around this Gauchos’ squad as they have been picked to finish second in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Big West Conference this upcoming season. Many attribute this to senior forward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shaelan Murison, who finished last year with ten goals. In order for the ‘Chos to have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">success this year, they will look to Murison to finish off scoring opportunities in addition to being a playmaker for her teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With seven starters returning for Santa Barbara, there is a sense that the team will be able </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to build on their chemistry from last season. One of the biggest returners is senior </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese is the anchor of the Gauchos’ defense and has proven </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be a force in front of the goal with her quick instincts and decisive decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the return of several starters, there are a couple of newcomers who will surely have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a role this upcoming season. Junior defender Emma Vanderhyden seems to be a popular </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">choice for being the player who could potentially have the biggest impact early on in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eastern Washington transfer has already played two years at the collegiate l</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evel, making it seem likely that she will be in the starting lineup. UCSB will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">look to Vanderhyden to stabilize the back end of the field and slow down the transition </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">counters by their opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to improve from last season, it will be key for them to continue to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow on the offensive end of the field. With Murison most likely to be doubled by the Warriors when she enters the box area, it will be crucial for other Gauchos to step up and find the back of the net. This will not only take pressure off of Murison but also give the other Gauchos the confidence to know that they are  just as capable to score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is able to play each game with consistent energy and attention to detail, they will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not only have a chance to win most of their games but potentially win the Big West as well. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the team is composed of both veterans and young talent, many believe this will be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the year the Gauchos win the conference title. Head coach Paul Stumpf will surely look to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his seniors to provide leadership for his younger players on the pitch as well, especially in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">times of adversity during a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all starts this Saturday when the UCSB women’s soccer team faces Westmont in an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exhibition match at 5:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Their last meeting went heavily in favor of the home side as the Gauchos routed the Warriors by a score of 7-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB does have the historical advantage when it comes to this matchup however. As of their last meet, the Gauchos now lead the Warriors by a record of 28-24-4.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Rodney Michael will definitely be a player to keep your eye on for the Gauchos. In the 18 games he played last season, Michael contributed a team-leading total of seven goals and also threw in three assists, earning himself a spot on the 2018 All-Big West First Team and 2018 All-Far West Region First Team. Michael is primed to fill up the scoresheets once more this season as the former 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year looks to play a vital first-team role for Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the pitch, senior midfielder Thibault Candia seems to be the man pulling all the strings. The French playmaker tallied a team-leading seven assists last year, along with a goal, in the 18 games he featured in.</p>\n<p>At the backline is senior center back Faouzi Taieb, who made his presence known at both ends of the field considering he finished last season as the team’s second-highest goalscorer from a defensive position. He was also one of only three players who started all 18 games consecutively.</p>\n<p>Taieb’s potential impact for the Gauchos this season is just another exciting storyline we’ll have to wait to see unfold as the new season progresses.</p>\n<p>The kick off time is slated for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday Aug. 17, with the preseason promo including schedule posters and post-game autographs for fans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/","id":1337,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1336,1335,1334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Kick Off Season With Exhibition Match in LA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2019-08-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team is set to start off their 2019 campaign with an exhibition match against Cal State Los Angeles this Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79385\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1074029026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89546\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79385\" data-attachment-id=\"79385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-soccer-ends-season-with-1-1-tie-versus-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/christine-maurer-fights-for-the-ball-hallie-browndaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christine Maurer fights for the ball.

That loss solidified their season record at a respectable 13-7-1 overall and 5-2-1 in Big West play. The Gauchos graduated 13 seniors from last year including three All-Conference contributors whose roles still need to be filled. But even with the departure of several key contributors, the Gauchos were still picked to finish second in the conference according to the Big West coaches poll that was released earlier this week. This exhibition provides a perfect opportunity to see how the players are fitting into their new roles and what the current rotations look like as we move closer to the start of the regular season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the biggest storyline to keep an eye on as we head into another year of Gaucho soccer is the return of Shaelan Murison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior forward is coming off of a First Team All-Conference selection last season, as well as a preseason All-Conference selection heading into this year. Murison started all 21 games for the Blue and Gold a season ago, leading the team in goals with 10, points with 24, as well as game-winning goals, of which she had five. As the best returning player on a talented team, Murison will be responsible for a lot of the offensive production this year, but she will also have to take on a larger leadership role as one of the six seniors on this Gaucho squad. In this season-opener against Cal State LA, she will likely take her first steps toward getting used to her increased role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to look out for in this exhibition is senior midfielder Lynsee Voss, whose three goals a season ago puts her behind Murison for the second most goals scored among returning players. Voss appeared in 16 games and started in 14, and both of those numbers should increase this season along with her role within the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior midfielder Christine Maurer, who, despite only scoring two goals last season, finished second on the team in shots and shots on goal, with 41 and 19 respectively, could be another key cog for UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few adjustments and some off-season improvement we might see Maurer take a big leap this year in terms of offensive efficiency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will also get our first look at some of the 14 freshmen that will be donning the Gaucho uniform for the first time this Friday. The competition between newcomers for playing time is sure to be fierce and this match could be a determining factor in who wins a starting spot for Santa Barbara’s season opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this matchup might have no actual bearing on the upcoming season, there’s bound to be many interesting smaller takeaways as we get to see the team in action for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will take on Cal State LA at Jesse Owens Stadium on Friday at 6 p.m.. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89546\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89546\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/","id":1334,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1333,1332,1331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How the Terps Made it to the Final Four","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/RecapFront.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/RecapFront.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a five-year drought, the University of Maryland men’s soccer team has again arrived at the College Cup.

This year, the Terrapins have made easy work of their opponents through the NCAA Tournament thus far, achieving shutouts in all matches.</p>\n<p>Despite the story told by the numbers, No. 11 Maryland has knocked off nationally-ranked programs along the way. Most notably perhaps, is the Terps’ 1-0 victory over No. 3 Kentucky last Friday, Nov. 30. Not only shutting out the third-ranked team in the nation, but also doing so on the Wildcat’s home turf in Lexington demonstrates the momentum Maryland is riding heading into this year’s Final Four.</p>\n<p>Given Maryland’s success in the postseason this year, it may be assumed the team has been prospering since the season’s start in August. Contrarily, the Terps didn’t pick up their first win until they hosted West Virginia at home on Sep. 10, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Prior to its 1-0 shutout win over the Mountaineers, Maryland held a 0-2-2 record. Obviously an undesirable start for any team, the Terps still find themselves at the College Cup, thriving nonetheless.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the team’s shaky start, Maryland has managed to culminate an 11-6-4 overall record; however, the narrative of the Terps’ season encompasses an element of growth. An overtime loss at home to Big Ten foe Wisconsin in September found the Terps deflated, sitting sub-.500 once again.</p>\n<p>The loss came only a week after Maryland earned its second consecutive win of the year to get to .500. Whether or not the Terrapins knew in September that they’d return to racking up consecutive wins when it mattered or not, the team bounced back from the Wisconsin loss, going 9-3-2 to reach the biggest stage of college soccer.</p>\n<p>Through their rejuvenation following the loss to the Badgers, the Terrapins mustered a 4-4 record in the competitive Big Ten conference. At the top of the Big Ten, this season is Indiana, boasting a perfect 8-0-0 conference record as part of its 20-2-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Hoosiers are who stand in Maryland’s way now as the two conference opponents are set to face off for the third time this season. This time, though, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p>Back in October, Indiana defeated the Terps 2-1, but November saw Maryland settle for a 1-1 tie against the Hoosiers in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. It is since that 1-1 tie that the Terps have achieved three consecutive NCAA Tournament shutouts.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned victory over Kentucky stands as the most recent of upsets for Maryland, but a week prior to the taming of the Wildcats found the Terps defeating No. 10 Duke at home 2-0. The Blue Devils had no answer for Maryland, as they were met with the same fate that Kentucky arrived at a week later.</p>\n<p>The Terps may have an inclination to spoil opposing fans’ hopes on the road, but Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara will perhaps offer an even greater outcome to be coveted.</p>\n<p>Along with two winless games worth of potential revenge, the Terps have the opportunity to knock off the kingpin of the Big Ten and the second-ranked team in the country on Friday night. The Hoosiers will undoubtedly aim to prove why they’re deserving of their unblemished 8-0-0 conference record; however, Maryland is a different, more nuanced team heading into the match.</p>\n<p>Led primarily by senior midfielder Amar Sejdic, Maryland boasts a balanced attacking core featuring junior forward/midfielder Paul Bin alongside Sejdic. Sejdic in his senior year has started all 19 games for the Terps and leads the team with six goals off of 54 shots.</p>\n<p>Despite the hefty amount of misses implied in the midfielder’s shooting statistics, it’s clear Sejdic is comfortable taking the lead and will undoubtedly be looked for on the offensive side of things Friday night.</p>\n<p>While clearly a prominent part of Maryland’s offensive gameplan, Sejdic remains without a goal in this year’s two games against Indiana. Likely drawing ample and deserved attention from the Hoosiers on Friday, Sejdic will perhaps open up chances for teammates like Bin to exploit.</p>\n<p>In October’s loss to Indiana, Bin scored the lone goal for Maryland, so he will look to find the back of the net again. With four goals and two assists, Bin sits behind Sejdic in scoring but ranks second on the team in efficiency. In contrast to Sejdic’s 54 shots, Bin has tallied only 26.</p>\n<p>While Sejdic and Bin have been responsible for 12 of Maryland’s goals this season, the Terps’ roster holds three other players who have scored at least two goals on the year. This balanced scoring potential, as well as experience, might be expected at this stage of the postseason, but it provides Maryland the luxury to trust their offensive sets and find the net organically rather than play hero ball.</p>\n<p>Heading into Friday’s game against Indiana, Maryland has the opportunity to knock out a Hoosier team responsible for two winless matches, but the Terps are playing for much more than revenge. Despite the tantalizing element of revenge, Maryland looks for a more rewarding outcome of playing for the College Cup Championship.</p>\n<p>With revenge as well as championship aspirations on the line, the Terrapins will face Indiana at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

edition of the all-coveted College Cup Playoff.</p>\n<p>Following a 14-4-4 season that landed Michigan State in the third spot of the Big Ten, the Cinderella Spartans hope to continue their fairytale performance in the NCAA playoff with just two games separating them and the title of the top collegiate soccer program in the nation.</p>\n<p>Although Michigan State has been 8-3-3 back home in

Following a first-round win against the University of Chicago, Illinois with a 2-0 victory, Michigan State found itself matched up against No. 4 Louisville in the second round.</p>\n<p>The Spartans got out to an early lead in the 16th minute as freshman midfielder Jack Beck received a lead from senior forward Ryan Sierakowski on a breakaway hook to the bottom right-hand corner. Louisville was able to tie it up one goal apiece with a strike in the 77th minute that ultimately forced the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>Just two minutes into extra time, junior midfielder Giuseppe Barone sent a free kick from the left side into the six. Louisville bobbled a crucial clearance as senior defenseman John Freitag netted a walk-off finish that propelled Michigan State to its second Sweet 16 appearance in as many seasons.</p>\n<p>In game three of the playoffs, sophomore midfielder Michael Miller lasered a first-half strike from 35 yards out, which was all the Spartans needed to edge out the win against No. 13 Georgetown with a slim 1-0 shutout. Georgetown peppered off five shots in the final five-minute frame, but their comeback attack fell short as the Spartans advanced to their second consecutive Elite 8 appearance.</p>\n<p>James Madison University struck early in its Quarter-Finals matchup with Michigan State as Dukes’ junior defensive midfielder Niclas Mohr snuck a dribbler past senior keeper Jimmy Hague for one of only two goals that Hague has allowed during the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>As the Spartans’ season was dwindling at point-blank range, Sierakowski took matters into his own hands as he lifted the ball just over a diving Dukes keeper to tie the game up at 1-1 with less than 20 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Under 10 minutes later, Sierakowski was back for vengeance again as the Spartans made a game-winning drive down the pitch. Senior defender Connor Corrigan lofted a long, arcing pass up to redshirt sophomore defender Patrick Nielsen who corralled the feed and found Sierakowski in the box for a split-second look.</p>\n<p>Sierakowski made a snap decision as he read the keeper’s range from three yards out. With a hesitation move and a swift heel touch, the veteran striker finessed a curl around Dukes goalkeeper TJ Bush that capped off the 2-1 comeback and sent the Spartans to their first Final Four appearance in 50 years.</p>\n<p>In his senior year, Sierakowski has been premier on the attack for the Spartans as the McHenry, Illi. native has delivered eight goals and five assists in 22 games this season while leading the Spartans past a mighty Big Ten Conference that boasted four teams that were selected to participate in the 2018 NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The Big Ten commands the Final Four this season as Michigan State, University of Maryland and University of Indiana make up three of the remaining four teams still in the running to take home the College Cup.</p>\n<p>Ryan Sierakowski finished the season as the No. 4 goal scorer in the Big Ten Conference and in the No. 5 spot for overall points as well with a team-leading 21 points on the season. On top of that, his four game winners on the season were tied for second in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>The dangerous forward is complimented well by a playmaking Barone who ranks second in the conference in assists with 10 on the year. Barone is an elusive 5’9’’ attacking mid that powers the Spartan charge with 16 points tallied this year, which was good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>As if the Sierakowski-Barone one-two punch wasn’t enough, senior forward and Michigan native DeJuan Jones has posted five goals along with five assists in 2018 to round out a deadly triangle rotation for MSU.</p>\n<p>The trio of experience led Michigan State to the No. 2 in the Big Ten Conference in both total points with 112 and goals on the year with 35 goals in 22 games.</p>\n<p>Holding it down on the defensive end for Sparta, Hague owns the No. 1 goalkeeping mark in the Big Ten with 79 saves this year, putting him on a track for nine shutout performances in the 22 games he started for the Spartans. His nine blanks this season are tied for No. 9 in the nation among Division I goalies.</p>\n<p>Hague’s .840 save percentage is the best in the conference and No. 10 in the NCAA, while his .66 goals allowed per match is No. 2 in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>With a stout Spartans backline that only allows .77 goals per contest, the best way to slow down Michigan State is to limit its sharp attack.</p>\n<p>Yet with Ryan Sierakowski spearheading the attack and a fearsome duo in Barone and Jones at Sierakowski’s immediate disposal, this Spartan squad looks to ride its unforeseen tournament run to its first title in 50 years.</p>\n<p>The Michigan State Spartans will take on University of Akron in the first game of the Final Four on Dec. 7 at 5 p.m. at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

College Cup at Harder Stadium. Maryland comes into the matchup with an 11-6-4 record, while Indiana sports a 20-2-1 mark for the season.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers and the Terps are well-acquainted with one another as they have met twice already this season, with Indiana emerging victorious both times.</p>\n<p>The first meeting came in Bloomington, Ind., during Big Ten Conference play when the Hoosiers escaped with a 2-1 win, thanks to a last-minute goal by senior defenseman Andrew Gutman. The second matchup between the two teams came in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, during which Indiana again edged out the Terps in penalty kicks. Both matches came down to the wire and could have gone either way, save for a few miscues and lucky bounces that ultimately went the way of Indiana.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If the game on Friday is also a defensive battle, then it seems that the Hoosiers will have the advantage yet again. They haven’t allowed a goal so far in NCAA play and don’t show any signs of loosening their stringent backline.</p>\n<p>Indiana was just as stingy during conference play, in which they led the league in shutouts (12) and goals against (11). They haven’t lost since Oct. 3, and their effort on the defensive end is a big reason why.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and Gutman have been the main players commandeering defense this season, and both already have years of experience competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Gutman, in particular, has been the main leader of this Indiana squad. He hasn’t been just a defensive anchor; he also has been pulling his weight on the offensive end as well. The defender leads the team in goals (11) and is second in the Big Ten Conference.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers have a loaded roster that contains four first-team All-Big Ten players as well as four second-team players. Goalie Trey Muse has only allowed 11 goals on the season, putting him en route to be named the best goalie in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>Indiana has historically been a fixture in the College Cup. This is its second consecutive year qualifying for the Cup and its NCAA-record 20th time qualifying overall.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers last won the championship in 2012 — the most recent victory for any of the teams in the Final Four — and have nine titles overall.</p>\n<p>Even with such an illustrious history, this year’s team is definitely unique.</p>\n<p>“This group is a special one amongst the teams we have had,” Head Coach Todd Yeagley explained. “The numbers certainly speak for themselves. They’re very focused, just a wonderful group to coach.”</p>\n<p>So far this season, Indiana emerged victorious from the Big Ten Tournament with a 3-0 victory over Michigan in the title game and thus earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. After receiving a first-round bye, the Hoosiers flexed their muscles against UConn in their second-round matchup, winning the game 4-0 in a match that was never in doubt.</p>\n<p>Their second game of the tournament pitted them against Air Force, and the Hoosiers again got off to an early lead with two goals scored within the first 22 minutes of action. From there the Hoosiers rode their defense and held Air Force scoreless for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Indiana’s quarterfinal matchup came against its interstate rival and the No. 7 team in the country, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In their prior meeting, Indiana squeaked out a 2-1 overtime win in South Bend, and Notre Dame was looking for revenge. This game was a battle of two defenses, as neither team could put the ball in the net until the 63-minute mark when Austin Panchot gave the Hoosiers the go-ahead and ultimately the game-winning score.</p>\n<p>Maryland is led by a pair of first-team All-Big Ten players in senior midfielder and leading goal scorer Amar Sejdic and junior defenseman Donovan Pines. Although they are a familiar foe, Indiana is certainly not taking them lightly.</p>\n<p>“You can’t take one thing away from Maryland and feel like you’ve solved them,” Yeagley said. “I feel that is a strength of our team as well. There are a lot of mirroring qualities between these two teams.”</p>\n<p>These two squads have definitely earned the right to play on this stage, and if their prior meetings are any indication, we should prepare for another hard-fought battle that comes down to the wire.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/","id":1332,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1331,1330,1329],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bright Road Ahead as College Cup Returns to “Soccer Heaven”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MSoccer-vsCalPoly-10272018-SiavashGhadiri-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MSoccer-vsCalPoly-10272018-SiavashGhadiri-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week, thousands of fans will pour into Harder Stadium to watch a new NCAA men’s soccer champion be crowned.

But how did Santa Barbara </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a school more renowned for its academic prowess than its athletic department </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earn the chance to host the most important collegiate soccer game of the year?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large part, UCSB men’s soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg deserves credit for how far the Gauchos have come. Since his hiring in 1999, the Gauchos have made the postseason 14 times. In 2004, Santa Barbara shocked the nation by making the College Cup final, ultimately falling to Indiana in the final. In 2006, current LA Galaxy midfielder Chris Pontius and the Gauchos raised the trophy for the first time in program history after knocking off UCLA in the final.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, just before Santa Barbara hosted the college cup for the first time, ESPN.com writer Scott French described Harder Stadium as “Soccer Heaven.” At the time, the Gauchos easily led the NCAA in attendance, averaging more than 6,000 people per game. When UCSB took on UCLA in 2010 at Harder Stadium, the game drew nearly 16,000 people </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shattering the old NCAA record by almost 6,000 people. Even this year, in what was at times a trying season for the Gauchos, the team drew nearly 8,000 people for the rivalry game against Cal Poly.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big reason for the “Soccer Heaven” nickname stems from Santa Barbara’s location. With Harder Stadium less than a mile from the beach and almost always in ideal weather, it’s not much of a surprise that teams and their fans love coming to the West Coast for the College Cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hosting the College Cup further reinforces what students at UC Santa Barbara already know: soccer is an ingrained tradition at UCSB. For the second time in the last eight years, Santa Barbara will be the center of the college soccer world for an entire weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB hosted the final in 2010, nearly 10,000 fans came out to watch Akron defeat Louisville for its first-ever title. After the game, Akron Head Coach Caleb Porter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who would go on to coach the Portland Timbers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> praised the energy that the crowd brought to the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Santa Barbara hosting both the 2018 and 2020 College Cups, there has been some talk of Santa Barbara becoming the permanent host for this event. While that likely won’t happen, it proves that the NCAA recognizes the legitimacy of UCSB as a soccer program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the UCSB men’s soccer team will not be competing for the title this year. Despite going undefeated at home during the regular season, the Gauchos were upset in the first round of the Big West tournament by Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is reason for optimism for the future. By hosting the College Cup, which will be televised on ESPNU, UCSB will become more of a household name when it comes to soccer. Ideally, this will help Vom Steeg bring in highly-touted recruits and replenish the talent pool of the squad.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

The four wins were just enough for Akron to nab one of the 48 spots in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>After a play-in win against Rider University, Akron faced Syracuse, a team that defeated them earlier in the year, 3-1. Akron flipped the script, though, and won at top-seeded Wake Forest and ninth-ranked Stanford to launch them into the Final Four.</p>\n<p>That is the beauty of sports: One week the season feels over and yet, if the right changes are made, the next week you could be right back in the thick of things.</p>\n<p>“Going into the season, we had expectations of being here, but how the season went, around midseason it didn’t look like we would make the tournament, let alone make a run,” Head Coach Jared Embick said. “But we always knew we could get right back into it, and we did.”</p>\n<p>It also only feels fitting that Akron returns to the place it has won its only title — Santa Barbara — something coach Embick doesn’t take for granted.</p>\n<p>“Everyone gets excited to make it to the last week of the season, and it’s great to be in a sunny, wonderful place like Santa Barbara,” Embick said.</p>\n<p>The last time Akron was in Santa Barbara for the College Cup, the SB fans really seemed to gravitate toward the Zips. In fact, in 2010 when Akron scored its only goal to defeat Louisville, many fans threw tortillas onto the field, a celebration usually meant only for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Us mid-majors have to stick together,” Emrick said while laughing.</p>\n<p>“In all seriousness, it was a great memory and hopefully we can draw from that experience and pump our guys up. We are hoping some of the same people and a few others do the same thing this year.”</p>\n<p>In general, Akron also enjoys a lot of success in Santa Barbara. Last year, the Zips defeated the Gauchos 3-1 in a game that saw Akron then-forward Sam Gainford score two goals.</p>\n<p>“We consider this place our home away from home. Our guys have had success on this turf, and we are really excited to keep that up,” Embick said. “We always approach this place with good memories, and hopefully we use that to our advantage this weekend.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt Akron’s confidence is at an all-time high, and honestly, why shouldn’t it be?  The Zips have won eight straight matches, they have knocked off some of the best teams in the country to get to the Final Four and they are returning to a place in which they have had much success.</p>\n<p>It might be easy to get carried away and think Akron is destined to win, but coach Embick is not so quick to say so.</p>\n<p>“As a coach you always temper excitement, but given everything we have done this season we have proven we are capable of getting it done,” Embick said. “Some people tossed us aside earlier this year, and we have proven we deserve to be here, but now we have to get it done.”</p>\n<p>Akron first needs to reach its fourth final in program history by defeating Michigan State, a team that is making its own history by being in its first College Cup in 50 years. The Zips defeated the Spartans earlier this year, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Also, if you didn’t believe in coincidences enough, Akron knocked off the other Michigan team, the Wolverines, in 2010 before winning their first title. That same year, they also beat Michigan in the regular season, 7-1.</p>\n<p>“I have already told our guys about how we beat a team from Michigan first last time we were here and how funny everything seems to be playing out,” Embick said. “Hopefully that is a good omen, and hopefully we get it done.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Barbara had the privilege to host their first-ever NCAA College Cup. Despite some things not going as planned and some upgrades not being able to be finished in time, the event was a relative success.</p>\n<p>“We were asked back in 2010 to host in kind of a last-minute situation, and we sort of scrambled to get it done, but even today people look back at that college cup and hold it as a high watermark over the last 10-plus years,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>More than 9,600 people were packed in the stadium dubbed “Soccer Heaven” to witness Akron upset top-ranked Louisville 1-0. Now, as UCSB prepares to host the College Cup for the second time in school history, the university and its staff hope it can do an even better job.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s a great honor and a unique opportunity [to be the hosts of the college cup],” Vom Steeg said. “I love being a host, and I love the cycle of having one year off to relax and then getting another opportunity to do even better in 2020, but our focus this weekend is to do a good job.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg played a significant role in the College Cup making its way back to Santa Barbara. There were multiple reasons why vom Steeg felt he wanted the championship matches on his home turf.</p>\n<p>The first reason is that this is just the 10th time since 1959 (when the College Cup began) that it will be held on the West Coast and just the third since the turn of the century. Hosting the matches on the West Coast is great because usually, that means better weather in the winter, especially in a place like Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It’s really, really hard to have people come out in Philadelphia in the second week of December to watch Stanford and Indiana,” Vom Steeg said. “Great teams, great programs, but when it’s 20 degrees outside it is hard.”</p>\n<p>Even bigger than that, UCSB hopes to attract support for the College Cup being played at university campus stadiums instead of being held at big Major League Soccer (MLS) stadiums.</p>\n<p>“I understand why the Soccer Committee likes the MLS stadiums. They are usually in big cities next to big airports and they are made to hold big games, but over the last four years I have been one of the more vocal critics in that our championship doesn’t reflect our game,” vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Having participated in two College Cups himself, including UCSB’s historic 2006 championship, vom Steeg said he feels disappointed for coaches and athletes who work hard all year for a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the championship does not live up to the event.</p>\n<p>To vom Steeg’s point, the average attendance the past three championship games has been just over 5,300, much lower than UCSB’s 9,600-plus showing in 2010.</p>\n<p>Additionally, having such low attendance in big MLS stadiums makes for a much weaker atmosphere and feel to the game.</p>\n<p>In a site like UCSB’s Harder Stadium that seats about 16,500, according to UCSB’s Assistant Athletics Director for Communications Bill Mahoney, having about 9,600 fans will look full and help build a strong atmosphere for players and fans alike.</p>\n<p>But at a place like BBVA Compass Stadium, home of the Houston Dynamos and site of the 2016 College Cup Final, only 6,315 were in attendance. For a stadium seating 22,039, only about 29 percent of the stadium was full for a championship game.</p>\n<p>If the game was at a place like Harder, the stadium would’ve been at about 40 percent capacity. Not great, but still a huge difference, especially considering that vom Steeg and co. hope to garner a bigger attraction this year.</p>\n<p>“We are attempting to reverse the course of the last few years this weekend, and we are attempting to bring back the National Championship to a college campus and hopefully show everybody that this might be the better route,” vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>vom Steeg also said that even if the College Cup isn’t in Santa Barbara, as long as it is in a community that will support it and give the championship game the feel it deserves that would be a good thing.</p>\n<p>This year, in order to prepare for a good showing, UCSB has had to improve Harder Stadium quite a bit. Even though the Gauchos were hosts in 2010 vom Steeg notes that the past eight years very well could have been 20.</p>\n<p>“We literally had to start all over again. It takes a lot of work, but what we are hoping for this time around is being able to build off of this for the 2020 College Cup,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this process of hosting the College Cup, UCSB listed out 11 projects it wanted to get done, and vom Steeg said nine were able to be completed with the rest to be finished before the start of the next college season and certainly before the next College Cup.</p>\n<p>“When people show up to the field they are going to see Harder Stadium in the best shape it has ever been in, and a lot of these changes are permanent that our fans will be able to enjoy for years to come,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest improvements at Harder was the field,  investing $100,000 in it before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>Other changes include bringing in international goal posts, putting new MLS type benches, expanding benches, increasing seating area in the “gold” zone by about 125, a new sound system at the stadium, new sewer lines for the bathrooms, beautifying the entryway, expanding the press box for media and finishing painting both the inside and outside of the stadium.</p>\n<p>“The school really stepped up in helping improve the infrastructure of Harder, and it will go a long way,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>For 2020, some of the changes vom Steeg said UCSB will hope to implement is a new ticket booth, more improvements to the entryway, and the addition of a new video board.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend has a lot on the line for UCSB. Despite not being one of the final four teams, vom Steeg still sees both Friday and Sunday as huge opportunities to continue this course of action by having the College Cup at college campuses.</p>\n<p>“I certainly hope we at least match what we did in 2010, and I hope we put on a great event,” Vom Steeg said. “This weekend will mean a lot but also is a project because if this weekend goes great we know we can make it even better in 2020.”</p>\n<p>The College Cup will feature Michigan State, Akron, Indiana and Maryland. Michigan State will face Akron at 5 p.m. on Friday while Indiana and Maryland will play at 7:30 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p>The championship match will be played at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 9 at Harder between the two winners on Friday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

But when IU forward Griffin Dorsey chose to try and dribble out of the box instead of clearing the ball away, a Stanford attacker stole it and shot it just over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Trey Muse.</p>\n<p>Before they knew it, the season was over.</p>\n<p>It was a season that saw IU finish 18-1-6 and put together the fourth-longest shutout streak in NCAA history at 966:28 minutes. Just two key players left that team, and now 10 of IU’s 11 starters return in hopes of avenging that cold Sunday in Philadelphia on Dec. 10, 2017.</p>\n<p>From offense to defense this Hoosier team is filled with talent and built for success. There is no weak link on this team.</p>\n<p>Starting in the net, the sophomore goalkeeper has 30 shutouts in his two seasons at IU. Just last week, Muse made an incredible diving save to prevent Notre Dame from taking the lead 1-0 in the quarterfinals. Then there are IU’s two rocks in the backline in redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and freshman Jack Maher, who rarely let anyone sneak by them. The two outside backs are seniors Rece Buckmaster and Andrew Gutman. Both are quick and versatile in becoming offensively minded when the time is right. Gutman leads the team in goals with 11.</p>\n<p>Mix that in with the controlling midfielders that are redshirt senior Francesco Moore, senior Jeremiah Gutjahr, redshirt senior Trevor Swartz, redshirt sophomore Spencer Glass and redshirt senior Cory Thomas, who can all shift back when Buckmaster or Gutman push up, and you get a team that controls possession and allows very few chances.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the forwards — Dorsey, sophomore Justin Rennicks, senior Austin Panchot and redshirt sophomore A.J. Palazzolo. Panchot scored the game-winning goal against Notre Dame last week off a header from Gutman’s cross. Palazzolo is a big body that is dangerous on set pieces while Rennicks and Dorsey have the speed and talent to take any defender one-on-one.</p>\n<p>The makeup of this team is dangerous, and that’s why the Hoosiers are 20-2-1 this season. The last time the team lost was Oct. 3 against Kentucky, which was an uncharacteristic 3-0 defeat. In the 63 days since then, which has included 12 games, IU has only given up three goals.</p>\n<p>Also, since that loss, IU has scored 22 goals and been crowned Big Ten Champions — becoming the only team in conference history to go an undefeated 8-0 — and Big Ten Tournament Champions.</p>\n<p>Everything is coming together right now for the Hoosiers, and they are playing their best soccer.</p>\n<p>“We’re locked in as much as we’ve ever been,” Yeagley said on Tuesday before the team left for Santa Barbara, Calif. “That’s what you want: You want the team to find another gear in every phase of their game. I think we’re in that mode right now where everyone is locked in.”</p>\n<p>The redemption of this season wasn’t supposed to be beating Stanford. No, the redemption was to claim what the Hoosiers believe is rightfully theirs: the National Championship.</p>\n<p>Four teams and two games stand in IU’s way of accomplishing that goal. Akron, Michigan State, and Maryland are all deserving of spots in the College Cup, but there’s only one team who is so driven, so talented and so deserving of winning on Dec. 9, and that team hails from Bloomington, Indiana.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, redemption is within grasp of claiming the program’s ninth National Championship.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 14\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div id=\"attachment_85316\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"472085731\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85316\" data-attachment-id=\"85316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/v46r5uqjwzed5m3gd7ybuz2ude/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=1875%2C1250&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1875,1250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1875&amp;ssl=1 1875w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forward Vinicius Lansade celebrates after scoring his first career goal during Maryland’s 3-2 overtime win over Penn State at Ludwig Field on Oct. 23, 2018.<em> (Richard Moglen/The Diamondback)</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Terps Look To Finish The Season Strong With A Title</strong><br>\n<strong>Joe Catapano, <em>The Diamondback</em></strong></p>\n<p>Throw out the standings, the seedings, and the statistics. Forget that Maryland didn’t score for the first 476 minutes of the year, didn’t win until its fifth match and didn’t have a record that would even qualify for the NCAA tournament 12 games into the regular season.</p>\n<p>No. 11 seed Maryland’s campaign can be summarized using the cliché adage: “It’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.” And the Terps show no signs of ceasing their magical postseason — one that’s featured two road upsets without conceding a goal in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Sasho Cirovski’s Terps are just as capable of winning the national championship as any of the other College Cup participants. Despite a semifinals matchup against a team they haven’t beaten both times they’ve tried this year, the Terps’ season took a dramatic turn with a loss on Oct. 12 to Indiana.</p>\n<p>Maryland is 7-1-1 since falling to the Hoosiers with 18 seconds remaining in Bloomington. The impressive record is thanks to Andrew Gutman, who Cirovski continuously boasts is the best player in college soccer.</p>\n<p>Even after two convincing 2-0 performances over former ACC foes in NC State and No. 6 Duke, it was hard to see Maryland upsetting No. 3 Kentucky in the quarterfinals. The Wildcats hadn’t trailed, lost or been shut out at home all season.</p>\n<p>Maryland scored in the 29th minute and then held on for another 61 to accomplish all three feats. So now’s the time to refer back to my opening sentence: Through all the adversity this season, the Terps’ confidence has never wavered. They’re not surprised they’re playing in Santa Barbara, and understandably so.</p>\n<p>They knew going into the season that the offense would take time to develop after losing three of their top four goalscorers from 2017. Maryland has now scored in 10 straight games and has scored on its first shot on goal in all three tournament games.</p>\n<p>They knew they would become tougher playing through what’s now the No. 1 toughest schedule in the nation. Maryland only had two ranked wins in the regular season, but they now have three since the Big Ten tournament began.</p>\n<p>They knew they had a senior class that lost in the NCAA quarterfinals as freshmen, only to see first-round exits in the next two years. Maryland has now redeemed itself, but those seniors didn’t come to College Park to reach a College Cup — they came to win one.</p>\n<p>The means of doing so starts with the backline. It’s rare for a Maryland team, but its foundation is defense. Junior defenders Donovan Pines and Johannes Bergmann are an elite center back duo, complemented by outside backs senior Chase Gasper and sophomore Ben Di Rosa.</p>\n<p>If that stout four-man unit breaks down, goalkeeper redshirt junio Dayne St. Claire will make every save he’s supposed to and most ones he shouldn’t be expected to. The Terps switched to a two-center defensive midfielder formation midway through the year, which essentially adds senior Andrew Samuels and junior Eli Crognale as reinforcements to an already-impenetrable defense.</p>\n<p>Senior Amar Sejdic pushed forward as a center attacking midfielder, where he’s thrived for a team-leading seven goals this season. The three forwards up top have done enough to keep winning. Freshman William James Herve has the dribbling skills, junior Paul Bin has the speed and senior Sebastian Elney has the clutch gene.</p>\n<p>Let this serve as the final warning. Cirovski has called this season a redemption story, and with two previous heartbreaks against Indiana this year, the Hoosiers might be the penultimate victim in the Terps’ title tale.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_85315\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"863840015\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85315\" data-attachment-id=\"85315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/soccer-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=1000%2C664&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,664\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"soccer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85315\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Annie Barker / The State News</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>After five seasons of defeat, this is MSU’s moment</strong><br>\n<strong>Kara Keating, <em>The State News</em></strong></p>\n<p>When thinking about Michigan State athletics, the first thing that comes to mind is often the football team or the men’s basketball team. For other fans, they tend to point out the men’s soccer team, especially after they posted 14-4-4 in the regular season are beginning to be known as a powerhouse.</p>\n<p>For the first time in 50 years, the Spartans are making their appearance in the Final Four after losing players to injury, going through scoring droughts and being eliminated in the Elite Eight four times in the past five seasons. This is their chance to earn the victory they have been dreaming of. With Head Coach Damon Rensing at the helm since 2009, the team has a 2018 NCAA Tournament record of 11-5-3.</p>\n<p>The team has been named co-champions twice — once back in 1967 and again in 1968 — but this is their moment to shine and win it all as independent champions.</p>\n<p>The Spartans would defeat some of the top teams in the Big Ten Conference and in the nation, but it was merely talked about while being shadowed by the 7-5 football team and other major news surrounding the campus. Before the start of the season, MSU fans would support the soccer team and head to the free games on campus, but they never truly got the buzz that they are getting now from Spartan fans and the student section known as the Red Cedar Rowdies.</p>\n<p>After beating James Madison University last Saturday, the team is now seeing what impact they have made. While leaving a restaurant in town after a team meal, people began applauding, which is something the players have never experienced before.</p>\n<p>“That just hit home on just how much of an effect this team has had,” Rensing said.</p>\n<p>Not only do the fans in East Lansing want another National Championship for their town, but so do these players. Senior forward Ryan Sierakowski and his senior classmates made this their goal starting their freshmen year and are determined to make it there.</p>\n<p>This season Sierakowski is close to becoming the first Spartan player to lead the team in points in his four seasons in the green and white uniform, and he is ranked No. 10 all-time in scoring, putting up 82 points in 81 games.</p>\n<p>The offense isn’t the only ones hitting the back of the net, though. Three MSU defenders have scored a total of five goals together throughout the season: redshirt sophomore Patrick Nielsen, junior Michael Wetungu and senior John Freitag.</p>\n<p>Another strong advantage for this tournament is the familiar faces that they will come to play against in the tournament. To start the Final Four off, they will take on Akron for the second time this season after losing to the Zips 2-1, but they feel ready to compete after regaining players back from injuries.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have to watch film,” Rensing said. “We know Akron, and they know us … You’d rather dance with the devil you know than the one you don’t know.”</p>\n<p>Going from multiple NCAA tournament runs and constant letdowns before making it to the Final Four, this team has come together for not only the fans but also for their former teammates to earn them the title that they know they deserve.</p>\n<p>Whether they become National Champions or lose to Akron on Friday night, Michigan State will become a little more focused on what the soccer team will bring for years to come.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

in his twentieth year as head coach of the UCSB men’s soccer program, set down his keys on the table in the College Cup room situated under the east end of a now-empty Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>He faced the local media to discuss all that went wrong in their Big West Tournament quarterfinal versus Cal State Fullerton, which saw the visiting Titans advance to the semifinal after a penalty kick shootout.</p>\n<p>These season-ending press conferences have become par for the course for Vom Steeg and the Gauchos over the past three years as they’ve fallen short of reaching the NCAA Tournament in either the quarterfinal or semifinal stages of the Big West Conference Tournament.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) {

drought of this length is rare.</p>\n<p>In the three years since UCSB’s last appearance in the NCAA Tournament when they fell to Clemson in the Round of 16, each season’s Gaucho team has seen their campaign end in disappointment come conference tournament time. This year’s Gauchos became the latest to join that group.</p>\n<p>As unsuccessful as the Gauchos have been in recent times, there’s a recipe for success to make it back to the grand stage of the College Cup. It’s simple on the surface, but it wouldn’t be the crown jewel of college soccer if it didn’t require perfect execution by the four teams that make it that far.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics: Outsmarting the Opponent</strong></p>\n<p><em>“That’s been our issue all year. What’s been that ‘something different’ that can get us a goal?”</em></p>\n<p>vom Steeg has the expertise and know-how to have the upper hand against any opponent, but as good a problem as it is to have so much talent at his disposal, it was also a nightmare to figure out what formation would get the most out of his team.</p>\n<p>Throughout, he worked with four different formations: first a 4-2-3-1, then a 3-5-2, onto a 4-4-2, and toward the end of the season shades of a 4-3-3.</p>\n<p>An argument can be made that UCSB played the best soccer of its season in any of the formations, but once the team got slightly exposed in one setup it was on to the next one.</p>\n<p>This constant tinkering hampered players who excelled in certain roles in one formation and struggled in others, and there was no regularity for the team to grow into a formation as a unit.</p>\n<p>One such example is senior defender and team captain Jan Ilskens. If he could be listed as a utility man, that would be a better descriptor since he’s been deployed as a center back, defensive midfielder, right back and even as a striker in the past two years.</p>\n<p>After starting the season as a right back in the 4-2-3-1, he moved to right center back in the 3-5-2. With the wingback spots occupied in the 4-4-2 by juniors Ignacio Tellechea and Noah Billingsley, he began to get some playing time up top to support sophomore Rodney Michael in the forward lines. Playing out of position in attack didn’t suit him, so he moved back into the defensive midfield in the 4-3-3.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency: Establishing Your Roles</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us. When we scored goals, it usually happened in bunches.”</em></p>\n<p>The 2018 Gauchos certainly did score in bunches: Five times this year they managed to score multiple goals within a five-minute span. In the game against CSUN, it was vom Steeg’s tactical switch at halftime that worked to their favor as they scored a trio of goals in just seven minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet it was hard to spread the goals around the team and even harder to score on the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had just five players with multiple goals on the season. Of those five, freshman forward Carter Clemmensen’s goals were both in the opening weekend of play, and sophomore forward Kaya Fabbretti didn’t join the ranks until the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s road woes were well-documented this season, but one statistic still seems unbelievable until it’s checked against the team’s results: the Gauchos failed to score in each of their six road losses.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos scored, they got results. When they didn’t, they lost.</p>\n<p>It should be no surprise that Michael had a goal and two assists in the road win at New Mexico and draw at UC Irvine. This year’s team relied heavily on the sophomore and oftentimes struggled to find a Plan B.</p>\n<p>This was the result of an ever-shifting midfield and attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The backline became solidified very early on in the season, but each game saw a rotating cast providing support for Michael and Billingsley, seemingly the only two regulars in the attacking half of the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>UCSB played best when midfielders like junior Sahid Conteh and Fabbretti made deep runs and were able to contribute to the attack. When there’s so much talent and so many different styles of play vying for such few spots on the field, it can be difficult to implement one method of play over another. Injuries and suspensions didn’t help vom Steeg’s case either.</p>\n<p>Figuring out the perfect combination in both areas will be the biggest challenge for the Gaucho coaching staff heading into next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Luck: What Every Champion Needs</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Soccer is a sport that if you don’t feel like you’re going to score, then you don’t let the other team score, and then you leave it to the penalty spot and see what happens.”</em></p>\n<p>Part of the reason why UCSB hasn’t been able to make it back to the NCAA Tournament is simply down to luck.</p>\n<p>In any tournament setting, especially one with as small a sample size as three games like in the Big West Tournament, a deflection or a shot that hits the post or crossbar can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>\n<p>In this year’s quarterfinal against Fullerton, UCSB dominated possession in the second half of the game, but sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg missed an open shot, and Michael failed to convert on an opportunity late in extra time.</p>\n<p>Lady (Bad) Luck struck again in the penalty shootout when junior forward Ignacio Tellechea hit the crossbar, ironically after scoring his first goal of the season earlier in the match to get them that far.</p>\n<p>Luck isn’t just a big factor in the conference tournament; the landscape in the Big West would have looked completely different if Michael hadn’t missed his penalty in the ninth minute at UC Irvine and the Gauchos didn’t have to come from behind to secure the 2-2 draw. If anything, it’s as important considering the college soccer season features so many games in such a small window.</p>\n<p>With so many players being introduced into the fold, it may have been far-fetched to think that everything would come together in just one year.</p>\n<p>Yet the hope remains. If Tim Vom Steeg gets all of this right and the Gauchos can get some luck on their side, the next trip to the College Cup might not be far off.</p>\n<p><em>Arthur Wilkie is the Sports Director at

After a dominant 2017 season in which they won the M.A.C. conference championship yet eventually fell to No. 1 Stanford in the College Cup Semifinals, expectations were high heading into the 2018 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Zips didn’t quite start off the season the way they wanted to. Early non-conference losses to NC State, Seattle University and Washington didn’t have too much of an effect on Akron’s overall ranking, but the team still didn’t have a winning record a month into the season.</p>\n<p>A quick three-game win streak at the end of September, along with big wins over ranked opponents Michigan State and Creighton in early October helped the Zips evade the bottom of the M.A.C. standings.</p>\n<p>They ended the conference season with a 1-0 win over SIU Edwardsville and a fourth-place finish in the conference to go along with their No. 14 national rank. Even though three teams finished ahead of the Zips in total points, they finished the season leading the conference in goals (42), shutouts (8) and assists (22).</p>\n<p>“We had our ups and downs during the season,” explained senior goalie Ben Lundt. “But when we realized that we [just had to] take every game 90 minutes [at a time], we realized that we could beat any team anywhere.”</p>\n<p>Akron floated through their conference tournament, outscoring their opponents 8-2 and earning a spot in the NCAA College Cup. The Zips dominated both Rider University and No. 20 Syracuse 3-1 in their first two games. They then squeaked by No. 2 Wake Forest 1-0 to set up an Elite Eight matchup with the No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal that had knocked them out of the tournament the year before. Akron ended up getting their revenge and beating the Cardinal 3-2 to advance to the Semifinals where they are now set to take on a familiar foe in Michigan State.</p>\n<p>A player to watch in this matchup will be Akron sophomore forward David Egbo. Egbo led the team and conference in both goals (12) and overall points (29), and he will be looking to make a mark in the late stages of the College Cup for the first time in his young career.</p>\n<p>The forward made a monstrous improvement of 11 goals and one assist from his freshman year, and although he hasn’t had a breakout game so far in the postseason, he definitely is due.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Marcel Zajac has also been dominant on the offensive end for the Zips. Although he is second in the conference in goals (10) only behind his teammate Egbo, Zajac has also taken on the mantle of a playmaker.</p>\n<p>The forward led the team in assists this year and was tied for fourth in the conference (8). Although his goal total shows that he is capable of taking and making shots on his own, Zajac has seemingly unlocked another level to this Akron offense by focusing on being a distributor. With Egbo up top ready to knock in any ball close to the goal, Zajac has made sure that his teammates stay involved as well as maintained the synergy between the forwards and midfielders on his team.</p>\n<p>This teamwide synergy has been one of Akron’s greatest strengths all season. The team’s game-winning goal last week against Stanford went viral on Twitter, not because of the goal itself, but because of the 34 consecutive passes leading up to it.</p>\n<p>“The strength [of this team] is their collective spirit,” Head Coach Jared Embick explained in his pre-Cup press conference. “They’re really together, and they fight like heck out there. When they do that, the talent comes through. When they focus on that fighting spirit and being a team, you see what we could do out there.”</p>\n<p>One drawback to this focus on a teamwide offense and more European-style passing is that the Zips’ goal scoring can stagnate when faced with a defense that is content with letting them play with the ball. Against a hungry Michigan State squad making their first appearance in the Final Four in 50 years, Akron will have to be able to push the place and play rougher than usual.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Zips seem like a good bet to win the College Cup. The combination of Final Four experience that the players from last year’s team have with breakout performances by their young stars this year makes this one of the most balanced teams in the country.</p>\n<p>As they get set to take on a familiar foe in an unfamiliar environment, Akron has a special chance for a storybook ending to a decade of dominance.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
