USD is currently 3-2-1 on the season, and is unranked in national polls.</p>\n<p>The Torero offense has been the key to the team’s success so far this season, as the squad has scored an average of three goals per game, compared to its opponent’s 1.33.</p>\n<p>Battling USD’s front line will be the Gaucho defense, which through the first six games has held opponents to just five scored goals, including three shut outs on the season and a recent streak of four unbeaten games. Junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt has started all six games for the Gauchos thus far this season and has compiled a save percentage of .714.</p>\n<p>“The defense communicates very well with me,” Grandt said. “This makes the job easier. [Senior midfielder James] Kiffe is pretty important for the defense, he covers our center backs and he’ll be a help for both games this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Grandt, a transfer student from Tyler Junior College in Texas, helped his junior college team win consecutive national championships in 2009 and 2010. Grandt was an NSCAA first team All-American in 2010, and will be playing on Friday in his first Division-I home game while school is in session.</p>\n<p>“I was pretty excited about the 4,000 people that showed up when we played Westmont,” Grandt said. “The bigger crowd Friday will be a huge advantage for us.”</p>\n<p>Sunday’s matchup against Sacramento State may offer more excitement on the offensive side of the field. Two Sac State players, Junior defender Matt Linenberger and sophomore forward Isaac Ikyurav, have each scored six goals apiece over the course of the team’s six games this year.</p>\n<p>“It’ll be a very defensive game,” Silva said. “We have to try to not let their forwards score and put some away ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Next year, Sac State will be moving from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation into the Big West conference, joining UCSB in the league for the first time. The Hornets won the MPSF league championship last season, and will be competing against Big West foe UC Davis this weekend as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be good to see how they play, and how they’ll be playing in conference for the next few years,” Silva said.</p>\n<p>The last time UCSB had a Friday and Sunday schedule during one weekend, the Gauchos finished with a 2-0 victory against West Virginia and a 0-0 draw against Villanova.</p>\n<p>“These next games are really important to us,” Silva said. “These are really good teams that we’re gonna play.”</p>\n<p>Two conference games follow this weekend’s match ups, with one of the biggest games coming against reigning NCAA champion Akron on October 5 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is on the Friday game against San Diego,” Grandt said.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game against USD will feature a pregame giveaway of free Gaucho Loco T-shirts to UCSB students. Sunday’s game against Sac State is set for 5pm kickoff. Today’s match against San Diego will begin at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41166\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-23/gauchos-face-san-diego-friday-sac-state-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41166\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-23/gauchos-face-san-diego-friday-sac-state-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-23/gauchos-face-san-diego-friday-sac-state-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-23/gauchos-face-san-diego-friday-sac-state-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-23/gauchos-face-san-diego-friday-sac-state-sunday/","id":1700,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1699,1698,1697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Tie Visiting Villanova","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The result of Sunday’s game against visiting Villanova was not the shutout that the UCSB men’s soccer team was hoping for.

The fifth minute saw Villanova junior midfielder Emerson Lawrence miss a shot from less than 20 yards out, giving junior Gaucho goalkeeper André Grandt the first of his four total saves of the game.</p>\n<p>“André is playing very well,” David said. “He had some great saves and really helped our</p>\n<p>backline on defense.” Senior midfielder Luis Silva</p>\n<p>gave UCSB its first opportunity to score on goal in the 18th minute with a centered pass to senior midfielder James Kiffe on a free kick. Kiffe’s shot from 30 yards out was deflected by the Villanova goalkeeper, leaving the score knotted at 0-0.</p>\n<p>Villanova nearly took the lead just five minutes later but was thwarted twice by the Gaucho defense. Grandt was drawn out of the goal as a Villanova forward took a shot from the left side of the box. UCSB sophomore defender Peter Schmetz immediately cleared the ball from the goal line. Moments later there was another quick shot by the Villanova offense, this time def lecting off the right goal post.</p>\n<p>A handball by the Wildcat defense in front of the Villanova goal gave UCSB its best chance to take the lead. Silva’s penalty shot easily found the back of the net, but was recalled due to an encroachment call on the UCSB front line. Silva’s makeup attempt was wide left, leaving the score at 0-0 going into the half.</p>\n<p>“I was going to the same side</p>\n<p>[on the re-kick],” Silva said. “But I kind of hesitated and hit the post. It was unfortunate for us.”</p>\n<p>The second half did not offer as many opportunities for either team, as both sides seemed to tighten their ranks defensively. A seemingly wide-open shot by sophomore forward David Opoku sailed just high of the goal post, and minutes later a header by senior midfielder Gaby Okito was tipped away by the Villanova goalkeeper in the last four minutes.</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot Villanova 3-2 in the overtime minutes, yet neither squad could break the draw. The Gauchos also led Villanova in total shots throughout the game, 15-11. Silva led the team with five shots, two of which were on goal.

Junior midfielder Dyanne Anderson’s team-leading fourth goal of the season solidified the victory for the Gauchos in the 57th minute, putting the team up 2-0. Sunday’s match proved to be a harder task for the Gauchos, as Michigan State was led by junior forward Olivia Stander’s two goals. Freshman forward Indiana Mead converted on a chance to tie the game for UCSB with her first career goal in the 30th minute, but the Spartans responded by ringing off three straight goals of their own. Overall, UCSB was out-shot 14-7 during the 6-3 Spartan victory.</p>\n<p>“We just came up against a very good team in Michigan State,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>UCSB sophomore goalkeeper Makenna Henry made three saves on seven shots on goal over the weekend. Despite their 34 shots over the weekend with 13 on goal, the Gauchos scored only three goals.</p>\n<p>“We did really well because we got so many shots off,” Anderson said. “We just need to work on getting those shots in. Offensively we did really well, we just need to now work on getting them in the back of the net.”</p>\n<p>Battling the injury bug, the defense proved resilient this weekend, finally getting key players back on the field. Senior defenders Nicole Romanowski and Alyssa Benjamin, both out last week with injuries, made their way back to the pitch in Michigan this weekend.</p>\n<p>“We are slowly but surely getting healthy again,” Stumpf said. “I’m really happy with where we’re at right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home when they host No. 9 Pepperdine on Friday and Nevada on Sunday. Kickoff on Friday is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/ucsb-splits-pair-games-weeekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/ucsb-splits-pair-games-weeekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/ucsb-splits-pair-games-weeekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/ucsb-splits-pair-games-weeekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/ucsb-splits-pair-games-weeekend/","id":1697,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1696,1695,1694],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Dominates in Preseason Exhibition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The large number of tortillas flying onto the field made the match seem like a regular season rivalry game, yet the UCSB men’s soccer team’s 6-1 victory over Westmont College this past Saturday se...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The large number of tortillas flying onto the field made the match seem like a regular season rivalry game, yet the UCSB men’s soccer team’s 6-1 victory over Westmont College this past Saturday served as the Gauchos’ lone preseason match of the year.</p>\n<p>“I was excited to see this group play tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “There were a lot of good performances.”</p>\n<p>Though the first shot on goal came from a Westmont attack less than two minutes into the first half, it was the only attempt by the Warriors through the first 45 minutes.

With the team’s latest victory over California, Akron matched the national record of going unbeaten in 39 straight home matches, a record set by Tulsa from 1988 to 1992. Akron is 37-0-3 in a stretch of home contests dating back to the 2008 season.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Zips, they will be traveling to Santa Barbara for the Final Four — far away from their own friendly confines of Lee R.

The nation’s leader in goals from a year ago, Bunbury was selected fourth overall by the Kansas City Wizards.</p>\n<p>This year, a newcomer has spearheaded the Akron offensive attack. Freshman forward Darren Mattocks has made an immediate impact, scoring 18 goals — good for third in the nation — in 23 games this season and postseason to help replace Bunbury. Mattocks has posted six goals and three assists in the last five games, including a goal and an assist in the Akron’s 2-1 win over #14 seed Indiana in the Elite Eight.</p>\n<p>The Zips secured a trip to Santa Barbara for the Final Four last Saturday with win over #6 seeded California. After playing to a 3-3 tie in regulation, Akron junior defender Kofi Sarkodie scored the game-winning goal on a penalty kick that went off the fingertips of Cal goalkeeper David Bingham and into the upper right corner of the goal to give the Zips the 3-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>To make the Final Four, Akron had to overcome adversity that they had rarely seen this year to beat Cal. For the first time all season, the Zips found themselves trailing in a home game after the Golden Bears scored in the 30th minute. Akron responded quickly, however, and a goal by junior midfielder Michael Nanchoff knotted the match at 1-1. Just 34 seconds later, Akron jumped out to a 2-1 lead after a costly turnover by Cal led to a goal by sophomore midfielder Scott Caldwell on an assist from senior midfielder Anthony Ampaipitakwong. The goal was Caldwell’s fourth of his career — all coming during this year’s postseason run.</p>\n<p>Late in regulation, the Zips were forced to overcome adversity once again when California forward John Fitzpatrick forced overtime by scoring the equalizer at 3-3 with just 91 seconds remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>After playing to a 3-3 tie at the end of the second overtime period, Akron goalkeeper David Meves made a pair of huge saves and Sarkodie, Akron’s final shooter, netted the decisive blow.</p>\n<p>The Zips will face the 10th seeded University of Michigan in the national semifinals, after the Wolverines bested the 2nd seeded Maryland Terps 3-2 in overtime.</p>\n<p>Michigan is not an unfamiliar foe to Akron. Earlier this season, on Oct. 19, the Zips dominated the Wolverines at home in a 7-1 victory. The loss was not only Michigan’s last, but also by far the team’s worst.</p>\n<p>The key for Akron may be the offense. The Zips are 65-0-2 when they score at least two goals in a match during Caleb Porter’s five years as head coach.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Meram has now scored in nine consecutive games for the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>But Maryland fought back on their home turf and tied the match in the 79th minute. After a scoreless first overtime, sophomore midfielder Hamoody Saad made a run up the left side and fed a pass to freshman midfielder Fabio Pereira, who notched the game-winner into the bottom right of the cage in the fourth minute of the second overtime.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Soony Saad leads the team with 19 goals scored. Meram, who plays up front alongside Saad in Michigan’s 4-4-2 formation, has scored 16 goals and leads the team with eight assists.</p>\n<p>“Meram is the hottest player in the nation right now,” Burns said. “He has a lot of MLS interest.

They gradually climbed the rankings.</p>\n<p>The team won the Big East Tournament over Providence in a penalty kick shootout. Junior forward Colin Rolfe leads the Cardinals’ offensive attack with nine goals and seven assists this season.</p>\n<p>“He has made a difference not only with his goal scoring, but he has created opportunities as well,” Lolla said. “He’s a lot for defenses to handle.”</p>\n<p>He is closely followed by junior midfielder Nick DeLeon and freshman midfielder Dylan Mares, who have each added another six goals and three assists to balance out the Louisville attack.</p>\n<p>Along with redshirt junior goalkeeper Andre Boudreaux, who has allowed .74 goals a match on average, the Cardinals have outscored opponents 47-17 this season.</p>\n<p>After closing out the regular season and Big East playoffs undefeated, the Cardinals earned a seed into the national tournament and skipped the first round of play. In the next round, they faced the College of Charleston, who gave the top seed quite a game. The Cougars stayed neck and neck with the Cardinals throughout the entire match before the Cardinals scored twice in the last six minutes of play to seal a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>In front of a University of Kentucky record crowd of 5,562 (an insignificant number compared to the UCSB crowds at Harder), Louisville broke a 1-1 tie in the 63rd minute to advance to the quarterfinals against UCLA — a 5-4 victory that was arguably the most exciting match of the tournament.</p>\n<p>The quarterfinal game between perennial powerhouse UCLA and Louisville may have been the most exciting game in the NCAA tournament this year and has provided the most goals thus far. UCLA struck first in the 8th minute as junior forward Eder Arreola slid a ball past Bourdeaux, and the Cardinals found themselves trailing for the first time in the tournament.</p>\n<p>With just one minute remaining in regulation and the score tied 4-4 against UCLA, freshman forward Aaron Horton dribbled his way through an exhausted Bruin defense to score, giving the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and a ticket to the College Cup in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Louisville defines itself by its resiliency. The team has been to five overtime games this season and won three of them. Its balance of both attack and defense makes Louisville a formidable opponent.</p>\n<p>“It’s a product of being fit enough and having depth,” Lolla said.</p>\n<p>Their next opponent should prove to be another test. North Carolina (16-3-4 overall) is making its third consecutive College Cup appearance.</p>\n<p>“[North Carolina is] a very talented team,” Lolla said. “They’re very technically gifted and [deserve] to be in the Final Four.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30809\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/college-cup-team-previews-1-louisville-cardinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30809\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/college-cup-team-previews-1-louisville-cardinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/college-cup-team-previews-1-louisville-cardinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/college-cup-team-previews-1-louisville-cardinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/college-cup-team-previews-1-louisville-cardinals/","id":1322,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[1321,1320,1319],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Soccer: Cultivating a Legacy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a fan of UCSB soccer, it would be easy to get used to the success: nine consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament, a National Championship in 2006, 16 All-Americans and 14 current professional playe...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As a fan of UCSB soccer, it would be easy to get used to the success: nine consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament, a National Championship in 2006, 16 All-Americans and 14 current professional players.

In his first game ever as head coach, he took a 2-0 win over conference rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He immediately turned things around,” UCSB Assistant Athletics Director Bill Mahoney said. “It was pretty amazing. His teams bring the same intensity to the field that he brings as a coach on an everyday basis. He recruited better players, compiled a really good coaching staff and it was night and day. Everything. You could tell that the players believed in themselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB won 13 games in 1999 — only the third time the team had met that win total in the school’s program’s 33-year history. When he arrived, Vom Steeg set a goal of five years before the team would be competing for a National Championship. Sure enough, by 2004, he was at the helm of the best team he had ever coached, poised to make some noise in the NCAA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the squad lost the College Cup championship game to Indiana in penalty kicks after dominating possession and shot numbers through regulation.</p>\n<p>“Someone tell me that we lost,” Vom Steeg told the press after the game. “It’s disappointing because I thought we played so well. Not in my wildest dreams did I think we could play that well against that team over the course of 110 minutes, so I thought it was a great performance.”</p>\n<p>Two years later, the team would still be reeling, opening the 2006 season with a 7-6 record midway through the 2006 season. Before Vom Steeg, the team would have rolled over and given up on a season going nowhere. For those Gauchos, though, giving up was not an option.</p>\n<p>“They decided as a group that they didn’t want their careers to end, so the players decided we were going to do something different,” Vom Steeg explained. “We just started playing better, and we eventually caught fire.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rode that heat all the way to 11 wins in 12 games, including six in a row on the way to a second national championship appearance. This time, they took down UCLA 2-1 for the program’s first College Cup victory.</p>\n<p>“It was more than just a win,” defender Andy Iro, who currently plays for the Columbus Crew in the MLS, told the Daily Nexus after the match. “A lot of guys and coaches came through here and this is a culmination of all of this.”</p>\n<p>Since 2007, UCSB has led the nation in attendance every year, including setting an all-time record for an on-campus site when 15,896 Gaucho faithfuls attended a match against the Bruins this season.</p>\n<p>With wins in that match, as well as against Duke, both in front of national television cameras, the 2010 team looked ready to pick up the intensity again, with a chance to play a championship game in front of the largest home crowd in the country. Like the 2006 team, Vom Steeg’s group faced a less than ideal start.</p>\n<p>“Any time you start at 0-2-2, you can self-destruct and doubt yourself,” Vom Steeg said. “But we believed we were destined to do other things.”</p>\n<p>Again, the team recovered, managing to finish the regular season 12-4-3. In the first round of the NCAAs, the team cruised to a first-round win over Denver before falling to UC Berkeley in overtime. In the 24th minute of regulation, a controversial red card called against junior midfielder Luis Silva brought the Gauchos a man down for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>“It’s been very difficult on the coaching staff, on the players and difficult certainly for a lot of our fans,” Vom Steeg said of the early exit. “When things like this happen, all you can really do is channel that energy into your team, into helping your players. Any time negative things happen, it brings your group closer together.”</p>\n<p>After losing just three seniors, UCSB is already looking ahead to next year.</p>\n<p>“If anything, this is a team that I wouldn’t want to play next year,” Vom Steeg said. “We are unbelievably motivated. I think this is as motivated a group as you’re going to get.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/","id":1297,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1296,1295,1294],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"College Cup Team Previews: #4 North Carolina Tar Heels","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sometimes a victory takes playing even more than the usual 90 minutes.

It will also be the third year in a row that North Carolina faces a top seed in the same stage of the tournament. Last year’s semifinal game against top-ranked Akron came down to penalty kicks, but UNC was outscored 5-4.</p>\n<p>Contrary to its tournament games thus far, North Carolina was able to finish the majority of its league games this season without the use of overtime, and has played in just two games that have been overtime decisions: the first a 2-1 win against Wofford as well as a 1-1 double overtime tie against Boston College. Of its 13 league victories, 10 have been decided by one goal. The close margins of victory provide UNC with the important experience of being forced to perform under pressure, a trait it has used to its advantage during this year’s numerous penalty-kick shootouts.</p>\n<p>Also included in the 13 league wins are eight shutout victories, proof that the Tar Heels’ stifling defensive presence has been a major part of the team’s success. A 2-1 defeat suffered against Old Dominion early in the season was the only loss for North Carolina in ACC play.</p>\n<p>“It was a sloppy game; we didn’t compete well,” Bolowich said. “It was a wakeup call.”</p>\n<p>Still, the Tar Heels entered the ACC tournament on a five-game win streak. Its dominant defensive play was showcased in a 4-0 shutout against NC State and a 1-0 victory over Boston College.</p>\n<p>“Any team has good offense,” Bolowich said. “Our big strength all season has been defense.”</p>\n<p>The Tar Heels were upset by Maryland 1-0 in the ACC championship game, but managed enough quality wins to earn the fourth-seed in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“Records are meaningless at this point,” Bolowich said. “The playing field is level now.”</p>\n<p>All of North Carolina’s College Cup tournament games have been played at Fetzer Field on the campus of UNC. Friday’s match against Louisville will be its first away from home. Traveling to Santa Barbara will be a homecoming of sorts for sophomore defender Jordan Gafa, senior midfielder Michael Farfan and senior defender Jalil Anibaba, all of whom hail from California.</p>\n<p>“It’s a neutral site,” Anibaba said. “It’s about adapting as quick as we can and being ready to perform.”</p>\n<p>UNC will need to continue its strong performance on the defensive end of the field against the top-seeded Cardinals, which has scored more goals during regulation through its first three games than any other team in this year’s tournament. With a backfield led by Anibaba and sophomore goalkeeper Scott Goodwin, UNC will look to contain the Louisville offense en route to the College Cup championship, no matter how long it takes.</p>\n<p>“It helps to know that we’re fit enough and can go 110 minutes,” Farfan said. “We know that we can win in penalty kicks if the game ends in a tie.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tetteh also changed his jersey due to blood stains from a gash on his forehead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One card, dealt in the 24th minute on a ball contested at midfield by UCSB junior midfielder Luis Silva proved to be a game-changer.</p>\n<p>Silva slid at the ball while the Golden Bears’ Servando Carrasco tried to corral it, resulting in an altercation in which Carrasco shoved Silva to the ground. Carrasco dropped to the ground shortly after. Silva received a red card and an ejection, while Carrasco received a yellow, forcing UCSB to play the remainder of the match one player down. The call was hotly contested by the Gaucho bench and coaching staff, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a regular physical game,” Carrasco said of his run-in with Silva. “We both wanted to win, he came in studs up and he got a red card and we played on. There’s nothing I can say about that. I was mad, but it’s all part of the game.”</p>\n<p>Despite Silva’s absence on the field, UCSB still outshot the Bears in the first half six to five and finished the game with 16, nine on goal. One of those shots came in the second half off the foot of Tetteh, which he powered left past the outstretched arms of Berkeley’s goalkeeper David Bingham in the 81st minute.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes when you go a man down, you actually play a little bit better,” Cal Head Coach Kevin Grimes said. “You have to work that much harder.”</p>\n<p>A called Gaucho handball in the box led to a penalty kick from Carrasco in the 88th minute. Carrasco, in a one-on-one situation with UCSB’s goalkeeper, senior Sam Hayden, managed to put the ball in the back of the net to even the score at one goal apiece.</p>\n<p>In overtime, Berkeley’s Davis Paul was able to keep his team’s hopes alive. Paul took a pass in the box and caught Hayden out of position with only two seconds remaining in the first overtime period after Hayden attempted to break up the play on the pass.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s early exit from the NCAA playoffs comes in a year when the College Cup — soccer’s version of the Final Four — is to be held in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The idea of playing in Santa Barbara in front of 15 or 16,000 people drove this group and drove the coaching staff,” Vom Steeg said. “We weren’t going to let anything stand in our way, and today was something we couldn’t help.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finish their season at 14-5-3, having made their ninth straight NCAA appearance. The squad’s three seniors, Hayden, Boxall and forward Joe Eubanks also closed out their careers in Gaucho blue on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“To have all those factors against us and still dominate as we did, to outplay Cal at their home, we’re proud of how we played,” Boxall said. “But the most important thing is the result and obviously that didn’t go our way.”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s post-game press conference dealt largely with the controversial calls on the field and his distaste with the NCAA officiating standards.</p>\n<p>“You talk about controlling what you can control, and my guys played their hearts out with a man down,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Cal now moves on to play Brown next Sunday in the tournament’s third round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/","id":1760,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1759,1758,1757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bring on the Golden Bears","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If every match of the postseason goes like last night’s, Waid Ibrahim’s pacemaker is going to need replacing.

Luckily for the Gauchos, Ibrahim had other plans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’m just glad tonight I was able to go in and score that goal,” Ibrahim said. “I was sitting there and I knew that if I went in I would have to get a goal because I didn’t know what would happen after that. I knew that this was not the end of our season.”</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Danny Barrera notched the assist on the play, gathering a cross before sending it to Ibrahim with a shot straight at Denver’s 6’5” goalkeeper Joe Willis.</p>\n<p>“I was running at [the Denver defender] and he hesitated, so I just poked it and it went right to Waid,” Barrera said. “He knows how to finish a ball. To have someone so talented and not be able to play, I’m glad tonight he could contribute. It’s really great for everyone that he knows he can do something for us in the last five minutes, I’m glad it was him.”</p>\n<p>The box score tells the same story it has all year for UCSB: a possession domination leading to tired legs for their opposition and a late victory. Last night, the Gauchos put up 31 shots, which ties the season high they set against Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 6. Denver, on the other hand, managed just four shots, only one of them on goal.</p>\n<p>“I thought we lost to a very good UCSB team tonight,” Denver Head Coach Bobby Muuss said. “It took a very good goal to beat us. We’re down a little bit, but I’m proud of the way the guys worked together, and I think it’s something to build upon. The future’s very bright for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos’ focus turns to Sunday, when they travel north to take on UC Berkeley, which had a first-round bye. After last night’s marathon match, fatigue could pose a challenge to the team, with the added challenge of forecasted rain and temperatures dipping into the 40s.</p>\n<p>“It will be a test of us to go up there and go find something,” Vom Steeg said. “Now you’ve been tested, you’ve tasted defeat right in front of you and you found a way to win a game. We go up to Cal with very little to lose. We know we can play with anybody.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears (12-2-3) hold a 15-11-3 record against UCSB in the all-time series, with the last meeting between the two ending in a 3-2 double overtime Cal victory in 2008. The squad, like Denver, fields a strong defense, one that has given up only 13 goals all year.</p>\n<p>“I’m fairly familiar with Cal,” Vom Steeg said. “The names, numbers and faces will change, but how they play really does not. They’re very good in the back, very disciplined and have a very good goalie. That’s Cal.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff on Sunday is set for 1:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/","id":1740,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1739,1738,1737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Back Line Looks to Make Noise in Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"How does one judge defense without the clear-cut statistics of other sports like baseball and basketball?

I love hitting people,” Hayden said. “Pretty much every time I come out for a cross I hit someone. I almost punched Boxall in the back of the head the other night. Box is the same way. He likes showing everyone where his territory is, and if you come in there with the ball he’ll make you pay.”</p>\n<p>Boxall was raised in Auckland, New Zealand, a country where most kids grow up with a different kind of ball in their hands.</p>\n<p>“I used to play rugby, but I switched to soccer when I was about 10 or 11,” Boxall said. “My high school was a big rugby school, kind of like how football is here. It gets all the attention. I’m glad I switched, it’s taken me to a bunch of places I would have never been able to go and I’m very thankful to be in Santa Barbara right now.”</p>\n<p>“Super” Sam is not exactly a California native either. He was born in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, then moved to Arizona to attend Yavapai College. There, Hayden won two consecutive NJCAA Goalkeeper of the Year awards to go along with the team’s pair of national championships. Not bad for a recruit touted as “too short,” at 5’10.”</p>\n<p>“What I saw was somebody with unbelievable athleticism, who was getting up and over everybody, and who had hands that were incredibly big and strong,” Head Coach Vom Steeg told UCSB Athletics in a story about Hayden’s recruitment process earlier this year. “I told Stu [Dobson, UCSB’s goalkeeper coach], ‘This kid is unbelievable,’ and he goes, ‘How big is he?’ When I said 5’10”, he told me to forget it.”</p>\n<p>Now that the two find themselves united by a common goal in UCSB’s backfield, they’ve become fast friends, joking with each other about their special relationship.</p>\n<p>“We have this joke with one of my friends that Boxall is my number one and she’s my number two,” Hayden said with a laugh. “She doesn’t really like that too much.”</p>\n<p>Despite Boxall’s 200-pound frame and Hayden’s affinity for throwing a punch or two in the box, they both insist the Gaucho defense is about a lot more than just starting fights with opposing teams.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we instigate it,” Boxall says. “With the players that we have like Chris [Hunter], Peter [McGlynn], [Michael] Tetteh and [James] Kiffe, we can basically take whatever they want to throw at us. All of us can handle the physical players, the fast speedy players, but we’re also skilled enough to handle the technically savvy players.”</p>\n<p>Those abilities will be put on the line tonight when Gaucho soccer hosts Denver in the NCAA tournament’s first round. The two teams have not met since 2001, though the Pioneers hosted Gaucho rival Cal Poly in a 1-0 early season loss. The classic sports cliché tells players to take a season one game at a time and never to look beyond an early opponent. But with the College Cup — soccer’s version of the Final Four — being held in Santa Barbara in December, it seems an easy piece of advice to ignore.</p>\n<p>“It’s in the back of our head, of course it is,” Hayden said. “It’s hard for it not to be. But we’re not going to get there if we don’t take care of [Denver]. It’s good motivation for us, but we have to take care of business in the games beforehand.”</p>\n<p>Hayden and Boxall, as leaders of the team, are poised to make a run at a national title. But to beat Denver, or any other team, the Gauchos will need more than just the two of them, and they are the first to say so.</p>\n<p>“Everyone on our squad works their asses off,” Boxall said. “You can tell when we just take over games in the second half. Other teams are just too fatigued. That’s a product of us working hard in the offseason, our coaches running us into the ground, and it seems to be paying its dividends now.”</p>\n<p>At this stage in the season, every team has injuries and every team feels the fatigue. For this pair of seniors playing out their final games in Gaucho blue, overcoming that exhaustion is more than just an objective: It’s a necessity.</p>\n<p>“Our goal, with the players that we have, is to go all the way,” Boxall said. “We’ve known that ever since we got knocked out by UCLA last year. That’s what we’ve been working toward for the last eight, nine months, and it’s definitely going to be a huge disappointment if we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, along with the rest of the squad, never talks about stats, only wins. Don’t expect that to change with a month left of tournament soccer against the nation’s best.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/","id":1701,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1700,1699,1698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Capture Conference Tourney Title Over Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gaucho soccer did something it has never done before on Saturday night: capturing its first-ever Big West Tournament Championship in a 3-1 victory over Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Gaucho soccer did something it has never done before on Saturday night: capturing its first-ever Big West Tournament Championship in a 3-1 victory over Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“We’ve wanted that all season,” senior defender Michael Boxall. “It’s just a stepping stone to the bigger goal, but it’s a great feeling.

That victory handed the Gauchos the luxury of playing at their home field on Saturday, where they outhustled Fullerton for 90 minutes in a match that was never close.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’m very excited for our players tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’ve been 0-2 [in the conference tournament finals], so to finally get that game and enjoy it with our fans — that was great.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck early and often, tallying a pair of first half goals. Junior midfielder Danny Barrera took a ball from sophomore Nic Ryan in the 19th minute, slipping it past Fullerton’s keeper low and left to put UCSB on the board first, 1-0. Just three minutes later, junior midfielder Luis Silva would add the eventual game winner with an unassisted goal off his own deflected corner to put his team up by two, sending the 4,613 spectators in attendance into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take it last year, but unfortunately we didn’t,” Silva said. “We had another chance last night and we did what we had to do. It feels good, but I couldn’t have done it without the team. It’s a group thing; I’m glad we did it together.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s goal, coupled with three shots on goal and four overall, earned him Big West Tournament MVP honors, but Silva’s red-hot foot was all part of a Gaucho trend that has been building all season long. Vom Steeg’s team has outshot its opponent in every match this season, culminating in 15 shots on goal on Saturday which ties a season-high.</p>\n<p>Fullerton, on the other hand, put up just eight shots overall. Its only goal came in the 27th minute, when midfielder Kevin Venegas bent in a cross, which defender Jesse Escalante headed past the outstretched arms of UCSB’s senior goalkeeper Sam Hayden.</p>\n<p>One common theme throughout the match was its physical nature. Eight yellow cards were handed out over the course of the match, with each team receiving four. Outside of the cards, Saturday’s match was full of pushes and shoves on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Fullerton needed to win that game to make it to the tournament,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you’re playing a team and it could be their last game, you’re going to get everything. That’s the way it’s going to be all the way out.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, who stands at 6’2” and weighs 200 pounds, has seen and given his fair share of elbows this season, with last night being no exception.</p>\n<p>“I love it when it gets physical; that’s the way I play,” Boxall said. “I’ve yet to come across someone who can out-physical me. If they like to play that way, it’s playing into our hands and to our strengths.”</p>\n<p>With the win, the Gauchos earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which begins on Nov. 18. Though UCSB would likely have received a spot in the 48-team tournament regardless of Saturday’s result, the win improves the team’s chances for an early-round home game. Gaucho players and coaches will discover their fate today, when the tournament selection takes place on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>These Gauchos are a very different team from the ones who took the field in September, coming out of the gates with a 0-2-2 record before rattling off 13 wins in its last 16 games to close out the season at 13-4-3 overall. Now, their focus shifts forward</p>\n<p>“Like I said from the beginning, I like this group,” Vom Steeg said. “All we know is our name is going to come up [on Monday’s selection show]. That’s all you can really do at this stage, is see who we’re going to play. Hopefully, we’ll get a home game, and we’ll go from there.”</p>\n<p>For a team that is preparing for its ninth-consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, Saturday’s win was little more than a warm-up for the real goal: another national title.</p>\n<p>“[The win over Fullerton] gives us a little boost, but we can’t get too confident, because we don’t know who we’re going play next or their style,” Silva said. “It’s playoffs now and we have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>Monday’s selection show begins at 1:30 p.m. when the team will host a viewing party in the Intercollegiate Athletics Building to find out who will be its first-round opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/","id":1712,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1711,1710,1709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Soccer to Host Denver in NCAA Tournament First Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gaucho soccer received word of its NCAA tournament seeding Monday, when the selection committee announced that the team will face Denver in the first round at Harder Stadium this Thursday, Nov. 18 at ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Gaucho soccer received word of its NCAA tournament seeding Monday, when the selection committee announced that the team will face Denver in the first round at Harder Stadium this Thursday, Nov. 18 at 7 p.m. UCSB earned an automatic bid to the tournament after taking down Cal State Fullerton 3-1 in the Big West Tournament finals.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we’re always excited to play in front of the home crowd,” senior defender Michael Boxall said. “And then the added importance of it being an NCAA tournament game makes it a lot more exciting.

With the Pioneers, Garza scored four goals and was picked as MPSF Newcomer of the Year and was a Second Team All-MPSF selected.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited,” Garza said. “When I first saw it my stomach dropped and I was like, ‘no way,’ but it just had to happen.

The first came in the 19th minute when sophomore midfielder Nic Ryan laid off a ball for junior midfielder Danny Barrera to slip past Titan goalkeeper Trevor Whiddon.
