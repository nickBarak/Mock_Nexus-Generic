It figured to be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as the men had won their past eleven matches, while the women claimed a five-match win streak against the Mustangs. The Gauchos also defeated their rival earlier in the season in their first match with a final score of 171-123 on the women’s side and 161-129 on the men’s side.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thankfully for the Gauchos, their swimmers continued their outstanding trend and came out with the victory against the Mustangs with the scores being 190.5-101.5 for the men and 165-129 for the women. This extends the men’s win streak over the Mustangs to twelve while the women now own a six game win streak against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior freestyle/IM events swimmer Billy Mullis performed outstanding once again for the Gauchos as he went on to win two individual events against the Mustangs. He took first place in the 200 yard freestyle with a time of 1:39.66 and another victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 1:45.75.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior Sprint Freestyle swimmer Cheyenne Low also had a solid performance for the women. She took two individual victories against the Mustangs and won the 100 yard backstroke with a time of 55:63. Low also worked the field and took the victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.99 to give her two first place solo victories on the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mullin and Low are only two swimmers of the many on the talented Gauchos roster that contributed to this fantastic victory. Julia Mikota (23.90) won the 50 yard women freestyle with a time of 23.90 and she also won another event in the 100 yard freestyle with a time of 51.86. Another large contributor to this victory for the Gauchos was their relay teams. At the beginning of the meet, the men’s “A”  relay took first in the 200 yard medley relay with a time of 1:30.26, while the women’s “A” relay also took first in the same event with a time of 1:43.74. Towards the end of the match, the women’s A relay again stole a victory with a time of 3:30.10, and their “B” relay was right behind them with a second place time of 3:33.27.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This victory gives the Gauchos swim teams two excellent records to finish the season, with the men ending with a 5-2 record and the women finishing with a 5-1 record, respectively. This win only added to the amazing regular seasons that the two Gaucho swim teams had, and to demoralize their rivals in the final regular season game truly seems to be the cherry on top.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, this was a big win for the Gauchos and gives them tremendous momentum going into the at MPSF Championship, which will be taking place in February. This regular season was also a large stepping stone for what could be in store in the postseason. The Gaucho swim teams seem to have the recipe for success, and it seems as if they could definitely make a deep run the way they’re tearing up the pool as of late. It should be fun to watch, as the mixture of youth, experience, talent, and dedication is all coming together for the Gauchos at the perfect time of the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rest of the Gaucho swim season starts with the MPSF Championship, which will take place in East Los Angeles, California.

Dating back to the 2011-12 season, the Gauchos have notoriously been outstanding when they have matched up against the Cal Poly swim teams.</p>\n<p>The men’s team has won nine straight matches against the Mustangs, and this includes the win earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the women have almost been equally as dominant, winning their last five matches against the Mustangs dating back to the 2013-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB should feel confident, but not cocky. This is a prime opportunity to continue the hot streak and continue their success against a rival opponent. They should have no problem against the Mustangs as they are in a down year; however, this is easier said than done, and it should be a matchup to watch.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Jan. 28 at 11 a.m. in beautiful San Luis Obispo, Calif.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75231\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75231\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/thriving-gauchos-travel-to-cal-poly/","id":1791,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1790,1789,1788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Run The Table in Vegas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2017-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was an eventful weekend for both the UCSB men's and women's swim teams as the men continued their winning streak, while the women got back on the winning track.

Another stupendous contributor for the Gauchos was freshman Heaven Quintana, who was blazing fast, and put up times many swimmers would be envious of. She put up times of 29.05 in the 50 yard breaststroke, 1:02.17 in the 100 yard breaststroke, and 2:18.85 in the 200 yard breaststroke.</p>\n<p>The whole team thrived off of the energy of these young swimmers, and the team ultimately wound up with a first place team victory that was no doubt a collective team effort.</p>\n<p>Headlining the competition with two victories, the Gaucho men’s team handled the competition. They were able to capture a win over UNLV, and they seemed to do it with ease with a lopsided score of 173 to 120.</p>\n<p>Against the Air Force Academy, this match proved to be much more difficult. With the Gauchos staring adversity in the face, down 32 points, they somehow, someway willed themselves back for a comeback that many did not see coming.</p>\n<p>The men were able to use grit and determination, backed by some clutch performances, to narrowly snatch the win right out from under  the Air Force Academy’s nose. This gutsy performance led to a final victory with a score of 148-146, with the Gauchos finding satisfaction in ruining perfection with the Air Force suffering its first loss and snapping the Academy’s undefeated season.</p>\n<p>This was only half of the competition, and while the men were enjoying this outstanding weekend, the women weren’t too shabby themselves. They were able to showcase their youth and athleticism with many young Gauchos showing that they are going to be a force to be reckoned with going forward.</p>\n<p>The women were able to seal the deal with a final score of 159.5-126.5, and were able to truly bounce back after a week against Pacific in which they suffered their first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>The men and women are hoping to use these victories to fuel them in what is definitely going to be a tough week in front of them. The Gauchos take on longtime fierce rival Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo this Saturday, Jan. 28th at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/gauchos-run-the-table-in-vegas/","id":1787,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1786,1785,1784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Win Big in Vegas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men’s and women’s swim teams are seeking to improve on a solid year so far for the Gauchos.

The men look to take this win and let it propel them to back-to-back victories this upcoming weekend, while the women look to shake the loss off and bounce back stronger than ever.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, the UNLV men’s swim team record stands at 0-3 not counting invitationals, while the women have a slightly better record at 1-3.

just a fraction of a second ahead of the second place swimmer.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos dominated the men’s 500-yard free by claiming first- through fourth-place finishes; spearheaded by Lastelic first place time of 4:31.08.</p>\n<p>Yoessef Tibazi, the senior swimmer, claimed first in the men’s 100-yard fly with half a second lead at 48.35.</p>\n<p>First place in the men’s 400-yard individual medley was won by senior Dylan Kubick with an impressive time of 3:57.25. The Gauchos men’s would go on to close out the meet with first place in the 200-yard free relay, thanks to the A relay team of Mullis, Tibazi, sophomore Mason Tittle and freshman Riley Ferguson. They clocked in at 1:22.33, just a twentieth of a second faster than the Tigers’ second place finish.</p>\n<p>To recap, the UCSB men’s bested Pacific on nine of 15 total events, while the UCSB women’s placed first in only six. The women’s side lost the score lead due to their late decline, whereas the men’s was victorious due to their late consistency. This shaped the Gauchos overall success. It was a great day for a swim meet.</p>\n<p>Swim season will continue next week on Friday when UCSB travels away to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they will face off against UNLV in an exhibition meet at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/gaucho-mens-comeback-over-tigers-womens-fall-late-in-the-meet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/gaucho-mens-comeback-over-tigers-womens-fall-late-in-the-meet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/gaucho-mens-comeback-over-tigers-womens-fall-late-in-the-meet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/gaucho-mens-comeback-over-tigers-womens-fall-late-in-the-meet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-17/gaucho-mens-comeback-over-tigers-womens-fall-late-in-the-meet/","id":1784,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1783,1782,1781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Prepares For Texas Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016.10.29_StephenManga_Swim-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016.10.29_StephenManga_Swim-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB swim will look to carry its momentum into the Texas Invitational after last week's performances in which the men's team finished in first place at the A3 Invitational, while the women came in thi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Swim will be competing at the annual Texas Invitational this week.

Specifically speaking, this was accomplished from a few certain swimmers.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, former Gaucho Wade Allen broke the school record in the men’s 100 freestyle with a time of 0:43.26. Another UCSB swim alum, Andrea Ward, broke the women’s 200 butterfly record, a record which she previously owned herself, by a three-second difference of 1:56.11. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent graduate Katie Records also achieved three separate NCAA “B” standard times as a sophomore, with a 1:56.79 in the 200 butterfly, 2:13.64 in her preliminaries and a 2:13.52 in the finals. In 2014, while swimming her preliminaries, Records’ time of 2:01.34 earned her an NCAA “B” standard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing third that year in her championship heat, Ward’s time of 1:57.18 in the women’s 200 butterfly also earned NCAA consideration. For the men’s, former Gaucho Mickey Mowry took seventh overall in the 200 butterfly championship final with a time of 1:45.30, acquiring himself an NCAA nod as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the Texas Invitational has housed many of the Gauchos’ feats in swim. More broken records and NCAA time considerations will hopefully follow in this year’s competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Texas Invitational is an annually held tournament where only the best universities and their swimming programs compete. Over the years, it has transitioned back and forth from a Hall of Fame tournament to hosting for USA Swimming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previous A3 Performance Invitational opponent UCLA will also be present in Austin, Texas after placing first overall in the tournament last week. The point separation between the Bruins and Gauchos wasn’t too far off, so UCSB will look to close that competitive gap this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas Invitational rulings state that each school may only send a select amount of swimmers to represent them. Therefore, overall scoring will depend on individual results and placement times regarding each race type.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alumni had previously been present to race for UCSB. Now more recently the Swim program has centered its team on only active NCAA level members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name list of UCSB’s competitors has yet to be published. Confirmation should arrive within the next few days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Texas Invitational begins this Thursday, Dec. 1 and will conclude on Saturday Dec. 3. The invitational is scheduled to take place all day as tournament preliminaries will usually be held during the day, whilst finals are in the night.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74524\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ucsb-prepares-for-texas-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74524\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ucsb-prepares-for-texas-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ucsb-prepares-for-texas-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ucsb-prepares-for-texas-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ucsb-prepares-for-texas-invitational/","id":1779,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1778,1777,1776],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Men’s Swimming Finish 1st at A3 Invite, Women’s Clinch 3rd","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For another consecutive year, UC Santa Barbara impressed in the overall rankings at the A3 invite.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Competition was fierce these past few days at East Los Angeles College’s swim facility where, for the fourth year straight, the A3 Performance Invitational was held.

Races commenced with 9 a.m. preliminaries and ended with daily 5 p.m. finals.</p>\n<p>UCSB tournament highlights included a win for the men in the 200 yard free relay in which junior Billy Mullis, sophomore Mason Tittle, freshman Riley Ferguson and senior Yoessef Tibazi put up a 1:19.71 finals time. This team would also go on to repeat a win of 3:12.99 in the 400 yard medley relay, in which Ferguson was replaced by senior Andy Castilleja.</p>\n<p>This was followed by sophomore Logan Hotchkiss’s first-place time of 4:19.84 in the men’s 500 yard free finals.</p>\n<p>The men’s side would continue their domination of freestyle competitions by also placing first, second, third and seventh in the 50 yard free.</p>\n<p>The men’s A relay team posted yet another victory with a finals time of 1:28.35 in the 200 yard medley relay with Castilleja being substituted for junior Jonathan Panchak.</p>\n<p>The women’s squad would receive their first win in a nail biter, with freshman Heaven Quintana’s 53.70 finals time in the women’s 100 Yard Fly. Second, third, fourth and fifth came up just short, within fractions of a second of each other.</p>\n<p>Billy Mullis provided another win with a finals time of 47.25 in the men’s 100-yard fly.</p>\n<p>Quintana Heaven once again beat the competition by a time of 1:01.11 in the women’s 100-yard breast. She bested second, third and fourth for yet another close call.</p>\n<p>Castilleja ensured a win in the men’s 100-yard breast with a finals time of 54.38, barely beating his teammate Panchak, who secured second place with a time of 54.95. The duo would then swap positioning in the 200-yard breast in which Panchak’s time of 1:59.43 just held off Castilleja’s 1:59.45</p>\n<p>Mullis, Hotchkiss, freshman Joe Lastelic and senior Dylan Kubick would go on to claim another relay win. Their performance of 6:32.56, in the men’s 800 yard free, finalized their authority in the relay section.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Michael Wang joined the A relay team of Mullis, Tibazi, and Tittle, for the men’s 400 yard free, which wrapped up Santa Barbara’s remarkable tournament with a first place time of 2:57.65.</p>\n<p>Altogether, Gauchos men’s swim put up a whopping 2028 points, in the scoring for overall Team Rankings through event 304, ensuring them a first-place tournament win and their second A3 Performance Invitational victory.</p>\n<p>The women’s came up short of UCLA’s first-place finish by 451.5 points in overall scoring. Third place may have been less than what they had hoped for, but a top three finish out of an 11-team pool is a positive regardless.</p>\n<p>Both the men’s and women’s teams will look to keep up their current forms as the season progresses into its midway stages.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume their swim season on Dec. 1 in Austin, Texas for the Texas Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-mens-swimming-finish-1st-at-a3-invite-womens-clinch-3rd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-mens-swimming-finish-1st-at-a3-invite-womens-clinch-3rd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-mens-swimming-finish-1st-at-a3-invite-womens-clinch-3rd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-mens-swimming-finish-1st-at-a3-invite-womens-clinch-3rd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-mens-swimming-finish-1st-at-a3-invite-womens-clinch-3rd/","id":1782,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1781,1780,1779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swim Prepares for A3 Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The men and women's gaucho swim teams are back to action this week in the annual A-3 Invitational.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74227\" style=\"width: 502px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74227\" data-attachment-id=\"74227\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/11-05-swim-ucsd-ericswensonnexus-8-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"11-05-swim-ucsd-ericswensonnexus-8-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74227\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-8-web-1024x684.jpg?resize=492%2C329\" alt=\"Melissa Mullis jumps off the block for the backstroke event.

All events will be held at the East Los Angeles College swim facility.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 17, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-swim-prepares-for-a3-invite/","id":1778,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1777,1776,1775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Women’s Swim Dominate Tritons, Men’s Fall Short Despite Early Lead","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11-05-Swim-UCSD-EricSwensonNexus-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was a busy Saturday morning at Campus Pool where the UCSB swim team hosted the UC San Diego swim team in a non-conference duel match.

Then San Diego settled with more victory splits, favoring their men’s side, in both the 200-yard back and breaststroke.</p>\n<p>Back and forth lead changes began to occur once the San Diego women’s clinched their first first place win of the meet in race No. 21 for the 500-yard freestyle. The Tritons women’s would go on to acquire first place finishes for the rest of their matchups.</p>\n<p>San Diego Swim went on to take both the 100-yard fly and 400-yard IM, but their men’s side dropped the 500-yard freestyle to Santa Barbara freshman Logan Hotchkiss (4:35.29).</p>\n<p>The meet concluded with two final relays, the 200-yard freestyle. For the women’s side the Triton “A” (1:35.79) and “B” (1:40.08) took first and second place.

A total of three Gauchos placed first through third in the event.</p>\n<p>Clocking in at first place was Low. A runner-up in the 100 backstroke at the MPSF Championships last season, Low outswam the rest of the competition for the victory with a time of 55.11.</p>\n<p>Not too far behind was Stevens with a finals time of 56.90. Placing in third was freshman Tara Middleton, finishing her backstroke at a time of 58.38.</p>\n<p>Earning Cal Poly another first-place finish was the individual victory of freshman Hailey Houck in the women’s 200-yard fly with a time of 2:03:63.</p>\n<p>Although both the men and women had a clear path to victory, UCSB’s absence of a diving program served as free points for the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>However, helping pave the way for UCSB’s women’s team were the individual efforts of Low, Mikota and Quintana as they finished with two individual wins each.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos captured their last two first-place finishes in the women’s 200-yard IM and the women’s 400-yard free relay.</p>\n<p>Tallying the best time with a final result of 2:06:40 was junior Alyssa Shew in the 200-yard IM. Almost claiming first place behind her was Quintana with a finishing time of 2:06:68.</p>\n<p>Winning ahead of Cal Poly’s relay team by almost more than six seconds, UCSB’s “A” squad of Low, Mikota, sophomore Lilly Helmuth-Malone and freshman Catherine Boles registered their first-place finish with a time of 3:26:78.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s “A” group came in second place with a final time of 3:32:48. In spite of its men’s 400-yard relay team claiming first in Saturday’s final event, clocking in at 3:07:84, the Mustangs slow start to begin the match set them too far behind to match UCSB’s pace throughout the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain at Campus Pool for its second dual meet match of the season. The Gauchos will host UC San Diego this Satuday, Nov. 5 with the first event set to begin at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gaucho-swim-sweeps-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gaucho-swim-sweeps-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gaucho-swim-sweeps-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gaucho-swim-sweeps-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/gaucho-swim-sweeps-mustangs/","id":1777,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1776,1775,1774],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Aquatic Legend Gregg Wilson Retires After 40 Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?resize=733%2C544&ssl=1","description":"After a much decorated 40-year career as the UCSB swim coach, Gregg Wilson will have his retirement party this Saturday to ride off into the sunset.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72913\" style=\"width: 743px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72913\" data-attachment-id=\"72913\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/retirement-celebration-for-ucsbs-aquatic-legend-gregg-wilson-this-saturday/greggwarchive1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?fit=733%2C544&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"733,544\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"greggwarchive1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?fit=733%2C544&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72913 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?resize=733%2C544\" alt=\"greggwarchive1\" width=\"733\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?w=733&amp;ssl=1 733w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GreggWArchive1.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72913\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB’s head coach of the swim team, Gregg Wilson, stands with his 1979 team.

In the 1983-84 season, however, Wilson simply needed a break from his coaching duties of 80-hour work weeks and returned to his alma mater Cal and became the program’s aquatic director.</p>\n<p>Despite returning to his former university, there was a void within Wilson, and his love for the game eventually drew him back to UCSB. However, his return to the pool deck would eventually change with an increase in duties.</p>\n<p>“What I realized was I missed the stimulation of the student-athlete, the challenges that presented themselves here [at UCSB],” Wilson said. “They decided during my absence to merge the men’s and women’s teams. They invited me back [as the] aquatic director [and] head coach and that started the programs together. It exceeded my expectations; I had to learn a lot. I went down to working 60-70 hours a week and everything really took off. It was an experiment for the department. It worked so well that they merged the men’s and women’s track programs and that was right at the beginning of a lot of programs across the country merging men and women together.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72857\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72857\" data-attachment-id=\"72857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/retirement-celebration-for-ucsbs-aquatic-legend-gregg-wilson-this-saturday/gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=226%2C339\" alt=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" width=\"226\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gregg Wilson was UCSB’s head swim coach for the past 40 years. He saw two of his athletes win Olympic gold medals. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The merge of both the men’s and women’s programs marked Wilson’s return to UCSB for the 1985-86 season. From that point on, he became the pioneer of a new and improved culture at UCSB that fostered a generational growth for the next 40 years.</p>\n<p>A mastermind of the complexities within swim, the veteran coach accumulated a myriad of accolades that comfortably rank atop the Gaucho record book.</p>\n<p>Wilson retired with a total of 36 Big West titles and was appreciated for his prominence within the conference, winning 27 Big West Coach of the Year awards in addition to earning two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Coach of the Year honors.</p>\n<p>Defined by longevity, it is surprising that he initially was signed on a short-term contract for five years, but the terms were eventually eliminated.</p>\n<p>The extension of Wilson’s time at UCSB may serve as one of the program’s most beneficial decisions, as his guidance helped enhance the skills of various talented swimmers. Throughout Wilson’s tenure, approximately 72 swimmers were rewarded with All-American status. Most notably, his prevalence in national competition ascended as well, as he coached three Olympians, including former Gauchos and Team USA gold medalists Richard Schroeder and Jason Lezak.</p>\n<p>Although the extensive list of milestones were well-deserved achievements, Wilson’s never allowed his reputable coaching status to outshine the true importance of maintaining a commitment to his student-athletes.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a lot of scholarship money, so I set the goal of [seeing] what I could do with raw material,” Wilson explained. “[My mindset was] come here for very little or nothing and let’s see what we can do. Probably the best example of that are the two gold medal winners that we have.”</p>\n<p>Schroeder walked on to the UCSB swim program out of the junior college ranks and worked his way into representing the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics, excelling and earning gold. Following Schroeder nearly two decades later was Lezak, who Wilson explained was a good swimmer coming out of high school but reached his pinnacle at the collegiate level, becoming an All-American and eventual gold medalist as well.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that UCSB may not have ever been considered an elite swimming program, Wilson’s commitment to teaching student-athletes the true craft of swim fueled his long-term stay in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, those student-athletes appreciated this passion, as his lasting impression remains evident.</p>\n<p>“He represented a great legacy for 40 years,” senior Meghan Bicomong said. “Gregg’s really personal with the Gaucho family. Everyone is connected together [which helped] build team comradery and that really hits home for me because he’s super personal and that’s what kind of helped me to get into this school and helped me decide on going here.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, Wilson possessed a competitive edge when coaching, but it was his hospitable nature that provided a sense of balance that attracted the likes of so many players.</p>\n<p>“I played water polo for the most of my life so I didn’t think I was going to be much of a swimmer,” senior Matt Drum explained. “My high school season ended, then I got this call from Gregg and he’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to come swim at UC Santa Barbara?’ I didn’t do so well my last year [of high school] but Gregg somehow still believed in me to come here, so I owe him a lot for that.”</p>\n<p>Well-deserving of his recognition for the mark he has left on the UCSB campus and swimming program, Wilson’s efforts expand to the Santa Barbara community as a whole with the establishment of Wilson Swimming. The community swimming program offers swimming camps and lessons here at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>While Wilson’s impact will remain unmatched, UCSB has shown great appreciation for the former coach with the creation of the Gregg and Carol Wilson Swimming Enhancement Fund.

USC was a Pac-12 champion a year ago,” said Macedo. “Having some men out of the meet [Saturday] was disappointing and difficult for us. Swimming that meet against that caliber of competition with 11 guys: It was challenging, but I’m proud of the way they swam.”</p>\n<p>Missing from UCSB’s intended 12-man lineup for the day was junior transfer from University of Indiana and IM/breaststroke swimmer Jonathan Panchak, who suffered a neck injury.</p>\n<p>Of the 14 events that took place on Saturday, 11 of which were individual races, UCSB managed to finish in first place twice.</p>\n<p>Emerging for the Gauchos’ first victory of the meet was senior Yoessef Tibazi with a time of 48.88 seconds in the 100-yard butterfly. USC senior Michael Domagala narrowly trailed him with a clock-in time of 49.35 seconds.</p>\n<p>Following right after Tibazi with a win in the 100-yard IM was sophomore backstroke/IM swimmer Douglas Nogueira. He collected the first-place finish in 52.41 seconds, just ahead of two fellow Gauchos, Tibazi and sophomore butterfly/IM swimmer Javier Lopez. Tibazi placed second with a time of 53.70 seconds while Lopez was registered at 54.33 seconds.</p>\n<p>Certainly the victories of Tibazi and Nogueira elicited a sigh of relief from the Gauchos, but it was evident the team’s lack of players — due to suspension and the women’s team not having a scheduled meet — took its toll on the players who competed Saturday.</p>\n<p>“They [didn’t] have the women to separate and give them more time in between races,” said Macedo. “Some of those boys had to go from one event directly into another and that’s a really hard way to go into that meet. We’ve got some work to do; we looked a little sloppy in some areas, but at the same time we know what we need to improve.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough, USC took advantage of the Gauchos’ shortcomings and ended Saturday’s meet with a total of nine first-place swimmers.</p>\n<p>Leading the Trojans with two first-place wins was junior Dylan Carter. He established his presence early in the third event of the meet, winning in the 200-yard freestyle at 1:37.90. Finishing with a time nearly four seconds quicker than the second-place finisher, Carter’s imprint on the meet surfaced early.</p>\n<p>But the competition became more intense as the Trojans’ top swimmer participated in the 100-yard freestyle, which also included the Gauchos’ prominent Tibazi. Carter prevailed and continued his dominance with victory at a time of 45.47 while Tibazi swam closely behind at 46.09 seconds.</p>\n<p>Surely the Gauchos’ lack of depth should be of consideration when analyzing the results of Saturday’s meet, but much work is to be done if they plan on helping their first-year coach obtain immediate success.</p>\n<p>Although Macedo is in his first season as head coach at UCSB, it is his third year with the program. While he’s still working to figure things out inside the pool, Macedo doesn’t have to change his vision too much, as most of the pieces he’s been working with since day one are still in place.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is continue a very strong culture of hard work and academic success,” said Macedo. “I want to put my own twist on that; we’ve got a new staff this year [and] Gregg is still around volunteering, [which] is a real resource of mine to have him to bounce ideas off of and [see how did he] handle this in the past.”</p>\n<p>Next for both the UCSB men’s and women’s teams is the program’s annual Intrasquad and Alumni games. The pair of exhibition matchups with take place on Saturday, Oct. 8 with the Intrasquad game starting the morning off at 9 a.m., followed by the Alumni match at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p>Both games will be hosted at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72802\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72802\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/","id":1776,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1775,1774,1773],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/sports/swim-and-dive","highestPage":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
