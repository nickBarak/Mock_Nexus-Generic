Most of their success is attributed to the best big man on the planet: Dwight Howard. “Superman” is dominating the NBA in a way that has not been seen in decades, and he is on his way to becoming the first player to average 20 points and 15 rebounds per game since Moses Malone accomplished the feat in 1979.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Howard has adamantly expressed his desire to be traded to another team, where he can move to a larger media market and compete for an NBA title. While the Magic have shown they can win this season, Howard continues to put pressure on General Manager Otis Smith to find a trade partner or risk losing the center to free agency with nothing to show for him. Smith would be smart to find the best deal possible and trade Howard while he still can.</p>\n<p>With the trade deadline still two months away, expect to see the Howard trade mania explode come March, similar to Carmelo Anthony’s last season. Some of the likely trade partners include the Nets, Mavericks, Knicks, Clippers and Lakers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Initially considered a favorite in landing Howard, New Jersey’s attempts have been strained with center Brook Lopez’s broken foot. New York presents an interesting option for the Magic with pieces like Tyson Chandler and Amare Stoudemire, but it seems too quick to give up on the current Knicks roster. While the remaining teams all have adequate pieces to acquire Howard, look for the Lakers as the most rumored trade partner until proven otherwise.</p>\n<p>In young center Andrew Bynum, the Lakers possess the strongest trade chip of any team on the market, unless Los Angeles’ other team pulls a bonehead Clipper move and trades their future star Blake Griffin. With a package of Bynum and two or three first-round picks to go along with a young guard, the Lakers present the biggest and likeliest threat to nab Howard, and would rejuvenate an aging roster in the process.</p>\n<p>A team-up of Howard, Pau Gasol and Kobe would rival Miami’s Big Three and ensure the Lakers a competitive spot in the NBA title race for years to come. Howard’s recent performances only add to eager NBA fans’ yearning for their own teams to pull the trigger and bring in the most dominant center in the league.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>staff writer Paul-Michael is having a hard time containing his excitement about a possible threesome with Kobe, Dwight, and Pau.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-24/tuesday-ballin-nexus-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-24/tuesday-ballin-nexus-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-24/tuesday-ballin-nexus-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-24/tuesday-ballin-nexus-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-24/tuesday-ballin-nexus-sports/","id":798,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[797,796,795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins 2OT Thriller at CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It takes big plays to win a double overtime game.

Northridge was forced to foul and Johnson, a 94 percent free throw shooter, drained them both to give her team a 50-47 lead.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the game, there’s no better player to have on the line,” Mitchell said. “Free throws are very mental and she showed her mental toughness.”</p>\n<p>Then, Matador freshman forward Jessica Duarte came to the rescue for her team, hitting a three with just seconds remaining to send the game to overtime.</p>\n<p>“I saw [the shot] go in the air and I just was like, ‘please don’t go in, please don’t go in,’” Adrian, whose 17 points tied her career high, said. “[The shot] bounced around on the rim for a bit and went through. From there we had to regroup and focus on overtime.”</p>\n<p>In overtime and in need of points, it was Adrian who knocked down a critical three-pointer for UCSB, tying the game at 58 apiece.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos once again found themselves playing defense in the final possession. With the score tied, Johnson took a charge, sending the game to double overtime.</p>\n<p>Adrian got UCSB on the board first in 2OT. Up 65-64 with the period almost over, she came up with a crucial steal on the defensive end. The Matadors’ coach thought she stepped on the end line and was called for a technical.</p>\n<p>The foul call led to two made free throws by Johnson, who also converted on another four freebies to clinch the game. She shot 8-8 from the line overall.</p>\n<p>As they usually do in close games, free throws played a vital role. Over the course of the game, Northridge spent a lot of time at the charity stripe, shooting 27-38, but couldn’t hit them when it mattered most.</p>\n<p>Yet free throws kept Northridge in the game. UCSB held the Matadors to 31 percent shooting. Meanwhile, UCSB shot a solid 42.6 percent from the field, a much stronger performance than in its horrible loss to Long Beach State Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We were attacking,” Adrian said. “We were back on our heels against Long Beach, but with Northridge, we really took it to them.”</p>\n<p>After a 10-0 run late in the first half, the Gauchos entered the second half with a 28-24 lead. After halftime, UCSB’s lead grew to 11, but Northridge battled back, creating the dramatic finish.</p>\n<p>“They really started attacking and we’re getting to the rim,” Adrian said. “They were drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line. That got them back in the game.”</p>\n<p>Northridge freshman guard Janae Sharpe led all scorers with 19 points, 11 of which came from the charity stripe. For UCSB, sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit also contributed 11 points.</p>\n<p>“That’s [Sharpe’s] MO — to get to the rim and draw fouls,” Mitchell said. “We can learn from her because it doesn’t matter how you score. It’s about getting the two points.”</p>\n<p>This week, UC Santa Barbara women’s basketball returns home, facing UC Davis</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43764\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/ucsb-wins-2ot-thriller-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43764\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/ucsb-wins-2ot-thriller-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/ucsb-wins-2ot-thriller-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/ucsb-wins-2ot-thriller-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/ucsb-wins-2ot-thriller-csun/","id":797,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[796,795,794],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer Lopsided Loss Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"National television cameras scanned the Thunderdome crowd on Saturday night as a sold-out crowd of 6,000 fans awaited tip-off between the top two teams in the Big West.

But once the game began, UCSB struggled offensively as Long Beach State used a 23-2 run to cruise to a 71-48 victory.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t stay as resilient as you have to when you are playing a team of Long Beach’s athletic ability,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I thought we were a little fragile out there. We didn’t stay fighting.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers (14-6 overall, 7-0 Big West) cruised past UCSB (9-7, 4-2) and its 2-3 zone defense, shooting a blistering 58.7 percent from the field to remain in sole possession of first place in the conference. The Gauchos are currently tied for second place with UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“They shot the hell out of [the ball],” senior forward Jaimé Serna said. “We started off well and we were right there with them, and it just didn’t happen for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 35.1 percent as a team and scored a season-low 48 points, as senior captains and leading scorers Orlando Johnson and James Nunnally suffered through off nights, shooting a combined 5-for-22 from the field. Johnson finished with 10 points and Nunnally had a season-low five points. Freshman Alan “Big Al” Williams and senior center Greg Somogyi each scored a team-high 10 points for the Gauchos. Santa Barbara’s previous low was 50 points in a loss at Berkeley last month.</p>\n<p>“Quite frankly we have to knock down shots and we have to take better care of the ball,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Four out of five Long Beach starters scored in double figures, led by senior guard Larry Anderson with 19 points. Senior guard Casper Ware poured in 14 points and a game-high five assists, and senior forward T.J. Robinson, the leading rebounder in the Big West, posted a double-double with 11 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>With 07:34 to play in the first half, sophomore guard Kyle Boswell hit a three-pointer to give the Gauchos a 21-18 lead — the last lead they would have in the game. Long Beach went 7-for-8 from the floor and ran off an 18-2 run to head into the halftime up 36-23.</p>\n<p>“You just can’t let Long Beach get in transition,” Williams said of the Big West leading 49er offense.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker room, it was more of the same struggles for the Gauchos. A layup from Ware and a three-pointer from Anderson crushed any hopes for a Gaucho run out of the locker room, as the 49ers continued their devastating run, extending their lead to 41-23 with 19 minutes left. UCSB was able to cut the deficit to 43-27 on a baseline dunk by Johnson with just under 18 minutes to play, but never got closer than that. Long Beach reached its biggest lead of the night at 65-34 on a layup from Anderson, before eventually winning 71-48.</p>\n<p>“We just have to flush [this game] out,” Serna said. “What’s tough is that we want to play our best in front of a sell-out crowd, and then to come out and get blown out … You win some, you lose some.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hit the road for four straight games, as the Gauchos play seven of their next eight away from the Thunderdome. UCSB will play at UC Davis and Pacific this weekend, and will return home next on Feb. 11 when it hosts UC Riverside in a game televised on PrimeTicket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/","id":800,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[799,798,797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Long Beach, Host Northridge on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Offensive shooting woes plagued the UCSB women’s basketball team Thursday night in an ugly 46-34 loss to Long Beach State.

After quickly going down 5-0, Mitchell yanked all five starters.</p>\n<p>“Starting is a responsibility,” Mitchell said. “It’s their responsibility to set the tone and I didn’t feel like they did that. Everything we did was a second delayed.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit provided the needed spark off the bench to score the Gauchos’ first four points of the game. Nesbit, who may have provided the only positive on the evening, totaled 11 points.</p>\n<p>“Nicole has been pretty consistent the entire year,” Mitchell said. “If there was one shining point tonight, it was that Nicole gave us some consistency.”</p>\n<p>Lucky for UCSB, the 49ers also had a slow start, keeping the Gauchos in the game.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos closed the gap to 13-12, senior forward Tipesa Moorer hit a jumper to start a 11-2 Long Beach run to end the first half.</p>\n<p>In fact, Moorer seemed to find an answer every time UCSB even thought about finding some offensive momentum. She finished with 14 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“Moorer had a great first half,” Nesbit said. “She seemed to be in the zone. She was hitting her shots and getting everything she wanted.”</p>\n<p>After halftime, everything continued to go wrong for the Gauchos. At the 14 minute mark, the 49ers doubled up on UCSB 32-16 and about a minute later, LBSU saw their biggest lead of the game at 19 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s like it’s contagious,” Mitchell said, who compared her team’s offensive cold streak to a disease. “That basket gets really small, but it’s inexcusable. It’s unfortunate tonight that that disease hit, like, five players.”</p>\n<p>UCSB narrowly avoided going into the record books as one of the program’s lowest scoring games. Back in the 1970’s, UC Santa Barbara twice scored 32 points.</p>\n<p>“The open shots were there,” Mitchell said. The right people were taking the shots. Unfortunately they just didn’t fall.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, while the Gauchos only tallied five assists and shot 27.8 percent from the field (compared to Long Beach’s 36.7 percent), UCSB was getting good shots, which eventually will land.</p>\n<p>“We have to put this game behind us,” Nesbit said. “Two-game road trips are always hard, but we just have to move on because we can’t let this loss affect our next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound this Saturday at Cal State Northridge. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/","id":795,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[794,793,792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Long Beach on National Stage","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This is what it’s all about.

The 49ers are coming off a 78-69 win on the road at Cal Poly on Thursday night. A team that thrives on a fast-paced dynamic offense, Long Beach State leads the Big West in scoring offense (74.4 points per game), scoring margin of victory (14 per game), and field goal percentage (47.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“You have to slow them down, they are by far the best transition offensive team,” Williams said of the 49ers. “They get out and fly offensively. We will have to contain [Casper] Ware — he is a one man wrecking crew — and keep them off the boards.”</p>\n<p>Ware, the senior Long Beach point guard who joined the Gauchos’ Johnson on the Wooden Award Preseason Top-50 list, ranks third in the Big West with 16.4 points per game. Long Beach senior forward T.J. Robinson and senior guard Larry Anderson rank 10th and 8th in the conference in scoring, with 14.7 and 12.6 points per game, respectively. Robinson leads the conference in rebounds with 10.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a really good team, there is no doubt about it,” Williams said. “They get pretty fired up to play us. The taste of what happened in the Big West championships against us is something that they carry in their mouth. … We are going to have to fight that fire and beat their intensity.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers gained national notoriety for its amazingly tough nonconference schedule. At one time, Long Beach’s RPI (Rating Percentage Index, a measure of strength of schedule) was No. 1 in the country, after the veteran squad beat then No. 9 Pittsburgh and No. 14 Xavier, and played other nationally ranked squads to close decisions.</p>\n<p>“They play the toughest schedule they can get,” Williams said. “[Long Beach Head Coach Dan Monson] feels it makes his team battle tested, and is a great way to prepare them for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>The matchup at Long Beach may be even more important, given the Gauchos upcoming schedule. After facing the 49ers tomorrow night, UCSB plays seven of its next eight games on the road, including four straight away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“Those seven of eight games on the road is a daunting task,” Williams said. “We just have to focus and take care of business at home first.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to capitalize on its home court advantage against Long Beach. The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, having only narrowly lost to No. 16 San Diego State in overtime and No. 14 UNLV in double overtime. With national television cameras in the Thunderdome, a crowded and rowdy student section is expected.</p>\n<p>“Some of the best crowds we have ever had have been at home this year,” Williams said. “It really pushes us on.”</p>\n<p>In the win over Northridge, both teams played zone defense the entire game, with the Matadors applying full-court pressure. Although CSUN leads the conference in steals per game, UCSB came out on top in all of the “hustle” categories, recording more rebounds, blocks and steals.</p>\n<p>Despite taking seven fewer shots than CSUN in the first half, UCSB entered the locker room with a 31-22 advantage. The Gauchos came out slow at the onset of the second half, and turnovers allowed the Matadors to run off an 11-0 run to take a 33-31 lead with 17 minutes remaining, Northridge’s first lead of the game. At that point, coach Williams had seen enough, and decided to sub in a fresh five off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I think that was the first time this year that I have [subbed in] five new,” Williams said. “There was just an energy on the floor that had to change. The great thing is that nobody hung their head, and they all played better when they went back in.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rallied and — behind a 13-0 run of their own — was able to stretch its lead to 57-40 with 6:30 to play. Unable to close out the Matadors UCSB once again let up on the gas, allowing CSUN to hang around. The Matadors got as close as seven with just over a minute left to play, but the Gauchos were able to close it out 69-61.</p>\n<p>Johnson, who was recently named to the Midseason Top 25 for the Wooden award, led UCSB with a game-high 21 points, and senior guard James Nunnally added 16. Sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle tallied seven points to go with a game-high five steals, and senior center Greg Somogyi recorded a game-high 10 rebounds and added two blocks.</p>\n<p>“Coach talks about being a spark off the bench, and I tried to do that for us tonight,” Somogyi said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday’s game against Long Beach is set for 8 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/","id":792,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[791,790,789],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Take on CSULB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After an easy victory against UC Riverside last weekend, the UCSB women’s basketball team will see tougher competition when it hits the road to face Long Beach State tonight.

We’re going to see some zones, so we’re going to have to execute a little quicker.”</p>\n<p>Like UCSB, the 49ers feature a balanced attack on offense. Three players average 9.3 points or higher. Senior forward Tipesa Moorer leads the attack with 12.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[Moorer’s] a little undersized but she’s been putting up big numbers,” Mitchell said. “She’s a mismatch problem because they’re basically playing four guards and that can sometimes get us in trouble because Tilleman’s more comfortable playing post defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also have to keep an eye on freshman guard Alex Sanchez. Averaging 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds, Sanchez is a very versatile player who can play many positions.</p>\n<p>“They’re all very athletic and quick,” sophomore guard Melissa Zornig said. “I think as long as we play our defense and execute on the offensive end we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday against UCR, UC Santa Barbara found their offensive stride. Offensive execution has been a weakness for the Gauchos, so the team hopes the offensive fluidity will carry with them on the road.</p>\n<p>“I think we were finally hitting some shots,” Zornig said. “In games like that, when we come fired up, the flow of the game is a lot better and then that’s when we start hitting shots.”</p>\n<p>Underwood especially was on fire in their last game, scoring a team-high 16 points after recently returning to the starting line-up.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] just going in and doing all that I can to contribute to the team to get a ‘W,’” Underwood said. “[For Long Beach], I’m focusing on rebounding and the things I can control.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road is never easy, but Long Beach is especially great at home at 6-2.</p>\n<p>“I know they just had a tough stretch on the road, but Long Beach is a lot better team at home,” Mitchell said. At the end of the day, if you want to win conference, you have to win road games.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Thursday is set for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43670\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43670\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/","id":794,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[793,792,791],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces CSUN in League Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will welcome visiting Cal State Northridge into the Thunderdome tonight when the Gauchos (8-6 Overall, 3-1 Big West) host the Matadors (5-10, 2-3) in the second of thr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team will welcome visiting Cal State Northridge into the Thunderdome tonight when the Gauchos (8-6 Overall, 3-1 Big West) host the Matadors (5-10, 2-3) in the second of three consecutive home games.

The Matadors, who currently lead the Big West in steals per game, beat UC Davis (1-16, 0-5) on Saturday after losing to Pacific (5-12, 1-4) and Long Beach State (12-6, 5-0).</p>\n<p>Freshman center Alan “Big Al” Williams has started the last three games for the Gauchos, contributing in a big way as a force inside. Williams has averaged 8.8 points per game and a team-leading 10.5 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game, which both rank him second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Al is just a beast,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said of the freshman big man. “You can’t really keep him off the glass … He is so big and strong, but also very athletic.”</p>\n<p>Using Williams has allowed Coach Williams to play a bigger lineup, sliding senior forward Jaime Serna — who often starts at the center position — to power forward. Serna, who was hurt on Jan. 5 against Cal State Fullerton, missed the game at UC Riverside and played minimally against UC Irvine, but is expected to start tonight against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“Our big lineup has been very productive for us,” Coach Williams said. “It allows us to be versatile off the bench and create some nice mismatches.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, with their only losses coming in overtime against San Diego State, and double overtime against UNLV in November. After two consecutive home games this weekend, Santa Barbara will hit the road, where it plays four straight — and seven of the next eight contests — away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“All home games are really important,” Coach Williams said. “You want to win games at home and take care of business as much as possible.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>CENTER: Andrew Bynum (LA Lakers)</p>\n<p>Pretty predictable, yet incredibly amazing. Four out of five starters from Los Angeles make up this extremely well-rounded team that should have chemistry right from the start. How much fun is Chris Paul going to have running the point for this team? — that is, until Kobe decides he wants a fifth All-Star game MVP and starts shooting (and making) fadeaway corner three-pointers with 20 seconds on the shot clock.</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Russell Westbrook (G, OKC Thunder), Monta Ellis (G, GS Warriors), Pau Gasol (F, LA Lakers), Kevin Love (F, MIN Timberwolves), LaMarcus Aldridge (F, POR Trail Blazers), Dirk Nowitzki (F, DAL Mavericks), Marc Gasol (C, MEM Grizzlies)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Kyle Lowry (G, HOU Rockets), Steve Nash (G, PHO Suns), James Harden (G, OKC Thunder), Danilo Gallinari (F, DEN Nuggets), Rudy Gay (F, MEM Grizzlies), David Lee (GS Warriors), Marcin Gortat (PHO Suns)</p>\n<p>It was hard to leave Lowry ­— who is having a huge breakout year — off the roster, but I just couldn’t give him the nod over Ellis, who seems to be overlooked every year. He could make the roster over one of the power forwards, and it would seem to be Nowitzki’s spot he would take. Dirk is having a down year for the Mavs, but I have to believe he will begin to turn it around. I think Nowitzki gets voted in partly based on his resume, and the fact that his team would be complete garbage without him.</p>\n<p>EASTERN CONFERENCE:</p>\n<p>GUARDS: Derrick Rose (CHI Bulls), Dwayne Wade (MIA Heat)</p>\n<p>FORWARDS: LeBron James (MIA Heat), Carmelo Anthony (NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>CENTER: Dwight Howard (ORL Magic)</p>\n<p>The East starters (and these will be the starters) might as well call themselves “The Monstars.” Five hall-of-famers, and five of the best eight players in the league make up the group. Can you say, fast break?</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Rajon Rondo (G, BOS Celtics), Deron Williams (G, NJ Nets), Ray Allen (G, BOS Celtics), Chris Bosh (F, MIA Heat), Josh Smith (F, ATL Hawks), Amar’e Stoudemire (F, NY Knicks), JaVale McGee (C, WAS Wizards)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Brandon Jennings (G, MIL Bucks), Jose Calderon (G, TOR Raptors), Joe Johnson (G, ATL Hawks), Andre Iguodola (F, PHI 76ers), Ryan Anderson (F, ORL Magic), Greg Monroe (F, DET Pistons), Tyson Chandler (C, NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>The East All-Stars were not too difficult to pick, apart from deciding who would back up Howard at center. The spot would normally belong to Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks, but he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last week. I decided to give the spot to JaVale McGee over Tyson Chandler and Spencer Hawes. Chandler has the name recognition (and will probably get the spot) and Hawes is in the midst of a breakout year for a breakout team, but McGee has the athleticism and motor to thrive off the bench for the East. After all, the All-Star game is all about entertainment, and McGee averages a league-leading 3.2 blocks per game, and a respectable 2.5 poster dunks a game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THOUGHTS:</p>\n<p>First off, look at those completely fake and totally not official starting lineups … And reserves, for that matter. WOW. The talent level in the NBA may be at an all-time high, and the days of Jamaal Magloire, Wally Szczerbiak and Mo Williams making the all-star team are clearly over. A young influx of superstar talent (Rose, Durant, Griffin, Love and Bynum) is currently fusing with an already thriving superstar crop (LeBron, Wade, Howard, Durant and Carmelo), while both groups battle with an aging class of all-time greats (Kobe, Allen and Nowitzki) who are refusing to pass the torch just yet. This All-Star game has the potential to contain as many as 12 hall-of-famers in it.</p>\n<p>The West has a much deeper team than the East, starting with its big men. This team may boast the conference’s scariest frontcourt since Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber and Dirk Nowitzki combined in their respective primes in the 2002 All-Star game.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the East holds an advantage in athleticism and speed. With several players to run the lanes — and Rose, LeBron, Rondo and Wade to feed them the rock — we are sure to see several highlight dunks.

Underwood led the attack with 16 points while also contributing seven boards.</p>\n<p>“Coach has emphasized coming out early and setting the tone,” Underwood said. “I’ve obviously been struggling the last few games, so to be able to come out here tonight and play well, it feels great.”</p>\n<p>A 6-2 UCSB run to end the first half gave the Gauchos momentum, which UC Santa Barbara seized and used to gradually pull away.</p>\n<p>“Any run for us is good,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t satisfied, and I just told the team that we needed to win by 20 points. I knew for our mindset going into these next two road games that we had to win by 20 for our own benefit and mindset.”</p>\n<p>The 20-point win was the highest margin of victory for the Gauchos all year.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Kelsey Adrian put the team on her back in the second half, scoring 13 of her 15 points after halftime. She found her touch from behind the arc, knocking down three treys.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a mentality that we all have — that we’re going to keep shooting and the shots are going to fall,” Adrian said. “But, we weren’t just trying to shoot threes. It was getting to the basket, moving the ball around, and finding the open player.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit contributed nine points, all of which came in the first half. And then there was Emilie Johnson, who went without a field goal, but still left her mark with seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and no turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Highlanders 45-26 and gave up only one offensive board.</p>\n<p>“I threatened them on the day off — the one day to prepare — that we were just going to do all rebounding drills,” Mitchell said. “Maybe the reverse psychology worked on them, but we emphasize that every day.”</p>\n<p>For a team that has struggled offensively, UC Santa Barbara looked much smoother on the attack against UCR. Sixty-three points is well above the team’s average of 52 and was its second highest total of the year. They also shot 41.3 percent from the field and tallied 18 assists (a season high), while limiting their turnovers to just nine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos resume play next week with two tough games on the road against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/","id":789,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[788,787,786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Conference: Women’s Basketball Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West loo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>UC Santa Barbara:</strong> <strong>Gauchos</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West look ready to contend for another title.</p>\n<p>An adjustment period with new Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, whose team sits just below .500 at 6-7 with a 1-1 conference start, was to be expected.

We want to win.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish second, right behind conference foe Cal Poly. The two teams received the same number of first place votes, but Cal Poly received more points overall.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos weren’t thinking about the polls. They were concerned with adjusting and readying themselves for conference play. Their preseason schedule included some stiff competition, such as St. Mary’s and Washington State.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a great schedule,” Johnson said. “It was tough and it prepared us for conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began conference on the road, facing rival Cal Poly first. As expected, the game went down to the wire. A three-point play by senior guard Ashlee Burns with 2.3 seconds remaining left the Gauchos winless to start conference for only the second time in the last 17 seasons.</p>\n<p>A week later, Mitchell earned her first conference win as head coach against Cal State Fullerton 39-37, although it wasn’t the Gauchos’ best showing.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that hasn’t changed for the Gauchos this season, it’s their tenacious defense. UCSB allows opponents a mere 49.6 points per game, the best in the Big West and seventh in the nation. In eight of their past 10 games, their opponent hasn’t scored over 50 points. Furthermore, the Gauchos have held their opposition to 37 percent shooting, also first in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to try to outscore teams, but we’re going to try to make it hard on opponents on the defensive end,” Mitchell said. “That’s what I’m about and that’s what this program is about. We have to control what we can, which is defensive intensity.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, there is no apparent leader for UCSB. Certainly no player will be found atop the Big West rankings, but that is Mitchell’s strategy on offense: balance. UCSB has a deep team with many players who can make a difference.</p>\n<p>“Every player should have the confidence to be the go-to player if we need them to,” Mitchell said. “Then teams can’t focus on one player.”</p>\n<p>Currently, junior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team in scoring at 8.9 points per game. She is also second on the squad in rebounding at 7.8 per game, placing her sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets] has that ability to get a double-double every night,” Mitchell said. “Sweets understands we’re not asking too much for her and her athleticism.”</p>\n<p>While Johnson, who played for Team USA in October, has been inconsistent in finding her shooting touch thus far, she continues to lead her team by doing the less noticed things, like distributing the ball and getting steals. She leads the team in both categories with 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per contest, while still averaging 8.4 points.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Emilie] has to score for this team to be successful,” Mitchell said. “She’s such an unselfish player, and she understands it’s important to be a distributor and set the tempo. If she has five or six assists, that means 10 or 12 points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s other senior and captain, Kelsey Adrian, has recently found her stride in the new system, especially from behind the arc. The guard shoots 42.6 percent from three point land, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The two sophomore guards Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig have also proved themselves as offensive threats, averaging 8.6 and 8.2 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a good mix [of players],” Adrian said. “ We have some super athletic players and some shooters. We’re really complimentary of each other. We’re not as big as other teams, but we’re bigger and have bigger basketball IQs.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman cleans up the paint under the hoop night in and night out. She ranks second in rebounds in the Big West at 8.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Kirsten] is instrumental to our success so far,” Mitchell said. “She has to guard the other teams’ tallest and most physical players. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the effort and intensity every night.”</p>\n<p>As Coach Mitchell has preached all year, it most likely will be the little things that determine the Gauchos’ run for a title. Defense is their bread and butter, but rebounding and turnovers may make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding and limiting turnovers have been our keys all year long,” Adrian said. “We’re smaller, so blocking out is going to win or lose us games.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, Santa Barbara’s weakness seems to be consistent offensive production as they continue to work on executing on the offensive end. As a result, they score the least in conference at 51.1 points per game, but overall they still maintain the greatest scoring margin (+1.5).</p>\n<p>“We emphasize [defense],” Johnson said. “That’s been our identity: our toughness on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host UC Riverside this Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball went 3-9 and lost seven consecutive games entering conference play. They opened conference with two straight wins. The lesson: last year’s Big West co-champions and this year’s predicted league champs by the preseason polls should never be counted out of the mix.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and honored to be selected to win it, but we know we’re a long way off of that and know we have to earn it every single day,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “We had some really good competition in preseason and I think it’s prepared us all for the great competition we’re going to face in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs lost last year’s Big West Player of the Year, Rachel Clancy, they return with arguably an even more dangerous threat. Redshirt senior and 2009-10 Big West Player of the Year Kristina Santiago, who missed last year with a torn ACL, is back in action. Against San Diego State on Dec. 21, Santiago made the bold statement that she is completely back, tallying a career high 44 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have a different team, [which is] trying to put it together so we can have as successful a year,” Mimnaugh said. “Santiago is obviously one of the main reasons for that success. She is by all accounts an all-star and somebody that I’m sure the WNBA is having a really close look at as far as an addition to their league.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, the 6’1’’ forward has averaged 24 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Both statistics are good enough to lead the Big West and nationally rank her fifth and 17th, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Ashlee Burns is Cal Poly’s third leading scorer at 8.8 points per game. Opponents should watch out for her three-point shooting; she averages 36.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Ashlee Burns has been a terrific three-point shooter and somebody we count on to extend the defense so they can’t completely collapse on Kristina,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs are extremely strong offensively, preferring high scoring games. They lead the Big West, averaging 72.1 points per outing. The also lead the league in field goal percentage (42 percent) and assists (14.4).</p>\n<p>“We love up-tempo,” Mimnaugh said. “If we can score in the 70s, we’re usually on the victory side.”</p>\n<p>Consequently, Cal Poly also allows their opponents the most points in the Big West, so their game plan is simple: outscore the other team.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacific: Tigers</strong></p>\n<p>The University of the Pacific was picked to finish eighth in the Big West in the Preseason Media Poll, but already has almost as many wins as they did all of last year. The Tigers went 5-11 in conference play last season (9-22 overall) and entered the Big West Tournament as the seventh seed. There, they upset second seed UCSB in the first round before falling to first seed Cal Poly in the second round.</p>\n<p>This season, Pacific is currently in third place in the conference at 2-1 (8-6 overall). The Tigers went 6-5 through a tough nonconference schedule, including a trip to second-ranked Connecticut, and feel they are prepared for Big West play.</p>\n<p>“Now we get into the rhythm of conference play,” Head Coach Lynne Roberts told pacifictigers.com. “The Big West is going to be a close race. We know [each game is] going to be very tough.”</p>\n<p>In its first conference game against Cal State Fullerton on Dec. 29, Pacific won 72-67. In its next showing on Jan. 5 at UC Irvine, the Tigers lost in overtime, 77-75, but rebounded with a big win on Jan. 7, 80-59 at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there were indications that the Tigers were on track for an improvement from last year. On Dec. 5, junior guard Erica McKenzie was named Big West Player of the Week, and on Dec. 12, junior guard Ashley Wakefield earned the same award. McKenzie averages 12.4 points per game, and Wakefield is the team’s leading scorer at 12.6 points per game. On the defensive side, sophomore guard Gena Johnson is third in the conference in blocked shots with 1.4 per game.</p>\n<p>One area Pacific has found success is from behind the arc. McKenzie has made a conference-leading 34 three-pointers thus far this season, and junior Kendall Rodriguez leads the conference in individual three-point field goal percentage with .440. Overall, the team has the second-best three-point field goal percentage in the Big West with .344.</p>\n<p>Roberts hopes that the team can sustain these areas of success, which have contributed to its exceeding expectations so far.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is making sure our players understand we have momentum, but we’re not where we want to be yet,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team enters the season as defending champions of the Big West conference, after making a run in the conference tournament as a fourth seed and losing to Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament. With new Head Coach Jennifer Gross at the helm, the Aggies have started the season 8-5 overall and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After replacing 14-year Head Coach Sandy Simpson, who went 24-9 overall and 10-6 in conference in his final season, new Head Coach Jennifer Gross is trying to bring a fast, up-tempo offense to the team, as well as a tough and physical mentality to both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Although I am in my first year as the head coach at UC Davis, I have been a part of this Aggie program for the past eight years,” Gross said. “Of course, I have my own style as the head coach, but the overall philosophy of our program will remain the same.”</p>\n<p>This season the Aggies are led by their three senior captains. Senior guard Samantha Meggison started all 33 games last season, leading the team in steals with 61 and finishing second on the team with 66 assists. Meggison is leading the Aggies in points with 10.8 points per game and rebounds (4.5). Senior guard Hana Asano is averaging seven points and 3.5 assists per game. Senior forward Kasey Riecks is second on the team, with 10.2 points per game and is on pace to become the 15th Aggie to reach 1,000 career points.</p>\n<p>“Three of our seniors, Samantha Meggison, Kasey Riecks and Hana Asano have been very consistent so far,” Gross said. “Whether it is scoring, rebounding or getting us stops, they have been providing great leadership and have been very productive on the court.”</p>\n<p>After five straight wins to start the season, the Aggies have cooled off and are now 8-5 and 0-1 in conference. Davis is averaging 62.9 points per game, ranking sixth in the conference in offense, including a league-leading 7.6 threes per game, ranking them 14th in all of Division I. Defensively, they are only giving up 63.6 points to their opponents, forcing 19.9 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Gross is focused this year on building strong relations and competing as a unit, fielding a team that can be competitive night in and night out in a very even conference that is up for grabs. The Aggies’ goal for the season is to continue growing throughout the next few months and coming as close as possible to reaching their potential.</p>\n<p>“We have big picture goals like trying to go back to the NCAA tournament,” Riecks said. “But there’s a lot of goals within our team that we want to accomplish through each game, and its getting better every game, and the opportunity that we have to be on the court during practice is amazing.”</p>\n<p><strong>CSUN: Matadors</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team has already seen success this season, sitting at 8-7 overall and 3-0 in the Big West. Last year, the Matadors suffered through a 4-26 overall (4-11 Big West) season. Thus far, Northridge has defeated Irvine, Riverside and Long Beach to stand in first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by senior center Jasmine Erving, who averages 14.7 points per game and has started all 15 games so far, alongside freshman guard Ashlee Guay.</p>\n<p>Erving earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award the week of Nov. 28. She posted two consecutive double-doubles against Colgate and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, freshman guard Janae Sharpe also took home the Big West Player of the Week award, bringing CSUN women’s basketball its second of the season. Sharpe scored 19 points and had seven steals against UC Irvine, leading Northridge to its first league win of the season.</p>\n<p>In steals, Northridge only ranks behind Long Beach this season, partly due to freshman guard Ashlee Guay, who leads the team with 55. She and Sharpe, who has 29 steals, get the ball back for their offense and feed leading scorer Erving. Both Guay and Sharpe have 57 and 36 assists respectively.</p>\n<p>Northridge will face Pacific on the road and Cal Poly at home before facing Santa Barbara at home on Jan. 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>After posting a 6-5 nonconference record, Fullerton has opened its Big West season by going 1-3.</p>\n<p>The Titans lost a close game at Pacific in its Big West opener 72-67, despite a fourth consecutive 20-point effort from senior guard Megan Richardson. Fullerton then upset UC Davis 58-50 two days later, and returned home 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>In the team’s home opener, four different Titans tallied double digit points, but Cal Poly won 76-69. On Saturday, Fullerton played host to visiting UCSB, who escaped with a narrow 39-37 victory.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marcia Foster will be patrolling the sidelines in her third season with Fullerton, who a year after posting a 9-21 (5-11 Big West) overall record, was tabbed to finish fifth in the Conference Preseason Media Poll.</p>\n<p>Richardson was named to the preseason All-Conference team and is the squad’s returning leader in minutes per game (32) and points (14.7). Other returning starters include redshirt senior point guard Lauren Chow and sophomore guard Alex Thomas.</p>\n<p>An indication of Fullerton’s success may be how the team fares away from the friendly confines of Titan Gym.

Because of the team’s recent success, UCSB began this year on much of the country’s radar, receiving votes in the season’s first mid-major poll. Additionally, the Gauchos will be featured on national television as many as seven times during this regular season.</p>\n<p>While recognition on the national scene is nice, it all comes down to conference play for the Gauchos. UCSB received four first-place votes and was picked to finish second in the Big West in the annual preseason media poll released by the conference. Long Beach State (10-6, 3-0), whom the Gauchos beat in the Big West tournament championship in each of the past two seasons, was picked to win the conference.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really put any stock into these preseason ranking and awards,” Williams said. “It is all about being hungry, staying within yourself as you grow during the year you have a chance to achieve. We are highly motivated.”</p>\n<p>Facing Fullerton (10-5, 2-2) in the team’s home opener, UCSB got off to a slow start but behind solid defense, was able to coast to a 77-64 victory. In the team’s Big West opener on the road at Cal Poly (10-6, 1-2) last week, senior standout guard Orlando Johnson’s three-pointer miraculously bounced in with five seconds left to give the Gauchos a one point lead and decisive advantage. The win gave Williams, who is in his 14th season as head coach of the Gauchos, his 223rd career win.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make a statement on the road against a good Cal Poly squad to start off</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t exactly how we pictured it,” Williams said of Johnson’s bouncing three-pointer. “We were hoping to get Orlando going to the rim, but the defense forced him outside, and that was that…”</p>\n<p>With a preseason John R. Wodden Award, preseason Top 50 and Lute Olson Preseason All-American, Johnson leads the Gauchos with 20.4 points per game — good for first place in the Big West and 13th in the nation. After transferring from Loyola Marymount, the 6-foot-5 player was named the Big West MVP as a sophomore two</p>\n<p>seasons ago, and has led the league in scoring each of the past two seasons (including a Gaucho single-season record of 674 points last season).</p>\n<p>Johnson and Nunnally (16.5 points per game, fourth in the Big West) — both of whom were selected to the Preseason Big West All-Conference Team — form the best 1-2 scoring punch in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It helps us a lot,” Johnson said of he and Nunnally. “We are similar in a lot of ways — athletic, long, shoot the ball well … When one of us has an off-night, the other one is usually there to pick up the scoring slack. It’s something that other teams have to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s third returning senior starter is forward Jaime Serna. An All-Big West Tournament pick a year ago, Serna is currently third in the nation with a .692 field goal percentage while averaging 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I would certainly like to see Jaime get more shots up,” Williams said. “He is unbelievably productive, and when he’s active he is the best big man in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Mixed in with the experienced veterans are two key transfers and several freshmen that will be asked to make an immediate impact for the squad. Junior guard Keegan Hornbuckle, a transfer from Colorado, has come on strong as of late after returning from an early season injury. Junior guard Nate Garth, who was forced to sit out last season after transferring from New Mexico, has started nine games for the Gauchos, averaging 2.6 assists per game, as he and freshman point guard T.J. Taylor have split time at point guard.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently has an influx of youth on its bench, with seven freshmen on its roster. Coach Williams will decide which will redshirt as the season continues, as four have played so far on the season.</p>\n<p>“They have all acclimated pretty well,” Williams said of his freshmen. “They will all have to be big contributors for us at some point.”</p>\n<p>Nine different players have started a game for the Gauchos in this young season, and Coach Williams has no plans of slowing down his lineup changes. Based on the opponent and style of play desired, UCSB will continue to thrive on versatility, tweaking lineups to capitalize on advantages.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” senior guard Christian Peterson said. “We are a very versatile team.”</p>\n<p>Last season, in its quest to continue as regular season league champions, UCSB struggled in conference play and limped into the Big West tournament as a fifth seed. An improbable run to win the tournament sent the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tourney, becoming the lowest seed to do so since 1996. Despite a positive end result, UCSB is more focused this season.</p>\n<p>“We have learned from past experiences,” Williams said. “Off the court manifested on the court, and we weren’t cohesive or physically aggressive. It is all about how you continue to grow and improve as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opened up the season on fire, winning its first four games as part of a six-game stretch in November at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>However, arguably the team’s two toughest nonconference opponents yet were due into Santa Barbara next. On Nov. 26, UCSB suffered its first loss of the season in an overtime thriller to No. 25 San Diego State, a team that is slated to become a member of the Big West conference beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>Four days later, another ranked opponent — this time, No. 17 UNLV (15-2) strolled into Santa Barbara fresh off a win over No. 1 over North Carolina. With the rowdy Thunderdome home crowd behind them, the Gauchos battled all game behind Johnson’s 36 points and 10 rebounds, but eventually lost 94-88 in double overtime after a buzzer-beater tip-in from senior center Greg Somogyi forced overtime, and then a UNLV buzzer-beater three-pointer forced a second extra period.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on it, that’s all we can do.”</p>\n<p>With a 4-2 record in its pocket, the UCSB squad hit the road at the beginning of December for a four game 12-day road trip with games at USD, UWash, UC Berkeley and BYU — teams with a combined record of 41-24.</p>\n<p>“It was a great time for a road trip, right after finals. We love going on the road during that time of the year,” Williams explained. “It is a building and bonding time for the team.”</p>\n<p>The trip began positively after the Gauchos bested San Diego 65-61. Three days later at Washington, 24 points and 10 rebounds from Johnson was not enough as the Gauchos ran out of gas late, falling 87-80 to the Huskies. At Cal (12-3), UCSB struggled mightily in its most lopsided game of the year, falling to the Bears 70-50. UCSB ended its road trip with another close loss against a tough opponent in BYU (12-4). The Gauchos fought hard but were unable to pull the game to closer than seven late in the second half, as a season-high 19 turnovers limited the team’s opportunities.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this team knows it all comes down to conference play, and will use its tough nonconference schedule to learn and grow as a cohesive unit.</p>\n<p>“We are still evolving as a team,” Williams explained. “We are still trying to find ourselves in terms of our identity, but going forward we will have to be a team that doesn’t turn the ball over, defends hard and plays very unselfish. If we get those three things going, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Aware of what is at stake, the Gauchos are focused and grounded headed forward.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to just take it one game at a time and get better consistently,” Johnson said. “We want to put ourselves in the best situations and make sure we are on the right path to where we want to go … With the group we have I think will do a good job to not let this season take a bad turn … We want to make this year special, and be a Cinderella team.”</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State: 49ers</strong></p>\n<p>As the reigning No. 2 team in the conference for back-to-back seasons, it may have seemed surprising that Long Beach State would be ranked pre-season No. 1 in the conference. However with four out of five starters returning — including last season’s Player of the Year senior guard Casper Ware — the 49ers will bring back more experienced leaders than any other team in the league.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans have been through a lot of different parts of seasons, good and bad,” Head Coach Dan Monson said. “And we’ve had a lot of both. They’ve changed the Long Beach State program.”</p>\n<p>Forward T.J. Robinson, guard Larry Anderson and forward Eugene Phelps each received All-Big West honors last season, and join Ware as the core of the 49ers squad.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s preseason schedule this year was not only one of the toughest for a Big West team, but one of the most challenging in the nation amongst Division I schools. The 49ers faced perennial powerhouses North Carolina, Kansas, Louisville, San Diego State, Xavier and Pittsburgh, all of which made it to the NCAA tournament last March. CSULB was able to upset Pittsburgh and Xavier, each by a 10-point margin. For Monson, the rigorous preseason schedule is another step toward the goal of improvement.</p>\n<p>“My philosophy is that the preseason is to get yourself ready for the season,” Monson said. “It’s really hard for players or teams to know how good they are unless they play good teams.”</p>\n<p>CSULB is thus far undefeated through its first three games of Big West play after beating UC Irvine 74-60 on the road, Cal Poly 55-50 at home, then Cal State Northridge 81-68 at Northridge. Robinson currently averages a double-double with 12.5 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Ware ranks third in the league in scoring with 16.6 points per game, the highest average of any 49er.</p>\n<p>In each of its Big West championship appearances during the past two years, CSULB has suffered a defeat to UC Santa Barbara. With the return of four experienced seniors this season, Monson hopes to continue playing through March for the first time since 2007.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just losing to Santa Barbara … we didn’t play well in the [Big West] tournament,” Monson said. “[This year] we have the opportunity to compete for a championship.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>Projected to finish fourth in the preseason Big West conference poll, Cal State Fullerton is off to an impressive start in the 2011-12 basketball season, compiling a 10-5 record (2-2 Big West).</p>\n<p>The Titans, who finished sixth in the Big West last season with a 11-20 record (7-9 in the conference) are headlined by a trio of incoming transfers who have boosted the talent of the team tremendously.</p>\n<p>“It’s been terrific, I don’t know if I’ve ever had a team that gets along as well as these kids do,” nine-year Head Coach Bob Burton said. “They blend in very well; that was the difference of us winning 11 games last year and having 10 already at the halfway point. The difference has been the transfers.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Omondi Amoke, a transfer from UC Berkeley, has led the Titans in rebounding with 8.5 boards per game, good for second in the Big West. Amoke also ranks fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 11.5 points a game.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only given us good scoring, rebounding and defense, but a lot of leadership too,” Burton said. “The kids have appointed him the captain of the team unanimously.”</p>\n<p>Pacing the highest-scoring offense in the Big West have been a pair of junior guards in Kwame Vaughn and D.J. Seeley, transfers from San Francisco and Berkeley, respectively. Vaughn is second on the team with 15.3 points per game and leads Fullerton with over four assists a contest. Seeley meanwhile is the team’s leading scorer at 15.5 points a game on the season.</p>\n<p>Fullerton used a seven-game winning streak, the last two of which were in conference, to come into Big West play strong before dropping tightly contested matchups to UCSB and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We actually lost a couple of games I thought we should have won, but all in all I’m really happy with the preseason we had,” Burton said. “Starting 2-0 in league has really been great for us.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the starting five for the Titans are sophomore guard Isiah Umipig and senior forward Orane Chin, the most veteran player on Fullerton’s roster.</p>\n<p>Burton envisions his team playing tough down the stretch and competing for a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s feasible, but it’s going to be very difficult,” Burton said. “Obviously Long Beach and Santa Barbara are the two dominant teams in the league. I think in this league anything can happen. I think we have the capability to do it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Touting the Big West’s top defense in points allowed per game, Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6 record (1-2 in conference) entering the second week of conference play.</p>\n<p>Finishing last season second in the Big West at 15-15 (10-6 conference), the Mustangs were picked to finish third in the preseason conference poll.</p>\n<p>“Our number one goal: keep improving,” three-year Head Coach Joe Callero said. “If we keep improving, we feel like we have enough talent this year that we can be competitive and we have a chance to win the postseason tournament and get to the big dance.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs is senior forward David Hanson, a preseason Big West first team selection after garnering second team honors last year. Hanson currently leads Cal Poly in scoring at 10.9 points a game, while second on the team in rebounds, averaging over five a game.</p>\n<p>“The best part about David is that he is such a calm and confident guy,” Callero said. “He brings not just great play, but a great maturity and great poise, and that’s what you rely on out of your seniors.”</p>\n<p>While securing impressive road victories over Fresno State and USC, the Mustangs have fallen short against a number of top teams including two five-point losses to both DePaul and St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“We had five or six games against good if not great teams,” Callero said. “I think it has prepared us well. I think a lot of teams in the conference have played really good preseason games.”</p>\n<p>Conference play meanwhile has been cruel to Cal Poly with a 55-50 loss at Long Beach and a 58-57 defeat from UCSB at the hands of an Orlando Johnson last second three-pointer.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs rebounded with a win over Fullerton on Saturday for their first conference victory.</p>\n<p>“I think we would have liked the bounces to have gone a little bit better,” Callero said in reference to Johnson’s winning shot. “That always hurts. You win some games that way and you lose some games that way. The first two games we played very well, we just got pinched in the last minute of the game.”</p>\n<p>Playing important roles for the Mustangs this season are a pair of senior transfers from Hagerstown College in forward Will Taylor and point guard Amaurys Fermin. Both were eligible to play last season but were redshirted due to academic and health issues.</p>\n<p>Taylor is fourth in the conference with a team-high 7.8 rebounds per game while averaging better than 10 points a contest. Fermin meanwhile also averages over 10 points and is second in the conference with four assists per game.</p>\n<p>“It gives us a really true experienced point guard in Fermin and gives us another real aggressive rebounder and post up player [in Taylor],” Callero said. “They played junior college together so they have very good team chemistry too. They really know how to play well together.”</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside: Highlanders</strong></p>\n<p>There are few teams in the Big West playing as well as the UC Riverside Highlanders are right now. After stumbling out of the gates to a 1-4 start, they have won six of their last 10 games and sport a 7-8 (1-1 in conference) record early on in the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we got off guard a little bit,” Head Coach Jim Wooldridge said. “I think we all felt that since we had a number of returning players that we would have a better identity early on. We got humbled a bit, and then we started to realize what we had to do to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Like most coaches, Wooldridge pays little mind to preseason rankings. He knows that his team will face stiff completion from the rest of the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming into the season that Santa Barbara and Long Beach were the two best teams in the league, and then from there it is a mixture of teams,” Wooldridge said.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are lead by a pair of senior guards, Phil Martin and Kareem Nitoto, who lead the team in most statistical categories. They stand out most, however, in their contribution to the team’s offensive output. Martin leads the team with a whopping 242 points, 16.1 per game, and Nitoto is second with 151 points (10.1 per game). In comparison, the third highest scorer on the team has put up just 83 points.</p>\n<p>“They are critical to our success,” Wooldridge said. “If you look at our scoring, we’re somewhat limited in that department. If those guys play well offensively then it really gives us a chance to win ball games. We don’t have a whole lot of other options currently, so we have to rely on both of those guys to play that role for us.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lately reaped the benefits of junior guard Robert Smith, who transferred from Santa Clara this season and had to sit out the first several games due to the NCAA’s transfer rules. Even with the missed time he has put up nine points per game for a total of 72 points.</p>\n<p>“He’s changed our team,” Wooldridge said. “He’s helped us win a few ball games at home and on the road. He’s a talented young man. He’s brought a level of confidence to the other players on our team, because they know that they can rely on him to make plays.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders’ real strength, however, lies on the defensive side of the ball. They lead their opponents in steals and blocks per game and are +0.1 in the turnover margin. In order to succeed in a competitive Big West, they will need to continue their strong defensive play.</p>\n<p>“Well the numbers look pretty good right now,” Wooldridge said. “I think we can play better defense. I think that’s going to be the staple of this team. It is the only way we can consistently win ball games.”</p>\n<p>Though 1-1 is only a so-so start to the conference portion of their schedule, the Highlanders have the potential to contend for a Big West title. They enter conference competition playing well, and, with players like Martin, Nitoto and Smith leading the way, they have to potential to be a force to be reckoned with in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Defensively, [we need to] finish possessions get defensive rebounds [and not] allow second chance opportunities to creep into the ball game,” Wooldridge said. “Offensively, when we’ve been successful, we’ve had good balance; we’ve moved the ball; we share the ball; we get the ball into the lane.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are coming off a two-game road win streak and will now head home to do battle with UCSB and Cal Poly. Both are teams they must beat in order to contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team enters its fifth season in the Big West conference after finishing last season at the bottom of the conference table, finishing 10-20 overall and 4-12 in conference play. Led by new head coach, Jim Les, the Aggies have started this season on a nine-game losing streak, going 1-12 and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After coming off their worst season since entering the Big West conference, Les has the task of replacing most of its offense from last season including its top two scorers in Mark Payne and Joe Harden, as well as losing 49.5 percent of their assists and 48.9 percent in steals. With only two seniors on the team, the Aggies have struggled in finding consistency so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Right now we’ve been inconsistent with the guys we need to step up,” Les said. “We’re searching for answers in terms of guys that can replace that productivity. We need multiple guys to step up and play, and be more productive for us.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Aggies this season will be senior guard Eddie Miller who started all 30 games last season and finished second on the team in total steals (32) and third in scoring (12.5). Last year’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year, sophomore guard/forward Josh Ritchart is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 12.2 points per game and is team leader in blocks with 10.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will have to replace junior guard Ryan Sypkens who, before going down with a knee injury for the season was averaging 14.5 points per game. Head coach’s son, sophomore guard Tyler Les also appears to play a prominent role in the offense. Last year Les played in 25 games and shot 50 percent from behind the arc and is second in the league in three pointers (2.75).</p>\n<p>“[Tyler] is getting more playing time and he’s in a system and culture he’s comfortable with, and that’s allowing him to step up and produce,” Les said. “He’s a young player, he needs to continue to grow and get better. His work ethic in practice every day is allowing him to have success on game night.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies have had a rough start to the season where they have lost their last nine games including their first conference match against Cal State Fullerton. Davis’ offense ranks eighth in the conference with 62.5 points per game and are last in defense giving up 75.9 points per game, averaging 15.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>In his first year at UC Davis, Head Coach Les is trying to bring enthusiasm and relevance to the program by bringing in an up tempo and high scoring offense to the team, which is ranked second in the conference in three point field goal percentage (36.5), but has struggled in bringing in a tough, physical defensive mentality to the team.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten off to a rough start but I think we’ve made some strides,” Tyler Les said. “Defensively there’s a lot more intensity, a lot of ball pressure, it’s definitely helping us individually and as a team. If we play hard and bring it every night we should be at the top of the conference.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/","id":788,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[787,786,785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Good Lo’dy wo’dy / I just took more shots than Kobe” Big Sean didn’t need to search too far to find a metaphor with the word ‘shot’ involved.

Kobe took 23 shots during the game, connected on 11 and finished with 28 points in the one-point defeat. The squad’s second game was a loss against the Kings, in which Kobe took 24 shots, connected on 10 and tallied 29 points.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played organized basketball you may have heard some variation of the phrase, ‘You can’t make it unless you take it.’ I think I’ve found Bryant’s next tattoo.</p>\n<p>The Lakers followed their two-game losing streak with three consecutive wins, in all of which the Mamba took less than 20 shots.</p>\n<p>The first 10 games of this season have shown that if Kobe keeps his shot attempts under 20, the Lakers will win. That doesn’t mean he needs to hold back on his shooting or even limit his shots per game for the rest of the year. However, it does mean that there are certain techniques and plays the Lakers use during these games that, if recognized, would benefit them in future matchups. Whether that means passing out of a baseline double-team instead of opting for the fall-away, or finding new options out of Mike Brown’s offense [Bynum went for 21 points and 22 rebounds against Houston!], there is a solution, and it doesn’t have to be Kobe slowing down.</p>\n<p>This year’s outcome of a shortened NBA season would without a doubt be different if the full schedule was put in place in November. The effects of 66 games as opposed to 82 this year are daunting to say the least, and will be made apparent throughout the year leading into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>1) Sixty-six games will be played over the course of just four months. That’s approximately one game every other day, three to four games per week. Combined with the exhaustion of travel and practice on off-days, this season will prove to be one of the most challenging for many players. Age will be a huge contributing factor toward the success of teams. The Oklahoma City Thunder are the youngest squad in the league, with an average age of just over 24 years old. They’ll be able to respond physically to the demands of the season, while veteran teams such as the Celtics or the defending champion Mavericks will have a harder time adapting to the rigors of this year. Think about this: Dallas and Boston rank No. 1 and 2 in oldest teams in the NBA, based on average player age.</p>\n<p>2) Come playoff time, seeds won’t matter. It’ll seem like March Madness, where any team can be upset at any time. Look at the 1999 season, which was cut to 50 games because of a lockout. The No. 8 seeded Knicks made it all the way to the championship. Because of this year’s shortened season, teams will not be able to gain as much experience of playing out-of-conference foes, and thus will be less prepared, setting the foundation for upsets across the league.</p>\n<p>3) Rookies drafted in last summer’s draft didn’t have the opportunity for fall workouts with their team or their new coaches, which severely limits them during this first part of the season. Teams that would normally be relying on their new rookie talent, such as Kyrie Irving at Cleveland, will be hurting as their rookies may need more time to adapt to the NBA. If a team is reliant on their rookie class, they may need to use this shortened season as a learning tool for next year.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Brent Pella wonders how many shots Big Sean has really taken this season.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines/","id":820,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[819,818,817],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thunder & Lightning The Oklahoma City Thunder have gotten off to the fast start we expected, but at 8-2 the Thunder may be even better than advertised.

The offensive-minded Westbrook needs to learn how to be effective as a game manager and pass-first point guard. He doesn’t need to transform himself, just be able to recognize when he should facilitate and feed the ball to Durant every time down the floor. Not impossible, right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to Lob City</strong></p>\n<p>And so the tale is told … David Stern, in his customary tyrannical grandeur and douchebag-ness, declared that the mighty Lakers could not acquire the treasure, and he disallowed the exchange. The one whom they call Chris Paul was stuck in purgatory, but a new land was to arise out of the ashes of controversy.</p>\n<p>LOB CITY was born!</p>\n<p>The Clippers are 4-2 so far, and have looked both like one of the best teams at times and one of the worst at others. It would seem that this inconsistency stems from adding three (Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups and Caron Butler) of the team’s six most important players to the mix during this shortened offseason. These inconsistencies would be more likely to disappear if Vinny Del Negro weren’t the head coach.</p>\n<p>Either way, CP3 needs to shoot the ball more and be more aggressive as a scorer offensively. Blake Griffin needs to keep doing his thing. DeAndre Jordan needs consistency. Billups needs humility (he is no longer a volume shooter, but a three-point shooting veteran presence at this stage in his career). And Vinny Del Negro needs a new haircut.</p>\n<p>Like a 40-year-old hippie wandering through the Coachella desert on acid, this team is still finding itself. Mainly, the Clippers need to learn how to win. Close-game experience in situations that actually matter, despite being virtually nonexistent in Clipper history, can’t be accurately replicated in practice. It comes with familiarity.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Ryan Porush is tellin’ people what they need like he’s in the ‘Wizard of Oz’ or some shit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-10/tuesday-ballin-ed-ed-sports-editors-pella-porush-tackle-early-season-nba-headlines-2/","id":824,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[823,822,821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Top CSF 77-64, Improve to 2-0 Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team captured its second straight Big West win in the Thunderdome last Thursday night, beating visiting Cal State Fullerton 77-64 in the team’s conference home opener.

We aren’t going to play as fast, but have advantages inside and on the glass.”</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a sluggish start offensively in the first half, though their defense remained stout. The Gauchos took an 18-16 lead on a three-pointer from sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle. The shot sparked an 11-0 run for the Gauchos and they entered halftime leading 35-21.</p>\n<p>Fullerton battled to come back to a 52-43 score with under 10 minutes left in the second half, but the Gauchos responded. An alley-oop dunk from junior point guard Nate Garth to senior center Greg Somogyi ended that Titan run and put the Gauchos back in control. Up by eight points with just over a minute left, it was Johnson’s turn to ward off a Titan run with six consecutive free throws (10-of-11 on the night). The Gauchos’ lead never dipped below eight as they secured the win 77-64.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” Peterson said of the team’s different looks. “We are a very versatile team and can be dangerous when we exploit our lineups against opposing teams.”</p>\n<p>Johnson paced the Gauchos with 23 points and six rebounds despite a poor shooting night (5-for-18 on field goals). Nunnally scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half, and Hornbuckle added nine points, five rebounds and two blocks. Garth recorded a game-high five assists.</p>\n<p>A scary moment for the Gauchos occurred with 12:10 left in the game when senior forward Jaimé Serna rose up to score on a driving layup and was fouled. Serna fell hard to the floor, landing on, and injuring, his right wrist. Luckily for Santa Barbara, X-rays taken the following day came back negative, and Serna is currently day-to-day.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased with the win,” coach Williams said. “[Fullerton] is a really good team. … Overall, it was a productive night for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/","id":822,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[821,820,819],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":45,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
