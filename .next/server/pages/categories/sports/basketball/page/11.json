Curry racked up an amazing double-double, scoring a game-high 31 points and 14 rebounds, while Holt had a well-rounded 5 rebounds and 5 assists to go along with her 21-point performance.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another dominating double-double night, draining a team-high 27 points, and grabbing 14 boards, which was tied with Riverside’s Curry for the most in the game.</p>\n<p>With just under 9 minutes left to play in regulation, UCSB trailed by 11, the score sitting at 53-42 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter began to heat up for the Gauchos, as Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar combined for an explosive 25 of the team’s 32 points in the last quarter. Despite their valiant effort, though, the home team still trailed by six, the score 68-62 with only 41 seconds left to play.</p>\n<p>Sahar scored a clutch three-pointer from beyond the arc, and after the opponents scored, Sahar attempted to drain another shot from downtown, but was fouled and knocked down all three free throw attempts, to bring the game to 69-68, UCSB behind by just 1 point.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders were fouled and scored just one of their two free throws, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter passed the ball to Edelman who had a good look and shot the ball in to tie the game up at 70, with just 8 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Curry attempted a shot to take the game for UCR, but the shot fell out of bounds, possession then belonging to the home team.</p>\n<p>It looked as if the Gauchos would be set up to play their first overtime game since the 2014-2015 season, but that turned out to not be the case.</p>\n<p>While regulation seemingly ended with the score tied up at 70-70, the officials put 1.5 seconds back on the game clock after review.</p>\n<p>That last second and a half was sufficient enough for the home team to get the walk off win.</p>\n<p>Toler inbounded the pass to freshman guard Sarah Bates who was fouled and forced to leave the game after being injured on the play.</p>\n<p>Coming in to complete the play by shooting her free throws, Bates knocked in both attempts, allowing UCSB to win the game without extra OT minutes.</p>\n<p>It was a special night in the Thunderdome, as the 27 points for Edelman are tied for her career-high, with this being her sixth double-double in the last seven games. Toler had 10 dimes, which is also tied for her career-high in assists, and her second straight home game dishing out double digits assists. Sahar ended the game with a season-high 21 points, and just two points away from her career-high.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot at 46.3 percent on 25-for-54 shooting, while UCR scored at a slightly higher 49.1 percent on 27-for-55 shooting. Both teams were aggressive offensively, the home team just showing more assertiveness late down the stretch.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are geared to play their last game of the regular season on the road against Hawai’i on Thursday, Mar. 1 at 9:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/","id":949,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[948,947,946],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Puts 3-Game Win Streak on the Line Against Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following three straight conference wins, UCSB will hope to take out its bitter green rival Cal Poly and take control of third place in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81172\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"256722274\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81190\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81172\" data-attachment-id=\"81172\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/drea-toler-slides-around-the-defense-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drea Toler slides around the defense.

She averaged 16 points and 11.5 rebounds in her two games last week.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, Edelman wasn’t alone in achieving a double-double against UCI, as redshirt senior Drea Toler also managed to earn a double-double. Dishing out 10 dimes and scoring a commanding 10 points, Toler was on fire.</p>\n<p>Following the win, the Gauchos are currently 11-14 overall and 8-5 in the Big West. They are also winners of three straight games. The outcome of the game places UCSB one game closer to second-seeded UC Irvine in the standings.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, Santa Barbara is in third place in the Big West, tied with Cal Poly, their next opponent.</p>\n<p>This upcoming game has serious conference contentions, as it gives either team the opportunity to be the lone third seed and to inch closer to the two-seed spot.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be hosting Santa Barbara as they come off a loss from Cal State Northridge, where they fell 86-66, but not from a lack of effort.</p>\n<p>There are some dangerous players on the Mustangs, and UCSB will need to be on high alert for their balanced attack.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Dynn Leaupepe scored a monster 29 points in the last game for Cal Poly and averages 25.5 points per game during conference play on 46 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Her offensive approach is a potent one and is something the Gauchos will have to guard against if they want to contain their opponent.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch out for is senior guard Lynn Leaupepe. Grabbing seven rebounds in the last game versus Cal State Northridge, L. Leaupepe has over 30 offensive rebounds and 50 defensive rebounds in recent conference games, averaging six rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Boxing out and grabbing boards is going to have a major impact on Cal Poly’s game versus USCB, so it will be interesting to see how the Gauchos match Cal Poly’s intensity under the basket. In their last game, Cal Poly shot 41.2 percent from the field on 28-for-68 shooting.</p>\n<p>Their offense fell flat in the third quarter, which is where CSUN began to run away. If the Mustangs keep their foot on the gas with their normal scoring attack, they will be a tough opponent to beat.</p>\n<p>Averaging 65 points per game on 40.6 percent shooting, the Gauchos will face a worthy opponent in the Mustangs, who average 70 points per game on 39.8 percent shooting. Two equally matched opponents with a lot to play for.</p>\n<p>Look out for the bench play on both teams. Santa Barbara usually has a superior bench in comparison to their opponents, their reserves often making worthy contributions to the game.</p>\n<p>Not to be dismissed, though, is the bench play of Cal Poly. The home team also has a great bench, which was evident in their last bout, where the reserves put 37 points on the board.</p>\n<p>Both benches match up nicely, and their head-to-head battle will be a big influence on the outcome of the game. This will be a Blue-Green Rivalry game to remember, as both teams have serious consquences on the line.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 21, at the Robert A.

The Gauchos came to play Saturday night, demonstrating confidence and a new sense of direction during their blowout of the second-place Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t stop attacking,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We stayed aggressive and we buckled down and still defended when we couldn’t score. Those two things we haven’t been consistent with but we were pretty good tonight. We kept our foot on the gas pedal.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have won their last three games and are now tied with rival Cal Poly for third in the Big West at 8-5 in conference play and 11-14 overall. With the loss, Irvine remains second in the Big West standings at 9-3 and 17-9 overall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A barrage of scoring late in the first quarter and into the second gave Santa Barbara its early lead. Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman tallied another double-double with apparent ease as she recorded 12 points and 15 rebounds. It was Edelman’s fourht double-double finish in the team’s last five games.</p>\n<p>Fellow redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler joined Edelman with a double-double of her own that featured 10 points and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper’s game-high 15 points combined with Sarah Bates’ 11 and Sarah Porter’s 12 put the game out of reach for Irvine.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter, both teams got into foul trouble early, as Bates picked up two fouls and Irvine’s star junior guard Morgan Green got called for her third foul around the five minute mark.</p>\n<p>An odd display of foul calls paired with back and forth scoring resulted in Santa Barbara and Irvine being tied at 12 following a jumper by Roper with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A minute later, Irvine took the lead via freshman forward Jordan Sanders’ mid-range jumper. Unfortunately for Irvine, Sanders’ shot would be the Anteaters’ last field goal until 4:22 remained in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Down 14-12, the Gauchos flipped the script on Irvine in a huge way. Sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez sunk a three to start the scoring-frenzy for Santa Barbara, which featured two more threes from Roper, an Edelman layup and a Tal Sahar buzzer-beating corner three to close out the quarter up 26-15.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the second quarter on a 9-0 run as part of its 23-1 run carried over from the end of the first.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored six-straight herself and another Sahar three-ball made it 35-15 in favor of the Gauchos. Down 20, Irvine finally got a shot to fall junior guard when Andee Ritter knocked down a jumper.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters made just 3 of their 13 shot attempts in the quarter but avoided the 20-point deficit at halftime, as they trailed 40-24. Irvine’s struggle to scoring nine points in the quarter was due much credit to UCSB’s defensive prowess during the game as the Anteaters had reached triple digits in scoring twice in their last three games.</p>\n<p>After sitting out for the entirety of the second quarter with two fouls, Bates knocked down a three to start the second half and followed it up with a jumper for five-straight points.</p>\n<p>The freshman guard Bates continues to impress this season, as she scored 7 of her 12 points in the third to maintain the Gauchos comfortable lead.</p>\n<p>Haleigh Talbert knocked down a jumper for Irvine just over the 6-minute mark and a 9-6 run by Irvine put the Anteaters within 18 to start the fourth.</p>\n<p>The final quarter opened with yet another bucket from beyond the arc via Roper, extending UCSB’s lead to 21. Sophomore center Natalia Bruening gave the Gauchos good production off the bench, as she scored five points in the fourth and allowed Henrickson to rest Edelman when needed.</p>\n<p>Bruening’s layup and then another Roper three-pointer gave UCSB a 24-point lead with still over 8 minutes remaining. A short burst of scoring from Irvine placed the Anteaters within 16 at the 6-minute mark, but their Hack-a-Shaq strategy of fouling Drea Toler everytime she got the ball didn’t play out well for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB made 13-of-22 free throws in the fourth quarter to secure the win down the stretch. Toler herself was 8-14 from the line and had 10 points as part of UCSB’s 29-point quarter. Despite managing a 20-point quarter as a team, Irvine simply couldn’t catch up to the hot-handed Gauchos, falling 82-55.</p>\n<p>Morgan Green, who came into the game averaging 24.5 points per game, got locked down by UCSB. The Gauchos switched on screens to contain Green and forced her into 9 turnovers on 0-8 shooting from three.</p>\n<p>“Morgan Green, who’s so explosive and such a good one-on-one player, obviously between Drea and [Akilah Jennings] they did a really good job,”Henrickson said.“We did a really good job of not fouling her, we were much more disciplined.”</p>\n<p>Green led her team with 13 points on a less-than efficient night finding the net. Irvine shot 29.9 percent from the field and only 10.5 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outrebounded Irvine 51-37 and outscored the Anteaters in the paint 24-18, but it was UCSB’s capitalization off turnovers that separated the two teams. While UCSB committed 22 turnovers, Irvine turned those turnovers into only 13 points whereas the Gauchos converted Irvine’s 19 turnovers into 31 points.</p>\n<p>On a three-game winning streak and tied with Cal Poly for third in the Big West, the Blue-Green rivalry this coming week will have high stakes for each team seeking to make a run in the standings as conference play nears its end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/","id":946,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[945,944,943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Rout Titans in Home Showdown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A blowout of a victory by the UCSB women's basketball team over Cal State Fullerton earned the Gauchos their second-straight win.

Along with smashing down a game-high 20 points, she also grabbed 8 rebounds, which was also tied for a game-high, as she elevated the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Makala Roper started in place of injured freshman point guard Danae Miller, and nearly finished the game with a strong triple-double. She contributed 11 points, notched 7 rebounds, and tied her career-high of 9 assists.</p>\n<p>The home team got out to an early lead, but its opponents stormed back to gain the lead and made the score 9-8 halfway through the first quarter.</p>\n<p>It was all USCB from then on out, as Santa Barbara went on a run that carried its way well into the second quarter, and suddenly the score was 32-11. A lot of the run was attributed to Edelman’s eight points in the paint.</p>\n<p>UCSB packed the paint and regulated it all night, keeping CSUF to just 18 paint points all game, compared to its dominating 38 points down low.</p>\n<p>It was 41-29 at the end of the first half, and Santa Barbara looked to be in a commanding position.</p>\n<p>The home team continued to heavily outscore its opponent for the remainder of the game, as the Titans only managed to get within an eight-point deficit, cutting the score to 50-42 at one point during the second half.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held its opponents to a 21-for-61 shooting performance – a 34 percent shooting night – while it scored 28-of-55 shot attempts at an impactful 50 percent.</p>\n<p>Despite having faced the Titans just five nights before, the Gauchos knew they couldn’t let their guard down against a team hungry for a win.</p>\n<p>“It was about who was going to make the least amount of mistakes, and it was about who was going to do more of what worked for them in the last game and do less of what didn’t,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We reduced the stretches where we don’t execute or do our job. If you’re trying to get it right, you will improve. And this group has really improved.”</p>\n<p>Things in the Big West are heating up, and the Gauchos are beginning to pick up momentum. They’ve had some rough close losses along the way, but Coach Henrickson is certain that this team is determined.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to sustain the effort and the intensity and the activity that it takes to be successful. We know we are who we believe we are,” she said.</p>\n<p>The confidence is palpable with UCSB, and it will need to carry that into its next game agaiunst UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play its second consecutive game at home, as the Gauchos will host UCI at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 17 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/","id":943,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[942,941,940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Stay Afloat in Big West Conf., Host CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are one win above the .500 mark in Big West play and have a chance to get on a roll going into their matchup against Cal State Fullerton.

The game, though it was close, ended with Santa Barbara getting the lead back and gaining the victory.</p>\n<p>Working hard for every basket they got, UCSB was able to edge out the home team by shooting a slightly higher field goal percentage (42.6 percent), compared to Cal State Fullerton’s (39.2 percent).</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another big game, achieving her third straight double-double with a stellar performance consisting of 22 points on 10-for-15 shooting and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Hannah Thompson led the Titans with 13 points, and freshman forward Carolyn Gill had a commanding 11 points and 8 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Gill has been a big factor for CSUF both offensively and defensively, as she got buckets and proceeded to force the Gauchos to commit several turnovers. The tandem duo of Thompson and Gill will be worth watching for Santa Barbara in the next game.</p>\n<p>Bench play for UCSB will need to be productive to keep up with CSUF’s bench play.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Triann Thompson and freshman forward Xinavane Foreman give the Titans a spark off the bench, and will need to be contained on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Thompson flirted with a double-double, contributing eight points and seven rebounds, while Foreman ended the game with six points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>When asked about what the team did right to end the game with a win and what she plans on implementing for Thursday’s matchup, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson noted:</p>\n<p>“I thought defensively we played great and had good pressure on the ball. We defended their half court sets. But give them credit. They did a great job,” Henrickson said. “They shot over 50 percent in both the third and fourth quarter to make it a ball game and take the lead. So we’ll take what we did to get up nearly 20, we’ll take what we didn’t do to give up and lose the lead and then we’ll take what we did to win the game. So there are three lessons in that.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson went on to speak about how the team game plan for the upcoming game will not differentiate much from their game plan the last time the Gauchos played the Titans just a few days ago.</p>\n<p>The visiting Gauchos showed a big defensive presence against Cal State Fullerton in the matchup and will need to bring that same energy and pressure on Thursday, if they want to end the game with the same result.</p>\n<p>Though CSUF is only 2-8 in conference play, Henrickson made it known that their upcoming opponents are not to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>“You can’t look at their record and say ‘they are this, because this is what their record is.’ They’re not. They have been in single-digit games, just like ours. We don’t do that going into the game,” she explained.</p>\n<p>“We are hunting and building momentum to try and get success. We’ve got to make sure to bring our A-game for forty minutes because we did for a chunk of the game, but obviously not when we allowed them to shoot such a high percentage from the floor. They got layups, offensive rebounds and got to the free throw line. We’ve got to turn them over and be more aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to remain focused on both ends of the court and be more conscientious about keeping any lead they build so as to obtain and sustain the advantage against CSUF.</p>\n<p>Catch the Gauchos against Cal State Fullerton at home in the Thunderdome tonight, Feb. 15 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Feb. 15</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/","id":942,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[941,940,939],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho-Mania: MBB Carries 7-Game Streak Into LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Holding on to first place in the Big West is one of the main priorities for the UCSB men's basketball team.

The road to the NCAA Tournament will likely go through at least one of these three teams, after all.</p>\n<p>The first two teams on the schedule, Long Beach State and UC Davis, are both locked in a three-way tie with Cal State Fullerton for third place in the Big West. They are behind the Gauchos and the Anteaters, respectively.</p>\n<p>First up are the Long Beach State 49ers, who have struggled against their peers in the Big West standings. The 49ers are 1-4 in games against UCD, UCI and CSUF, with the lone win coming against the Titans back in January.</p>\n<p>Those four losses make up the entirety of Long Beach’s conference blemishes.</p>\n<p>The 49ers are 7-4 in the Big West, and they have suffered from some bad luck with three single-digit losses.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Long Beach game plan revolves around transfer senior Gabe Levin. The 6-7 forward is averaging a team-high 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in around 30 minutes of action a night.</p>\n<p>Levin has outright led the 49ers in scoring in all but two of their Big West games, and is leading the conference in scoring in Big West play. Unsurprisingly, the senior is key to Long Beach success, and is a common focal point for defenses.</p>\n<p>Opposing defenses can afford to focus on Levin because his supporting cast hasn’t done much to make them pay for doing so.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have four players – Max Heidegger, Jalen Canty, Leland King II and Gabe Vincent – between Levin and his next closest teammate in conference scoring.</p>\n<p>Part of that is due to junior transfer guard Bryan Alberts’s nine-game absence due to injury, but the Gonzaga transfer has been slow to readjust since returning to the lineup four games ago.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Temidayo Yussuf has stepped up to give the 49ers another low post threat, and put up a 17 point, 11 rebound double-double in his most recent game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host the Gauchos on Thursday, which plays to a major advantage for a Long Beach State team that is 7-4 at the Walter Pyramid and just 5-8 in away games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be able road warriors with a 7-5 away record, including a major win in Davis over the Aggies most recently.</p>\n<p>That win last Thursday is what propelled UCSB to their solitary perch atop the standings, but it’s unlikely to be a comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Even if the Gauchos are able to fight off the 49ers on Thursday, they’ll then have to take on the Aggies once more on Saturday, this time in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>With a home winning streak of 11 games to start the season, the longest such run in school history, the Gauchos have reason to feel confident even against such formidable and motivated guests as the Aggies.</p>\n<p>In the first matchup, UCSB controlled much of the game, aside from a strong stretch run by UC Davis to make things close late in the game. Junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, receiving extra minutes in the absence of Canty, was instrumental late in the game with eight points, all in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to overcome Canty’s absence due to a suspension for violating team rules, but the team has made no announcements on the timetable for his return. Barring a change in status before Thursday, UCSB will likely have to adapt once again.</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos were able to do so thanks to a balanced team offensive effort. Four players finished in double-digits, with Leland King II leading the way with 19 points and 15 rebounds, his fifth double-double of Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t be the only team dealing with a mysterious and impactful suspension on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCD’s star forward, Chima Moneke, has missed the team’s last three games after being sent home prior to the team’s Feb. 3 game against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are 2-0 without their suspended forward, the Aggies have struggled a bit more, going 1-2 while sliding down from first place in the Big West to a tie for third.</p>\n<p>The reasons and timetable for Moneke’s return are still up in the air, so it’s quite possible both teams will once again be shorthanded on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Junior guard TJ Shorts II has stepped up in Moneke’s absence with almost 27 points per game in the last three games. Junior Siler Schneider has also taken on an expanded role, but the Aggies haven’t been able to fully replicate Moneke’s production.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a tough midterms week ahead of them, with two games against teams with a combined conference record of 14-8.</p>\n<p>A successful week however, would cement the team’s status as the one to best in Big West play, and push UCSB past 20 wins for the first time since 2009-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Long Beach State on Thursday in Long Beach at 7 p.m. The ’Chos then host UC Davis in the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 15 of the Feb. 15</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/","id":947,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[946,945,944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edelman’s 3rd Straight Double Double Leads UCSB Past Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After losing to UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB women's basketball team returned to form Saturday night, defeating Cal St. Fullerton 59-52.

The Gauchos forced Fullerton into turning the ball over on 19 occasions, and for much of the game, the Titans struggled against Santa Barbara’s defense.</p>\n<p>With the road win, UCSB moves to 9-13 overall and remains at 5th in the Big West at 6-5 in conference play. Redshirt senior Drew Edelman continues to play a huge role for the Gauchos, scoring 22 points and grabbing 11 boards against the Titans Saturday night. Edelman notched her third straight double-double in the victory and is averaging a dominant 23.33 points and 11 rebounds over the last three contests.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara held its single-game losing streak for roughly 48 hours, Fullerton was handed its seventh loss in a row. The Titans, at 7-16 overall and 2-8 in conference, are 8th place in Big West standings; however, they’re in a better position than last year when they finished 4-25 overall and just 1-15 in the Big West. Fortunately for Fullerton, the Titans will have a chance at redemption when they visit the Thunderdome Thursday of this week to take on Santa Barbara again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB opened Saturday night’s game with a slow and steady first quarter in which Fullerton was held to only 7 points. While the Titans got on the board first with Daeja Smith layup, Edelman answered with a bucket of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s bucket led to another for the 6’4 forward, then shots by Sarah Bates, Drea Toler, and Aliceah Hernandez fell for a 10-0 run over nearly 8 minutes. With 2:06 to go in the quarter, the Titans finally got a basket, a three, but Edelman again answered to make it 12-5 with 1:11 left.</p>\n<p>After two free throws by the Fullerton’s China Henderson put the Titans within 5, Sarah Bates sunk a three of her own to close out the quarter, UCSB leading 15-7. Shooting 2 of 13 and registering 8 turnovers in the quarter, the Titans had plenty to improve on heading into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Using a 5-0 run to start the quarter, the Titans cut the Santa Barbara lead to 3 before the Gauchos got a bucket from none other than Edelman at the 6:47 mark.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s jumper sparked a 12-0 run by the Gauchos to take a 27-12 lead just under the five-minute mark. With 3:27 to go, Sarah Bates hit her second three of the quarter for the Gauchos’ last score of the half.</p>\n<p>Bates finished the game with 12 points and 5 rebounds to accompany Edelman in double figures for the third straight game. The Titans closed out the quarter behind a Hannah Thompson layup and Triann Thompson jumper, with both teams failing to score in the last 2 and a half minutes of the half.</p>\n<p>Edelman got the second half of play rolling with back to back baskets, giving the Gauchos their largest lead of the game, 36-18. Fullerton answered with an 11-2 run, forcing Santa Barbara to take a timeout at the 4:14 mark as their 18 point lead was diminished to 9.</p>\n<p>Following the timeout, Titan Jade Vega drained a three to make it 38-32, but a three by Hernandez and then Makala Roper with 7 seconds left allowed Santa Barbara to keep a 9-point lead, 47-38, heading into the final ten minutes of play. Hannah Thompson had 8 of her team-high 13 points in the third for Fullerton, while Edelman had 8 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw UCSB go through a scoring drought that lasted over half the quarter before Edelman got a layup to fall with only 4:21 to go. The Titans were busy during Santa Barbara’s dry stretch, putting together a 7-0 run.</p>\n<p>After Edelman’s basket, a Triann Thompson three-ball put the Titans within a single point, down only 49-48 with four minutes left. Roper got UCSB up 51-48 with a layup, but two more jumpers by Fullerton gave the Titans the 52-51 lead with 2:28 remaining, forcing a Gaucho timeout.</p>\n<p>Despite an amazing comeback by the Titans to take the lead, Fullerton failed to score following UCSB’s timeout. The Gauchos closed out the game using yet another Edelman bucket and enough made free throws to pull out the 59-52 victory.</p>\n<p>The exciting finish will make for an interesting rematch on Thursday when UCSB will host the Titans at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/","id":945,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[944,943,942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Come Up Short on the Road; Fall to UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"In Thursday night’s tightly-contested game against UC Riverside, the UCSB women's basketball team was outlasted by the Highlanders, in the end, losing 84-76.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In Thursday night’s tightly-contested game against UC Riverside, the UCSB women’s basketball team was outlasted by the Highlanders, in the end, losing 84-76.

Bates then made another three to with 6:39 left to make it a 9-4 game, which seemed to wake up UC Riverside’s Michelle Curry. Curry scored 11 of her career-high 30 points in the first. Sarah Porter went 3-3 from beyond the arc for 9 of her 12 points on the night.</p>\n<p>Tied at 23 after one, the Gauchos didn’t fare quite as well in the second quarter as they did in the first. After shooting 50 percent from the field and 60 percent from three in the first, Santa Barbara shot just 28.6 percent overall and 20 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, Riverside shot 80 percent overall to outscore them 22-12 in the quarter. A tale of two quarters for UCSB, no Gaucho made more than one field goal as they were held scoreless in the last 3 minutes of the half.</p>\n<p>Curry added 6 points for the Highlanders, while Edelman rested the full 10 minutes. Down 35-45, head coach Bonnie Henrickson had the task of re-centering her team’s efforts during halftime, and it seems she did just that.</p>\n<p>Determined not to roll over so quickly, Santa Barbara gave the Highlanders a taste of their own medicine, outscoring Riverside 20-12 in the quarter to head into the fourth down by only 2. Opening the quarter on a 10-0 run, the Gauchos got big production from Edelman, who scored 10 points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also held Riverside to just 5 of 19 field goals, preventing any Highlander from making more than one shot.

UC Davis dropped to a 16-8 overall, 7-3 conference record and now sits in second place in the Big West, just one game back from Santa Barbara in the conference standings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into this game there was plenty of uncertainty in terms of how these two teams were going to match up. While they both had been battling it out in the Big West conference standings since the beginning of the season, the Gauchos and Aggies hadn’t actually played against each other yet on the court. Even the Davis students were anticipating this one, as the atmosphere at the Pavilion was almost play-off like at the tip-off with about 3,500 people in attendance.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first half was all UCSB however as the Gauchos came out of the gate scorching hot, building up a twenty point lead at one point and ultimately shooting over 60% from three for the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A huge part of SB’s first half dominance was the unselfish yet aggressive mindset that first year Coach Pasternack has imprinted on this team. The first four buckets by the Gauchos were all made by different players and all assisted on, and the ball-movement on offense was creating a lot of holes in a usually stout Aggie defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have seen many times throughout the season that just the threat of the Gaucho’s three point shooting has opened up countless passing and driving lanes, but when they’re actually knocking them down it becomes an almost impossible tasks for opposing defenses to guard them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it was a great team effort, the best player in the half for UCSB had to be Marcus Jackson. The graduate transfer from Rice finished the half with 15 points on 6-8 shooting, and continues to prove how important he is to the facilitation of the offense this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it should come to no surprise that Jackson is able to light up the scoreboard every now and then (he was the 35th player in Rice history to score 1,000 points in his time there), his high basketball IQ and ability to knock down the three adds an entirely new element to this Gaucho team that along with the performance of Leland King II and Max Heidegger so far has created arguably the best trio in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with all that SB was doing great the deficit was only 12 points going into halftime, mostly because of the play of Junior TJ Shorts II. The Aggie guard ultimately finished the game with 28 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds, and was tasked with making sure the lead didn’t get out of hand for most of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even at just 5’9, his quickness and shooting ability definitely puts him up on the short-list of best players in the conference, and he will be a big part of the scouting report for the Gauchos when they take on this team again next week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis actually made a run late in the second half, cutting the lead down to five with a minute to go in the game. Junior guard Siler Schneider broke past the 1,000 point mark with his first shot in the second half, a huge milestone for a player at this level, and scored 10 points in the last frame to keep the Aggies in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were able to hold Davis off thanks in part to the contributions of Junior Jarriesse Blackmon, whose 8 points off the bench in the half could not have came at a better time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Blackmon hasn’t been able to get much going on the offensive end in his time in this season, if performances like this become consistent it would be huge for this team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the Gauchos stay on the road as they get set to take on the other second place team in the Big West, Long Beach State. Although Thursday’s win was big, UCSB knows more than anyone that the season is not close to over, and they’ll have to keep fighting for anything they get.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LBSU at 7 p.m. on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

It’s a streak that includes victories over some of the top teams in the conference, such as Hawaii and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have a chance to take complete control of the Big West Thursday, but they’ll do so away from the friendly walls of the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are 11-0 at home this year, the longest such streak to start a season in school history, but they are just 6-5 on the road.</p>\n<p>Some of that disparity is attributable to the top-25 schools UCSB has played on the road, but an away win over a top Big West competitor would do wonders for the team’s confidence as it heads into the homestretch.</p>\n<p>A rough start to conference play defensively put the Gauchos in a hole early, but they’ve battled back since. No team has scored more than 70 points in regulation against UCSB since their Jan. 13 loss to Hawaii, a major turnaround that has helped propel the team up the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>A strong defense will be especially important against a UC Davis team that’s coming off of a 105-point performance, albeit in double overtime, against Long Beach State on Saturday. The Aggies won that game on a running three-pointer by TJ Shorts II with just two seconds to go. That’s a major high, and one that the Gauchos might be able to take advantage of on the comedown.</p>\n<p>To do so, UCSB will rely heavily on sophomore guard Max Heidegger and graduate transfer Leland King II on offense, just as they have all season. King has been particularly potent as of late, as his double-double average over the Gauchos’ two wins last week earned the forward the honor of Big West Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>King is now averaging 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds on the year and is knocking down about two three-pointers a game at a 42.3 percent clip. That’s almost as good as Heidegger’s 42.4 percent rate from distance, a sparkling percentage that has propelled the sophomore to his team-leading 20.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>The major question mark heading into Thursday’s game is the status of King’s frontcourt mate, Jalen Canty. Canty, who missed Saturday’s game against CSUN due to a suspension for violation of a team rule, is averaging about 13 points and eight rebounds per game. As of Monday night, the team had made no announcement on the senior’s status for Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB isn’t alone in dealing with questions regarding a suspended big man. UCD sent senior forward Chima Moneke home before Saturday’s game in Long Beach and has also made no announcement as to whether or not the big man will play.</p>\n<p>If Moneke is out, that’s a major blow to the Aggies. The 6’6” forward is averaging a team-leading 18.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, and he proved himself on a big stage against Kansas in last year’s NCAA Tournament with 20 points and nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCD proved they could fill in for Moneke’s absence on the scoreboard, but his rebounding will be tougher to replace. No other player on the team is averaging more than four rebounds per game, and it’s likely that 6’3” guard Michael Onyebalu will struggle to replicate his 11-rebound performance from Saturday.</p>\n<p>Without Moneke, the offensive burden would likely fall to junior guards Shorts and Siler Schneider. Both players were successful in doing so against Long Beach, as Shorts put up a team-high 31 points while Schneider was close behind with 27.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether either big man, Canty or Moneke, will play on Saturday, but it’s a question that will have major impacts on the course of the game, and thus on the Big West.</p>\n<p>It’s taken about a month of conference play for these two teams to meet, and they’ll finally do so with very high stakes. Looming suspensions cast a pall over the long-awaited matchup, which will likely be determined by which team can adapt the best and break the deadlock in their favor.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UC Davis at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 8 at The Pavilion.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

How was the transition from college to overseas?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Eric Childress: </strong>Playing in the British Basketball League was pretty difficult. I say this only because I feel like the club I was with had the potential to be very talented, but we underperformed and many different circumstances made it hard for us to reach our potential. The transition from college to overseas, I’d say, can be different for every person depending on the country you land in. For me, going to the U.K., I was very fortunate in going to a place where everyone spoke English and it was the most similar to the U.S. With that being said, if I were to start my career somewhere in Asia, South America or even here in Georgia I think I would have struggled at first because of the language barrier and it being such a big culture shock. It’s hard for me to just maneuver around town like I was in Leeds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Did you get in touch with any former Gauchos who play or have played overseas prior to starting your pro career?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yeah, prior to leaving I talked to players like James Nunally &amp; Orlando Johnson, who came back to Santa Barbara during the summer, and kind of picked their brains about the whole overseas experience. Also, it’s easier for me to get in contact with Alan Williams, Nate Garth, Zalmico Harmon and Michael Bryson, so whenever I have a big question that I feel like I can’t really get on my own I’ll reach out and see if they can offer me some advice from their experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: How did you know at the time that Leeds Force was the right fit for you? Did you have an agent help with that choice?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>I feel like you never really know which team is the right fit until you get there. You kind of watch film of the league and past seasons, but ultimately the guys you see from the last season are likely gone to another country or [have] signed with another team in the league. When I got to Leeds I had no clue what I was getting myself into. We had, of course, your local players for the team, and many imports, as they call us, from different places such as Houston and Florida in the States, then a player for Greece, one from Switzerland, one from Lithuania and one from Germany. So it’s more on the club to make sure our playing styles complement each other when they offer us to play for them. My choice to go play for Leeds was made by my agent and me. We felt like the U.K. was a good starting place for me to go because of the similarities to the U.S., and the British Basketball League (BBL) is a good league with many talented players.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: I see you’re no longer a member of Leeds Force? Was that by choice or was it a matter of both sides just not being able to agree?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>After giving Leeds a shot, the club and I both agreed that things weren’t going in the direction we hoped for and mutually decided to go our separate ways. I wish those guys the best over there for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: You played with guys like Alan “Big Al” Williams, Michael Bryson and more. How often do you stay in touch with them? Do you ever seek advice from them for anything?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>One of the greatest things about UCSB — and I commend Coach Williams for this — was that he brought in some of the best dudes I’ll ever meet. With that being said, I speak to pretty much all my teammates from the past days because of the old group chats that we had in college and are still active in. As far as advice, I try to figure out some stuff on my own. If I can’t get it and [am] really struggling, then I’ll reach out to them or even old high school family such as my coaches and old teammates and see what advice they can offer me in this experience.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Have you had a chance to peep this year’s men’s basketball team? If so, what have your thoughts been especially since the program now has a new head coach in Joe Pasternack?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>This year’s team has been amazing. I’m really happy for those guys that had to go through that tough season last year and [am] juiced for Gabe [Vincent] to be out there performing great after that injury last year. Glad to see Jalen [Canty] and Ami [Lakoju] out there on the floor after their situation last year as well. I can’t even lie: I was jealous, and I told them this when watching them play against Cal State Fullerton this year. Their play style differs so much from ours last year that it really seems like those dudes that are on the floor are genuinely having fun with the game, and I feel like the most important [thing] is having fun while competing at a high level. I’m happy they adjusted to Coach P’s system so quickly, and I think he did an outstanding job with those guys with getting them to compete on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: What’s next for Eric Childress? I see you’ve recently announced your signing with a team in the country of Georgia; what convinced you to do so?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yes, I recently signed to play and finish my rookie year here in Batumi, Georgia with BC Batumi. The biggest thing was that I didn’t want what happened in Leeds to affect my love for the game. I’ve been playing and giving my all to this sport for as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a professional basketball player. That was the biggest choice in deciding to come here and continue on. What also factored in was realizing that I get to travel the world, see many different places and cultures, try different things and gain new experiences that many people aren’t fortunate [enough] to do, so I’m blessed to even have this opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Any good or unfamiliar meals overseas that you liked or disliked?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>As for as meals go, I’m one of the pickiest eaters you’ll ever meet. Shout-out to my mom and pops for teaching me how to cook. I feel like one day I’ll venture out and try something new, but if it doesn’t pass the smell test, I don’t think it’s for me.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb.

However, they then went on to win five in a row.</p>\n<p>UCSB has shown resilience and the ability to heat up, two very useful attributes as the second half of the season progresses. As per usual, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson is focusing on what’s to come and how to improve.</p>\n<p>In preparation for Thursday’s contest against Riverside, Henrickson stressed the unique nature of the Highlanders’ offense and how her team will defend it.</p>\n<p>“Riverside is a lot of five-out motion, cuts, slips, curls, guards posting. It’s a lot of difference. It’s a very different style than anyone else in the league, so it’s been trying to get comfortable with how we’re going to play it,” Henrickson said. “We need to minimize the number of catches in those spots by their players because it’s their motion and movement but players have tendencies. It’s a little bit of recognizing who am I guarding and what does my guy like to do.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Riverside’s offense has taken its toll on teams this season through exploiting mismatches.</p>\n<p>“They’re pretty balanced, so they bring some mismatch problems for us,” Henrickson said. “Their guards are going to post, which we don’t see a lot.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Henrickson, the Gauchos have plenty of options at the guard position and can continue to lean on their freshman point guard Sarah Bates as senior guard Drea Toler works toward returning to 100 percent.</p>\n<p>Bates leads Santa Barbara in scoring during conference play, averaging 14.6 points per game, but she’s not just finding the net. Also leading the Gauchos in the assist category, Bates has dished out an average of 3.1 dimes per game in conference matchups.</p>\n<p>Looking closer at Riverside, the Highlanders have fallen in their last four games, so they’re likely eager to get back on track. UCSB’s last meeting with Riverside was in last season’s Big West Quarterfinals, where the Gauchos won 81-71 to advance.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against Riverside, Santa Barbara will turn around to visit CSU Fullerton on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Similar to Riverside, the Titans are in a rut of their own, having lost five in a row. Despite Fullerton’s recent struggles, Henrickson again understands that records aren’t everything.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got good size inside,” Henrickson said. “Good shooters, good athletes.

When it finally did, it did so in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rode a 19-1 run over seven minutes in the second half to a 75-51 victory over the Matadors, pushing UCSB to 18-5 this season and 7-2 in the Big West. The win was also the Gauchos’ 11<sup>th</sup> home victory in a row to open the year, the best home start in school history.</p>\n<p>“When Coach (Pasternak) came in, he wanted to establish the Thunderdome as a good home court,” sophomore guard Max Heidegger said. “Hopefully the years will pass and even after we’re gone it’ll still be rocking.

UCSB and CSUN traded baskets and stops throughout the first half, which saw six lead changes, and neither team was able to get much going offensively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot just 42 percent from the field, and 20 percent from three, in the first 20 minutes. CSUN was even less effective, shooting 31 percent on field goals, a testament to both UCSB’s defense as well as the Matadors’ general inability to put the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s saving grace in that cold first half was their rebounding, which was something of a surprise considering standout big man Jalen Canty’s absence Saturday night due to an indefinite suspension for a violation of team rules. Even without the 6-8 forward averaging 7.8 rebounds per game, the Gauchos were able to turn their 10 first half offensive rebounds into 10 second-chance points.</p>\n<p>While CSUN’s shooting problems persisted into the second half, UCSB seemed to find a way to shoot through their problems. The Gauchos rebounded in the last 20 minutes by going 50 percent from the field and 55 percent from three-point land, a major catalyst in their 43-point second half explosion.</p>\n<p>“Guys just started hitting shots,” Heidegger said. “[…] We were getting the same quality shots all game, but there was a stretch there when they all just started going down, so that helped us increase the lead.”</p>\n<p>Another major catalyst was graduate transfer Leland King II. Playing without his usual frontcourt mate Canty, King was dominant Saturday night with 25 points, tied for his season-high, and 17 rebounds, his season-best outright.</p>\n<p>“The greatest rebounder I ever coached was Leon Powe at Cal […] and to me Leland’s a better rebounder than him,” Pasternak said. “[Powe] played for the Boston Celtics. Leland’s ranked number 12<sup>th</sup> in the country in rebounding […] To me, rebounding translates to the next level. I think he’s a pro, and he showed it tonight.”</p>\n<p>King controlled the game from the start, with a 10 point, 13 rebound double-double in the just the first half, but really turned on the offensive jets in the last 20 minutes. It was King that kickstarted UCSB’s game-sealing run with two straight buckets, including a running hook with 9:52 to go that pushed the forward past 1,000 points in his career.</p>\n<p>Ami Lakoju was Canty’s replacement as King’s partner in the starting frontcourt, and the 6-8 junior filled in admirably with 10 points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes. It was Lakoju who built on King’s two baskets by outmuscling two CSUN defenders and jamming a putback dunk in over their heads, pushing UCSB’s lead to 12 and electrifying the Thunderdome crowd.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game was particularly special to Lakoju, who was playing in front of his father for just the second time in his college career. The elder Lakoju, a minister and family counselor from Harlem, made the long trip to see his son play, an important boost for the junior.</p>\n<p>“It was a blessing to see him here,” Lakoju said. “He kind of surprised me with that visit but nonetheless I’m happy to see him here and for him to see us get two wins.</p>\n<p>Point guard Marcus Jackson followed up Lakoju’s dunk with two straight jumpers to stretch the lead to 16 points. Jackson, who has struggled with his shot recently, put up 12 points in the second half alone, an important development for the graduate transfer.</p>\n<p>“Marcus has been in kind of a shooting funk, and I wanted to give him some confidence,” Pasternak said. “[…] Sometimes it becomes mind over matter, so I wanted him to shoot. I started calling plays for him to get his confidence going. He hit a couple of shots and hopefully that’ll carry over.”</p>\n<p>Jackson had perhaps the team’s most balanced stat line of the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists. It was his corner three with 3:48 remaining that put the Gauchos up 68-44 and prompted Pasternak to begin emptying the UCSB bench.</p>\n<p>Playing without Canty, the Gauchos went to their bench earlier and more often than usual. Jarriesse Blackmon played 18 high-energy minutes, going 4-7 for eight points and six rebounds, while Christian Terrell dished out six assists without turning the ball over once in his 24 minutes.</p>\n<p>“I thought Jarriesse Blackmon gave us incredible energy,” Pasternak said. “To get that kind of contribution from him off the bench was really big for us.”</p>\n<p>The strong bench performances allowed Pasternak and his staff to give several starters lighter loads on Saturday. Gabe Vincent played just five minutes in the second half in order to rest a sore calf, and Max Heidegger was able to give his sore back a little bit more of a rest than it got in Thursday’s overtime marathon against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Whatever rest the Gauchos got on Saturday will be especially important come Thursday night, when UCSB travels to UC Davis to play for Big West supremacy.

After opening Big West play 3-0, the Gauchos are fifth in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>While UCSB snapped its two-game losing streak on Saturday, Hawaii has now lost its last two games and lands it in last place of the Big West. Hawaii is now 9-14 overall and 2-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a much-improved shooting effort. The Gauchos were determined to get the ball inside to Edelman early, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter alone, Edelman had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Hawaii’s offense seemed a bit disjointed in the first quarter of play, but a diversified scoring effort from five different players allowed the Rainbow Wahine to keep within a possession after one quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Up 19-16 to start the second quarter, UCSB kept its foot on the gas, opening with an 8-0 run. The run was led by none other than Edelman, who had 8 in the quarter, and Chaya Durr. After shooting 57.1 percent in the first, Santa Barbara went on to shoot an even better 60 percent in the second.</p>\n<p>But, the Gauchos weren’t only scoring efficiently, they held Hawaii scoreless for nearly five minutes as they constructed their run. Despite shooting 3-for-10 in the quarter, Hawaii used those three buckets to go on a 6-0 run in the last two minutes. The run placed Hawaii within a manageable 8-point deficit, but Edelman sunk two free throws at the end of the first half to go up 10 again, 34-24.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke about her team’s performance in the second quarter, in which the Gauchos held Hawaii to only eight points.</p>\n<p>“I thought defensively, we were disruptive and forced turnovers and then scored off those turnovers,” she explained. “We were aggressive in passing lanes, we got on the floor for loose balls.”</p>\n<p>Consistency has been an issue for UCSB this season, but the Gauchos entered the third quarter with a sense of focus and determination to keep rolling.</p>\n<p>A barrage of three-pointers from Akilah Jennings, Sarah Bates, and Sarah Porter capped a 15-5 stretch for the Gauchos, going up 49-29 at the 5:07 mark. Down 20, the Rainbow Wahine, led by Sarah Toeaina, needed to make something happen.</p>\n<p>Toeaina got a pair of free throws to fall and shortly after made a layup in traffic for 4 points in 40 seconds to cap an 8-0 run, but the Gauchos stayed up 56-40 at the end of the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final quarter of play up 16, Santa Barbara looked to be in control, but the Gauchos’ shooting struggles resurfaced as they made only three field goals in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, Toeaina exploded for 13 points in the quarter as part of Hawaii’s continued comeback effort. From their 8-0 run to end the third, the Rainbow Wahine kept attacking in order to outscore the Gauchos 21-15 in the fourth. Toeaina, who struggled to get going early in the game, finished with 25 points.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Hawaii, its impressive comeback effort consisting of a 24-7 run was not enough, despite getting within 6. With only 30 seconds to go, Hawaii was forced to foul, sending Bates to the line. Bates, who finished with 13 points to accompany Edelman in double-digit scoring, confidently knocked down both.

UCSB has now dropped to the 5<sup>th</sup> seed in the Big West, being edged out by their opponents – the Matadors are now the lone fourth seed in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t seem to buy a bucket, as they only shot a subpar 20.3 percent from the field. CSUN was only slightly above their opponents, shooting at 27.8 percent on the night.</p>\n<p>The game started off looking promising, as redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman notched the first 4 points in the game, sinking in two baskets. However, those would be the last points the Gauchos would score for the remainder of that quarter.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their anemic offense, the game didn’t look like it would run away from the home team, as the visitors only managed to put up 9 points on the board in the first period.</p>\n<p>The second quarter showed a bright spot for the Gauchos. They went on much needed 7-0 run sparked by sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez – Santa Barbara was trailing 14-4 prior to the offensive explosion.</p>\n<p>After the 2 points by Hernandez, freshman combo guard/forward Nina Radford splashed a 3-pointer and senior guard Makala Roper swished in a layup. The run narrowed the deficit gap, the home team then only down by 3.</p>\n<p>The rest of the game was more of the same for UCSB, as their offensive struggles continued.</p>\n<p>The score was 22-13 at the half, the visiting Matadors holding the lead.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Gauchos was thriving, getting stop after stop, and making it extremely difficult for their opponents to get any offensive flow going.</p>\n<p>Despite the superb defense, though, it was all for naught. Santa Barbara could not manage to get themselves into any offensive rhythm of some sort.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge was held to just 26 points after the half, showcasing UCSB’s stellar defense. However, the home team was trailing at the half and could not manage to pick up the pace and nix the deficit they were buried in, as they only were able to put up 17 points in the second half of the game.</p>\n<p>The road team ended the night on 15-for-54 shooting, while Santa Barbara had a 13-for-64 shooting night.</p>\n<p>Both teams were poor offensively, but they both also brought elite defenses to the game as well.</p>\n<p>The turnovers for both teams were less than ideal, CSUN having 15 and the home team giving away 13.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s bench outplayed their opponents, once again. UCSB’s bench contributed 16 points, compared to the Matador’s bench that only added 11.</p>\n<p>The leading scorer for the Gauchos was redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar, who scored 5 for the home team. Junior center Channon Fluker gave her team a boost with 15 points and was the leading scorer for CSUN.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara looks to bounce back from this loss as they look ahead to go against Hawaii on Saturday, February 3 at 2pm at home once again in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80844\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80844\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/","id":896,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[895,894,893],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
