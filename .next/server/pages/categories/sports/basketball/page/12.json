Each run the Gauchos made with their best weapons on the court was undone when they went to the bench, and ultimately they weren’t able to make a full comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys for Coach Pasternack going into Thursday night and, for the rest of the season, will be getting more from his bench and finding a way to make sure that the stars aren’t too worn down going into the postseason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key for UCSB will be staying perfect at home this year, which they have managed to do for a while sporting a 9-0 record at the Thunderdome so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are one win away from matching their best ever home start which was 10-0 done by the 1989-90 squad, which is a complete turnaround from their 5-8 home record last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack talked about the importance of building a strong home base in the beginning of the season, and the team’s great performances so far have given the UCSB community a lot to be excited about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendance has been great as of late, and if the Gauchos can continue their dominance we may be seeing an even bigger cultural shift on campus in terms of regaining pride in SB as a basketball school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple players to watch for on Hawaii are redshirt freshman guard Drew Buggs and senior forward Mike Thomas. Buggs is a quick yet high IQ guard that leads the Rainbow Warriors in both assists (3.8 per game) and steals (1.6). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he only scored nine points last time these teams met, he is a big part of the offensive gameplan for Hawaii, so it will be important for the Gauchos to limit him as a distributor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas is a much more straightforward down-low player, yet has shown how efficient he can be a scorer. He scores more per game than any other player on Hawaii averaging 11.3 points per contest, yet doesn’t take the most shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His battle with Jalen Canty and Leland King down on the boards will be pivotal to how much success the Rainbow Warriors have on offense, and he will also have to play a huge role in producing on the offensive end for Hawaii as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have a lot riding on this game, and they’re aware that a chance to move up to first in the Big West and tie the best home start to the season ever doesn’t come around too often. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors know that they can compete with UCSB, and won’t go down easy, but it’s going to be up to the Gauchos to use their talent and the home crowd to come out with a win.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, February 1st at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The game ended up being tied at the end of each quarter until UCSB edged out their opponents by one point in the final period of regulation.</p>\n<p>In considering the last 5 meetings between these two teams, the Gauchos have a slight advantage – having to beat the Matadors 3 out of the last 5 games.</p>\n<p>In order to come out on top, Santa Barbara will have to have another strong offensive game. And if they want to win convincingly, they must be sure to keep their opponents’ firepower at bay, otherwise, it’s going to be another tough one down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Players for the Gauchos to look out for, are the two leading scorers for the Matadors – junior center Channon Fluker and junior forward Tessa Boagni, who have both been on an explosive tangent this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 20.9 and 11.9 points per game respectively, Fluker and Boagni are forced to be reckoned with on the court, as their potent offense has the potential to put extreme pressure on the defensive approach of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Last time these opponents faced off, they both hovered around 40% shooting for the game, but it will be crucial for one team to edge out the other in the offensive tug-of-war, just as UCSB previously did on the road in the fourth quarter, to solidify the win against the home team Matadors.</p>\n<p>Both teams had great rebounding in their previous meeting, with Cal State Northridge having the very slight advantage in that category.</p>\n<p>One category the Matadors dominated their opponents in during the last meeting, pointed in the paint.</p>\n<p>During the last game, Cal State Northridge won the high percentage shot battle, by having an impressive 48 points scored in the paint, to Santa Barbara’s less than half 22 points in the same category.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly both teams will need to put more concentration into their fourth-quarter play, as that was the detriment of both teams in their most recent losses to their opponents.</p>\n<p>Producing points in clutch time will be key if both teams score as consistently against each other as they did in the past.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a spectacular game last time UCSB went toe-to-toe with Cal State Northridge, contributing a double-double consisting of 23 points and 5 assists.

History seemed to repeat itself, as that was again the same story.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was heated, with both teams going blow for blow. In a quarter that was a fast-paced battle consisting of back-and-forth basketball, neither team led by more than four points.</p>\n<p>Looking at the scoreboard, it was 45-44 after the third – UCSB clinging on to their one-point advantage going into the last quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>The visitors opened their last quarter with a subpar performance, scoring just three points over the first seven minutes. During that same time, UC Davis outscored their opponents 15-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos attempted to stomp their way back into the game to get the win, but ultimately their attempt was futile. The Aggies outscored UCSB 25-18 in the last quarter of regulation, solidifying their second win against Santa Barbara in just a few days.</p>\n<p>UCSB Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a monster game, leading all scorers with 25 points – equaling her career-high. Bates was on fire from long range, draining seven of twelve from downtown.</p>\n<p>The only other players scoring double digits for the visiting Gauchos were redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman who scored 13 points, and senior guard Makala Roper who notched 12 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman had her fifth double-double of the season, seasoning 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points. And Roper’s 12 points were scored as she came off the bench, and she impressively went four of five from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos who scored in double digits were seemingly the only gleaming spot for the visiting team, as the rest of the team went only went 4 for 27 from the field.

The 6’4 forward shot 10-of-13 from the field and went a perfect 3-3 from the free-throw line, her fifth game this season being perfect from the line.</p>\n<p>As Edelman continues to control the paint with an average of 14.7 points per game and 9.2 rebounds per game, guard Sarah Bates has kept up her stellar performance, which is especially impressive for a freshman.</p>\n<p>Bates is Santa Barbara’s second-leading scorer behind Edelman with 10.6 PPG and is also the most efficient shooter from three-point range in the conference shooting 44.7 percent.</p>\n<p>In the win over LBSU, the freshman guard went 6-9 from behind the arc for her career high in three pointers made.</p>\n<p>Also second on the UCSB roster in minutes played with 27.1 minutes, Bates has been an impact player both during the regular season and in Big West play.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos hope to end UC Davis’ five-game winning streak, they’ll have to get better performances than their last meeting with the Aggies from the rest of their roster.</p>\n<p>In their first matchup played just one week ago, UC Davis visited the Thunderdome and came away with the victory in large part due to holding Edelman to only six field goals.</p>\n<p>Plaguing the Gauchos on that night was their shooting. Ending the game shooting 33.9 percent overall and 25 percent from three, UCSB will certainly aim to find the net more efficiently Saturday in Davis.</p>\n<p>Only losing by a close seven points, Santa Barbara has a feasible chance to redeem itself, but the Aggies have some weapons of their own.</p>\n<p>Averaging 19.4 points per game this season, redshirt junior Morgan Bertsch has been part of the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>Bertsch, a 6’4 forward, has led Davis in scoring in 15 games this season and produced a 16-point and 10-rebound double-double in the last meeting with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling at the beginning of the night against the Gauchos, Bertsch was a key cog in helping UC Davis seal the win scoring six points, collecting three rebounds and assisting on two baskets in the fourth quarter of the match.</p>\n<p>Also hurting the Gauchos in that game was Aggie Pele Gianotti, who scored 15 points despite missing all six of her three point attempts.</p>\n<p>Gianotti, a senior forward, is averaging 10.1 points per contest and leads her team in rebounding, averaging 5.8 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to make the necessary defensive adjustments against Davis in order to limit Gianotti’s and Bertsch’s production, but the Aggies will undoubtedly be ready to compete in the clash of the top-two Big West teams.</p>\n<p>Just one year ago, UCSB was the team that upset UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Semifinal.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have not forgotten that, and a regular season sweep of the Gauchos will be a good token of revenge. UCSB will take on UC Davis at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 27, at The Pavilion in Davis, CA.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily

UCSB has a better overall record at 14-5, but two blown leads have set them back a little bit in the Big West, where their 3-2 record is good for fourth place.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB also comes into the game ranked No. 17 in the most recent Collegeinsider.com Mid-Major Poll. The Titans received three votes but ultimately couldn’t join the Gauchos as the only other Big West team on the list.</p>\n<p>The Titans come into the matchup with a 6-1 home record, which is second in the conference only to UCSB’s perfect 9-0 start to the year.</p>\n<p>One of the keys for the Gauchos will be limiting Fullerton’s transition offense and momentum in general in order to keep the crowd out of the game. UCSB hasn’t done a great job of imposing itself as a threat on the road so far, as the team is currently 4-5, but a solid win against a top two team in the conference would go a long way in making that happen.</p>\n<p>One reason why the Gauchos were successful in the last meeting between these teams was the offensive versatility of the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>While the two usual offensive stalwarts, sophomore guard Max Heidegger and graduate forward Leland King II, had a great game combining for 41 points, it was the double digit production from other players that pushed UCSB over the top.</p>\n<p>Graduate guard Marcus Jackson had a season-high 19 points, and both senior guard Gabe Vincent and senior forward Jalen Canty ended with double digits to round out the starting five.</p>\n<p>By diversifying their offensive attack, the Gauchos were able to spread out and overwhelm the Titans’ defense, which is what led to an early 15-point lead and the eventual 19-point blowout.</p>\n<p>Fullerton will be looking to take advantage of the scoring ability of their bench to close the gaps between these two teams.</p>\n<p>In the last matchup between these teams, the Titans bench outscored the Santa Barbara bench 17-2, and — as far as conventional basketball knowledge says — key players perform better at home than they do on the road.</p>\n<p>While part of the discrepancy between bench scoring had to do with some garbage time scoring by Fullerton, the Gauchos have a real problem producing on offense when the starting five isn’t in, as they have shown with their two blown 20-point leads.</p>\n<p>While these problems with offense for the bench won’t be solved overnight, they just make it that much more important for the Gauchos’ reserves to continue to play hard and smart on defense.</p>\n<p>Two players to keep an eye out for on the Titans are guards Kyle Allman, Jr. and Khalil Ahmad.</p>\n<p>The juniors make up one of the highest-scoring tandems in the Big West, with a combined 33.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played good defense on them in the last game, holding them .5 points below their collective average; however, containing them a second time will be much harder, especially at Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a big game for UCSB in terms of standings.</p>\n<p>A win will push the Gauchos up to second place and in direct contention with first place Hawaii, who they play next week.</p>\n<p>Because of early-season miscues, there is a must-win mentality in this squad that trickles down from the high expectations set by Coach Pasternack and his staff.</p>\n<p>All the players have to do is get out there and execute, which they’ve done a good job of so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against CSUF at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 25 at Titan Gym in Fullerton, CA.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":li\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" aria-label=\"Show trimmed content\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018</em><em>, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

However, UC Davis would bounce back with two baskets before the end of the quarter to only go down three points heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Aggies then took their first lead of the night following a 4-0 run to begin the second to take the lead at 16-15 before Tal Sahar nailed a three to put the Gauchos back on top.</p>\n<p>After that however, it was all UC Davis who used a 16-6 run until the end of the second to take a 32-24 lead into the break. In the first quarter, the Gauchos had redshirt Morgan Bertsch held to zero points, but the Aggies star came alive in the second scoring eight points to help give her team the eight-point lead heading into the break.</p>\n<p>The third quarter began with UCSB and UC Davis trading buckets. With around four minutes remaining in the third, and UCSB down four, the Gauchos put together an 8-0 run to take a 48-43 lead. Like the first, the Aggies scored the final four points of the quarter to go down by just one heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Much like the second, in the final frame, Santa Barbara just could not buy a basket. After a make by senior guard Drea Toler which made the score 50-47 with 8:04 on the clock, UC Davis scored the next 12 points, fueled by a pair of three-pointers from junior guard Karley Eaton, to go up 59-50.</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to fight back with three points from freshman guard Sarah Bates and Toler but UC Davis was great from the charity stripe down the stretch, sealing the Gauchos fate as they lost 68-61 at the final buzzer.</p>\n<p>Neither team shot the three-ball particularly well, with the Gauchos hitting on just 25 percent (7-for-28) while the Aggies went 4-for-23 (17.4 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, UC Davis went 26-for-58 (44.8 percent) from the field compared to a 33.9 percent (21-for-62) shooting night for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bertsch, despite shooting under her season average, still tallied a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds and was a huge factor down the strech.</p>\n<p>Following two straight losses, albeit competitive ones, the Gauchos now know they need to make some quick fixes if they dont want to fall into a deep losing streak like they did earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the return of a guard like Toler could provide the offense a much needed passing boost. She finished with a team-high 15 points in her home debut.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action on Saturday against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

thus far.</p>\n<p>In their two Big West losses this season, UCSB has lost by a combined two points with both games being away from home at Cal Poly and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>That being said, the Gauchos will hope to improve and make the tournament this year as opposed to last year, which saw them miss the Big West Tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason for Santa Barbara’s turnaround has been the addition of graduate transfer forward Leland King II and the emergence of sophomore guard Max Heidegger.</p>\n<p>King II has helped the Gauchos on both ends of the floor, and he is a near shoe-in to win Big West Newcomer of the Year.</p>\n<p>He currently averages a double-double with 16.7 points per game, fourth-best mark in the conference and 10.2 rebounds per contest, the best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, the most shocking transformation has been that of Heidegger, who has completely transformed his game to become one of the most dangerous scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The sophomore currently leads the league in points per game with 21.6 and is lethal from beyond-the-arc, shooting 44.4 percent.</p>\n<p>The team’s quick turnaround also has a lot to do with new Head Coach Joe Pasternack who, in his first season, has already broken the best start by a rookie coach in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is no doubt that the Gauchos are the biggest surprise in the Big West this season, but the key will be if they can continue this in Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UCI at 9 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome, where the Gauchos are still undefeated.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State 49ers by Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>It has been nearly six years since the Long Beach State men’s basketball program won its last Big West Tournament title. The 49ers were winners of the 2012 conference tournament — their last conference title — and nearly pulled off an upset over No. 1 seeded Hawaii in the 2016 Big West championship game before ending their season with an NIT first round loss.</p>\n<p>Since its NIT appearance, the Beach has seesawed between being in the middle of the pack to a potential top-tier team within the Big West.</p>\n<p>The NIT and near NCAA tournament appearances certainly influenced the 49ers’ decision to boost last season’s strength of schedule as they began their non-conference slate against elite programs such as Wichita State, North Carolina, Louisville, UCLA and Washington. Unfortunately, this got the best of them as they lost all five games straight, which then extended to nine games prior to their first win of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>Now in the beginning stages of its 2017-18 Big West conference campaign, Long Beach State is currently in third place after a 84-75 loss to UC Davis on Wednesday, and are now 9-12 overall, 3-2 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s tough schedule backfiring, LBSU remained committed to challenging itself with games against premier non-conference opponents such as Arizona, Michigan State and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>Despite losing each game, senior forward Gabe Levin has been still managing to produce on the 49ers’ end. He leads LBSU in scoring and rebounds and is tied for the lead in steals with averages of 16.3 points, 7.2 rebounds per game and 22 steals. With just 8-of-30 three-pointers made on the season, it is evident that Levin is a dominant force for the 49ers in the paint and interior areas. Junior guard Bryan Alberts is the team’s second leading scorer at 14 PPG.</p>\n<p>LBSU will host Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m. and will be nationally televised by <em>FoxSportsWest</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly Mustangs by Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Junior point guard Donovan Fields carried the ball up the floor with less than a minute left in a Nov. 18 game at Santa Clara University in a pivotal moment in which his team needed a bucket to break the 59-59 tie.</p>\n<p>Fields’ 21 point effort was vital in keeping the Mustangs in the game all night, and it was the team looking at him again with just seconds on the clock.</p>\n<p>The junior answered the call and pulled up with 18 seconds left only to bury a jumper, giving the Mustangs the lead and the win.</p>\n<p>Much like that night against the Broncos, Fields has played a significant role for the Mustangs’ offense all season.</p>\n<p>The point guard leads the team in assists with 63, and his 13.2 points per game is good for second highest on the team this season.</p>\n<p>Senior Victor Joseph’s 13.8 points per game leads the team, and he is among one of the four players who have scored 100+ points so far this season, along with Fields, Jakub Niziol and Luke Meikle.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is off to yet another tough start. The Mustangs sit at 6-11 and 1-2 in Big West play. The team lost seven players from last year’s squad and despite filling a majority of those roster spots, the Mustangs still find themselves playing catch-up in this early part of the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off an underwhelming December, in which the team lost five of its seven games and is hoping to bounce back.</p>\n<p>Thus far, January hasn’t been too friendly either.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost their last two consecutive conference games to CSUF and Hawaii following their conference-opener victory over UCSB that was decided at the free-throw line after a controversial foul call.</p>\n<p>Earning some wins is the next objective for the Mustangs, who went 6-10 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly Mustangs play at UC Irvine Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m. on <em>ESPN3</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge Matadors by Kendra Jackson</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge Matadors currently possess a 4-14 overall record and sit at 1-3 in conference play, and earned its most recent win with a 66-57 victory over UCR Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Matadors ended with an 11-19 overall record and stood at 7-9 within Big West conference play, which clinched the No. 6 seed for them in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Northridge is a balanced team as far as its roster, having nine underclassmen and eight upperclassmen. Their struggles have become apparent as their only wins have been sporadic and have only been achieved on their home court.</p>\n<p>In comparing the current season status of the Matadors to that of last season, the differences are evident. In the 2016-2017 season, CSUN was 7-7 at home, but managed to win some away games, with a 4-8 away record.</p>\n<p>Their biggest streak was a losing streak of six, which all came towards the winding down point of the season, with their last game being a loss versus the team that would eventually eliminate them from championship contention, CSUF.</p>\n<p>Northridge opened up their season in November with a win against Life Pacific, but shortly after endured a run of eight losses in non-conference play.</p>\n<p>The Matadors now stand as the eighth seed, sitting only in front of UC Riverside, who is 5-14 overall and 0-5 within the Big West. CSUN is due to host Cal Poly on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine Anteaters by Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of last year’s impressive 12-4 Big West record that earned it the bragging rights of being the Big West’s regular season conference champion, the UCI men’s basketball team will look to establish consistency and make a redeeming return to the Big West Tournament Finals. However, it had a tough non-conference slate, which has contibuted to its current overall record of 7-13, while thus far the Anteaters have split their Big West conference matchups by a record of 2-2.</p>\n<p>After coming up just short in its 50-47 loss to UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Finals, UC Irvine has been in reflection mode as it prepares for perhaps another championship run. Big West Coach of the Year, Russell Turner, will once again work with his junior forward Jonathan Galloway, who placed second in the conference in rebounds per game. They will try to inspire a fresh new team that consists of almost three-fourths underclassmen.</p>\n<p>Following their most recent 71-54 victory on the road against the CSUN Matadors, the Anteaters’ current .500 win percentage has them sitting exactly at mid table in the Big West Men’s Basketball standings.</p>\n<p>Although they have had their fair share of close games, an indicator of UC Irvine’s early struggles can be found in their scoring differentials. As of late, the Anteaters have averaged 70.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, their opponents have tallied an average of 71.1 points per game. UC Irvine has also averaged a total of 15.3 turnovers each game, a staggering amount compared to its 10.8 forced turnovers average.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host the UC Irvine men’s basketball team this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii Rainbow Warriors by Brandon Victor</strong></p>\n<p>Just two years removed from upsetting Cal during the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Rainbow Warriors (12-5, 3-1) will look to improve upon last year, in which the team finished fifth in the Big West with an 8-8 conference record (14-16 overall).</p>\n<p>Despite being picked to once again finish fifth in the Big West and losing last season’s leading scorer in former star guard/forward Noah Allen, the Rainbow Warriors have implemented a balanced attack on the offensive end that has enabled them to average 73 points a game.</p>\n<p>“Our team strength is probably our balance,” Head Coach Eran Ganot said. “We have different guys who can step up and score for us on any given night. We play inside-out, play as a team and we share the ball really well.”</p>\n<p>While its 9-4 non-conf. start was encouraging, Hawaii was beating up on lesser competition. Against stronger opponents, the Rainbow Warriors have looked outmatched, losing by 13 to Nevada, 18 to Miami, 20 to Utah and 14 to Princeton.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we need to find consistency,” Ganot said.  “We’ve shown flashes, from a game-to-game basis and within games. I’m not sure if we’ve put together a complete game this year. We need to find an ability to find a consistent level.”</p>\n<p>Another potential concern heading into conference play is Hawaii’s lack of true road games. Hawaii split their first two conference games on the road, losing to Long Beach by eight before drubbing CSUN by 19.</p>\n<p>But Hawaii has always been dominant at home, and if it can even split their road games, the Rainbow Warriors are likely to finish near the top of the conference this season. Hawaii takes on UC Davis at home on Saturday, Jan. 20th at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis Aggies by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Last season was a dream come true for the UC Davis men’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>After putting up a tremendous effort in the regular season, the team finished with a 23-13 overall mark and an 11-5 conference record. They then made program history, winning their first Big West Tournament title and an NCAA playoff match before having their historical run end against top-seeded Kansas.</p>\n<p>The player behind that historical run is Chima Moneke. He was a force to be reckoned with, averaging 14.6 points per game and 9.5 rebounds. Moneke earned Big West Newcomer of the Year honors as well as an All-Big West First Team nod.</p>\n<p>Moneke was the guy everyone was going to have their eye on, and it’s safe to say he has not disappointed.</p>\n<p>The senior forward has had an excellent season averaging 19.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest, both second-best marks in the Big West. He has been the biggest force in helping the Aggies reach an 11-6 overall mark and 2-1 conference record so far this season.</p>\n<p>Also, the brighter the stage, the bigger Moneke shines and stands out, allowing for his team to continue thriving and relying on their senior captain. In a game against Pac-12 opponent Washington State, Moneke finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds to lead UC Davis to the victory.</p>\n<p>Even with being picked to finish second in the conference by the media, there is no doubt that the Aggies will be tough to beat and will be on everyone’s mind come tournament time.</p>\n<p>UC Davis continues its run in Big West play against Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 20.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside Highlanders by Andrew Bishop</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders entered their 2017-18 season hoping to bounce back from a disappointing 2016-17 campaign that culminated in a record of 7-21. The Highlanders had a hot start, going 3-0 during a brief tour in Quebec, and upsetting Pac-12 powerhouse UC Berkeley on the road.</p>\n<p>Despite early successes, the remainder of the Highlanders’ season has been nothing short of turbulent. The Highlanders entered conference play with a record of 5-9, and shortly after, parted ways with their head coach of 5 years, Dennis Cutts. They are now 5-13 overall and remain winless in conference play at 0-4.</p>\n<p>Cutts went 50-87 at the helm of UC Riverside’s men’s basketball team, and was succeeded by Associate Head Coach Justin Bell, who will serve as the team’s interim head coach until a replacement is hired. Bell, a UC Riverside alumnus, has struggled to lead his team to victory in all of their four conference games, putting the Highlanders at 0-4 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Throughout the season, the Highlanders have distributed their point production somewhat evenly amongst their starters. Sophomore guard Dikymbe Martin has emerged as the team’s leader in scoring, averaging 13.1 points per game. The Highlanders have also relied heavily on their veteran players on offense, with redshirt senior guard Chance Murray and senior forward Alex Larsson averaging 10.8 and 10.6 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders have boasted solid performances from a few key players, it is clear that it will take more for them to be successful in the Big West. Bell and his players will look for their first conference win against UC Irvine next Wednesday, Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

season. Four games in, it looks like Santa Barbara is on the right track.</p>\n<p>Heading into conference play last season featured Santa Barbara sitting at 5-8; however, the Gauchos came alive in Big West play, going 9-7 and improving to 16-16 overall to close out the season at .500.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to compete against Long Beach State in the Big West Championship, falling just short of the 49ers.</p>\n<p>While there have certainly been rough patches through Santa Barbara’s 2017-2018 campaign thus far, the Gauchos have demonstrated continual improvement. Improvement that, if continued, will perhaps carry Santa Barbara to another successful run in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m process-oriented, I’m not result oriented. If you focus on just a result, you’re not going to address the process element of the result. So for us, continuing to grow stretches where we play well and execute and we have the effort and the energy and the attention to detail it takes to be successful,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>“Then shrink the stretches of the opposite of that where we’ve not been disciplined, we’ve not been dialed in and not brought energy.”</p>\n<p>While turnovers remain a frustrating stat for UCSB, the Gauchos are finding ways to win. In their victory over New Mexico State, the Gauchos turned the ball over 22 times in spite of winning by 30 points. In the close win against rival Cal Poly, UCSB committed 33 turnovers. Santa Barbara’s averaging 17.8 turnovers per game this season, but 19.3 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite turnover woes, the Gauchos have been finding their rhythm offensively as they work the ball inside to redshirt senior Drew Edelman more effectively.</p>\n<p>Edelman is having an even better year than last season and that’s with her early battles with various injuries.</p>\n<p>The 6’4 forward is posting a statline of 14.3 points per game, which is almost four more points than she averaged last season, to go along with 9.4 boards.</p>\n<p>When simply looking at Santa Barbara’s results this season, it may be easy to dismiss the Gauchos in favor of Big West teams with better records.</p>\n<p>But, it is the constant adjustment as well as overall improvement that carries a team through a season, which Henrickson understands.</p>\n<p>“Good players and good teams find success and get better because they eliminate the things that don’t work and bad teams stay bad because they continue to do the things that don’t work,” said Henrickson. “[The Big West] is really good, young, fun and talented and exciting.”</p>\n<p>With momentum and anticipation of Big West competition, the Gauchos will certainly be put to the test as they seek to improve the process rather than simply the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Andrew Hernandez<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-2018 season has not been kind to the 49ers of the Long Beach State women’s basketball team so far. The team’s overall record of 2-16 is a far cry from the 9-6 record the team had at the end of its non-conference schedule last season.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had difficulty establishing a winning rhythm, and are winless at 0-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The team had eight players, including four seniors, leave from last year’s squad but were able to fill the spots by bringing seven freshmen to the team. Among those freshmen were Ma’Qhi Berry, Shanaijah Davison and Emma Merriweather, who have done their best to make their impact on the team felt. Each player has scored 100+ points so far this season, but the team has still found themselves coming up short.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ last win came on Dec. 7 in an exciting game that came down to the final minutes when senior Cecily Wilson put LBSU ahead by six with a layup. The 49ers were able to hold off GCU until time expired.</p>\n<p>Wilson is the only senior present within the team’s top four scorers and currently leads the 49ers in rebounds, averaging 6.6 a game. The veteran presence on the team has certainly taken a dive due to last year’s departures, but Wilson has shown that the team has the potential to do well given their significant amount of youth and guidance from the more experienced members of the team.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in conference play, we have to be more consistent on both ends off the floor. We have to stay disciplined and maintain our effort for 40 min,” Head Coach Jeff Cammon said. “To be specific, limit second chance opportunities by boxing out/rebounding on defensive end. Lastly, we have to take care of the ball and value possessions on [the] offensive end. This conference is tough, and we have to have a competitive mentality every night.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host UCSB Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Following last season’s below average 7-9 record in Big West conference play, the Cal Poly women’s basketball team entered this year with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Now 8-7 overall, the Mustangs will try to find areas in which they can improve their game.</p>\n<p>They currently hold a conference record of 2-1 as the Big West competition unfurls.</p>\n<p>After ending third to last in the previous Big West regular season, Cal Poly’s Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh will want to return to major tournament play during her 21st season in the manager role and after four appearances in either the NCAA Tournament or WNIT since 2011.</p>\n<p>To help achieve this she’ll look to her most veteran players for help on reaching this team goal.</p>\n<p>Trying to improve upon last season’s seeding of No. 7 overall, Cal Poly has already started off on the right foot with their 2-1 record that places them in a tie for third overall in the Big West conference standings.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly players to keep an eye on as the regular season rolls on would be junior center Devin Stanback, senior forward Emily Anderson and senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who are all statistical leaders in their own individual Big West categories.</p>\n<p>After coming off their most recent 84-71 win at home against the CSUN women’s basketball program, hopes are high for what this Cal Poly women’s basketball squad can truly accomplish.</p>\n<p>Made up of mostly returning upperclasswomen, spearheaded by Mimnaugh’s stellar coaching talents and a familiar game scheme aimed at success; this side expects at the very least a deep playoff run as it continues to progress into the 2017-18 campaign.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will host UC Davis this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Sean White<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Fullerton’s 1-15 conference record last season was the third time in program history that it finished with just one win in conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUF’s 16-16 record in 2006-07 was its last time ending a season with an overall record of .500 or above, and its 8-7 conference finish was its last conference winning record.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, such results led to the hiring of Head Coach Jeff Harada. In his first year, he has already helped the Titans eclipse their conference win total of last season.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 7-10, 2-2 in the Big West, the Titans are tied for fourth place in the conference. With no Big West Tournament appearances in the last two years, the Titans’ time to rise may be near.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned this year has been patience. As a coach we are all very competitive by nature and want to win every game we play right away,” Harada said. “Understanding the history and state of our program, my goal is obviously to change that, but I have to remind myself that it’s not going to happen overnight. It truly is a process. Turning those small victories into bigger ones will hopefully take us where we want to be in the future.”</p>\n<p>Key factors within this process are junior guards Hannah Thompson and Jade Vega, who both rank in the top 10 of the Big West in scoring with averages of 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell if Fullerton can manage to put together a run that will secure a spot within the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Until then, we wait for March.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Brandon Victor<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Despite losing its first five games of the season, the Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team looks like it could possibly contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>CSUN (8-9, 1-2) recovered from its tough start by ripping off four straight wins, however, things have slightly declined considering the Matadors’ current two-game losing streak after defeating Cal State Fullerton in their first conference game of the season, 70-68.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s recent slump, the presence of junior center Channon Fluker could possibly catapult the Matadors up the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Fluker, who was named the Big West Player of the Year last season, became the second player in Big West history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and blocks.</p>\n<p>In 17 games played this season, she has recorded eight double-doubles while averaging a conference leading 20.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Fluker even recorded a triple-double during the team’s Dec. 30 game against Seattle, scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, all while setting a conference record with 13 blocks en route to a 67-62 victory.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest strengths this season are our post play, depth and rebounding,” Head Coach Jason Flower said.</p>\n<p>The team will need to improve its late-game execution if it hopes to compete for the conference title this season. Other than a 48-point drubbing by Oregon to start the season, all of CSUN’s losses have been by single digits this season.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s next match is against Cal State Fullerton at  7p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18 at the Matadome.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Andrew Bishop<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Second-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue and her players entered the 2017-18 season with one goal in mind: to leave their 2016-17 season behind. Last year, the Anteaters went a paltry 5-26, with only three wins against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Last year I took over a team that was mainly senior-based,” Inoue said. “They did a good job, we just couldn’t finish games.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems Inoue faced going into this season was rebuilding a team that had recently lost a number of key seniors. “I had to replace a lot just because I was losing a lot,” she said. “A lot of the players from last year aren’t here this season, so it’s been a fresh start.”</p>\n<p>Irvine’s younger players have shared the bulk of the scoring throughout the majority of the season, with the help of sophomore guards Lauren Saiki (8.7 points per game) and Yazzy Sa’Dullah (7.7 points per game), and freshman forward Jordan Sanders (8.1 points per game).</p>\n<p>Irvine has also been supported in recent games by redshirt junior transfer guard Morgan Green, who made her Anteater debut on Jan. 4 against UC Davis. Green was sidelined throughout Irvine’s 2016-17 season, and the non-conference portion of its 2017-18 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.</p>\n<p>Despite suffering a loss to current conf. leader UC Davis in her first game as an Anteater, Green has lit up the scoreboard in her three appearances, averaging 22.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off of a 77-74 win against UCSB which puts them at 2-1 in conference play. They will hope to add to their win total and continue their comeback season as they face Cal Poly this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-18 season has been an odd one for the Hawaii women’s basketball team. After going 7-6 in non-conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were poised to make some noise come Big West play. Unfortunately for them, that has yet to be the case.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began conference play with three straight losses, with two on the road, but rebounded in their most recent effort in a home win against last place Long Beach State to have a 1-3 mark at this point in the conference season. They are currently in eighth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Hawaii has some good talent. They currently possess the second-best shooting percentage in the conference at 40.8 and average 64.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Their leading scorer has been senior guard Sarah Toeaina, who was named to the Preseason All-Conference team by both the media and the coaches. She currently averages 14.1 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the team averaging double figures is sophomore guard Julissa Tago, who is scoring 10.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The preseason poll had both coaches and the media expecting the Rainbow Wahine to finish in fourth place; however, with the struggles the team has going for them so far, there is no doubt there needs to be some work done before that prediction could become a reality.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing Hawaii has going for them, it is that they are currently 6-4 at home; however, now that Big West play is in full swing, they will need to shore up that defense on the road as well if they want to have some success.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s next match is against UCR on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Spencer Ault<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team entered the Big West Tournament with high hopes last season. UCSB brought those hopes crashing to the ground in the semifinals, defeating the Aggies 73-59 before falling to Long Beach State 56-55 in the finals.</p>\n<p>Disappointed as it was, UC Davis managed to bounce back in the WNIT. The Aggies advanced to the Sweet 16 after beating Utah and Colorado State, before falling to Washington State.</p>\n<p>Building off that postseason success, the Aggies are 13-3, and kicked off their season with ten straight wins.</p>\n<p>One of those wins came over Washington State in an impressive 91-76 victory that displayed how the Aggies have in fact improved from last year’s strong season. UCD’s success has continued in Big West play as well, as the team has gone 3-0 with victories over Irvine, Riverside and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch has borne the bulk of the scoring load for UCD with 19.8 points per game. Bertsch was named to the first-team All-Big West last season, and is on pace to earn a repeat of the honor on this go around.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Pele Gianotti joined Bertsch on that team last season. Gianotti has been effective this season as well with around ten points per game and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Rachel Nagel is next in line for scoring with 11.6 points per game, and has knocked down 42.6 percent of her three point attempts. That’s not the highest mark on the team, an honor that goes to senior guard Dani Nafekh, but it’s still a marksman-like percentage.</p>\n<p>UCD will have its first chance to redeem its semifinal upset loss when it takes on the Gauchos on Thursday, Jan. 18 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Kendra Jackson<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders are 5-13 overall and are currently 2-2 in Big West conference play. With a 3-4 record at home, the team has only managed to reign victorious away from the confines of the UCR Student Recreation Center once this season.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, when considering the team’s progress last season, the Highlanders ended as the fourth seed in the Big West tournament. With a 16-15 record overall and 9-7 in conference play, the initial first round matchup for UCR turned out to be the eighth seeded UC Irvine Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In terms of moving forward, UCR can still set its sights on a legitimate playoff run if it focuses on improving its record in conference play and dedicating itself to winning games not just at home, but also while on the road.</p>\n<p>With a playmaker like senior guard Michelle Curry running the show and redshirt sophomore forward Skyler Lewis collecting the boards, UCR definitely has the talent to right the ship.</p>\n<p>Curry averages 15.5 points per game, fourth best mark in the conference while Lewis averages 7.6 rebounds per game, also the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, the Highlanders are the sixth seed, but conference play has just begun and there is plenty of time to improve, especially since UCR is not too far behind Cal State Fullerton in the standings. If their conference play begins to excel, they can make a splash in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off its most recent win against the CSUF at home in which senior guard Lauren Holt dropped 22 points, UCR is set to ride that momentum when it takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 18</em><em>, 2018</em><em>, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/","id":846,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[845,844,843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer First Conf.

While the Gauchos also went 1-6 from beyond the arc in the first, Drew Edelman went to work in the paint, scoring 9 of her team-high 18 points in the decently-even quarter.

Sarah Porter managed to hit a three with 2 seconds remaining as part of her 8-point quarter, but it was too late for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing only by 3 points, Santa Barbara has to be disappointed, but the continual growth of the Gauchos this season is perhaps a silver lining head coach Bonnie Henrickson can find in this game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos matched the Anteaters in many aspects and even held the advantage in the paint as well as in terms of bench production. UCSB outscored Irvine 28-22 down low and got 26 points from its bench, but the difference in the game seemed to be free-throws. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Anteaters managed to go 18 for 23 from the charity stripe, the Gauchos only made 8 of their 15 free throws. Santa Barbara with its 23 personal fouls committed marks a season-high for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite giving Irvine 18 points from free-throws, UCSB’s offense has now scored 70 points or higher in 5 of its last 6 games. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Drew Edelman with another double-double is almost averaging one with 14 ppg and 9.4 rebounds per game. As Santa Barbara’s offense is rolling, the Gauchos will likely work on their defensive game-plan this week before playing Thursday in an effort to cut down on fouls. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the Gauchos work Drea Toler back into games, Santa Barbara will aim to get back on track at home against UC Davis on Thursday, January 18.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Directly after, the Gauchos struck back by going on a powerful 9-0 run to gain a three-point lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The score was tied once again at the end of the third quarter, all knotted up at 56.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The visitors opened up the forth on an 8-0 run, which included three pointers being scored by both freshman guard Sarah Bates and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, with Bates again contributing 2 more points to cap off the run.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN wouldn’t lie down, though, as they kept the game close. Calling a timeout with 32 ticks on the clock left to play, Cal State Northridge went to their junior center Channon Fluker, who intensified the closeness of the game by scoring a clutch layup to create a 73-70 score at 20 seconds, UCSB still holding the lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the score, sophomore guard Hayley Tanabe forced a turnover for the Gauchos and came up with the pivotal steal in crunch time and called a timeout immediately after the grab.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Down three points and going for the tie, the Matadors put the game in the hands of their junior guard Claudia Ramos, who’s three-point attempt ended up missing the mark.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the three-pointer from Ramos fell short, Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman snagged the rebound. Upon grabbing the board, Edelman was fouled by Fluker.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While at the charity stripe, Edelman missed her initial free throw attempt, but drained the second free throw with just four seconds left to play in regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The home team, with possession and no timeouts left, quickly inbounded the ball and gave it to Ramos, who splashed in a three-pointer to beat the final buzzer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Though exciting, the basket by Ramos was futile, as the final score was officially 74-73 at the end of regulation – with Santa Barbara taking the win.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While UCSB had a slightly better field goal percentage (40.0%) than the Matadors (39.4%), the home team also won some standout stats the sheet. The most notable discrepancy between the Gauchos and their opponents was the domination of the points in the paint by the home team.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN scored a tremendous 48 points in the paint, compared to the less than half 22 points Santa Barbara had scored in the paint.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the game, Bates exploded for a team-leading 23 points for UCSB, going 6-11 from the field and shooting 5-7 from beyond the arc. Bates also led her team in assists, dishing out 5 dimes during regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior small forward Chaya Durr grabbed 9 boards, tying Matador junior center Channon Fluker for the game high in rebounds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For CSUN, senior forward Tessa Boagni scored a game-high 25 points, and her teammate Tanabe dispensed a game-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sitting at 3-0 in the conference, Santa Barbara looks to hold onto their streak in the Big West this weekend as they face UC Irvine on the road at Bren Events Center on Saturday January 13 at 7:00pm.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On Thursday night, the UCSB men’s basketball team blew a 20-point-plus lead to Cal Poly. On Saturday night against UC Riverside, the Gauchos almost did it again.</p>\n<p>Just two nights removed from a heartbreaking 80-79 loss to the Mustangs, the Gauchos picked up their first Big West win of the season against the Highlanders by a score of 65-57, pushing UCSB to 12-4 overall and 1-1 in league play.</p>\n<p>Eight minutes into their game against Cal Poly on Thursday, it seemed as though the Gauchos were destined to pick up their first league win in their first try. The Mustangs had no answer for UCSB, which jumped out to a 23-2 lead with 12:54 remaining in the first half.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The early Gaucho offensive explosion was driven by a balanced offensive attack. Six different players scored in that 23-2 run, and four players ended the first half with at least five points.</p>\n<p>The last ten minutes of the first half were markedly different from the first. Cal Poly ran off a 20-5 run at the end of the half to cut the Gaucho lead to 40-36 at halftime, as the hosts scored only eight points in the last eight minutes.</p>\n<p>While the first half was defined by two opposing runs, the second half was back-and-forth on a more microscopic level. With 13 lead changes in the second half alone, neither team was willing to let the other rest.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty had the hot hand in the second half, shooting 8-10 from the field for 17 points, one for each minute he played in the period. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger, normally the Gauchos’ most dependable and prolific scorer, was comparatively cold in going 2-10 for nine points in the last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>For all his second half struggles, however, Heidegger made the shot his team needed him to. After Donovan Fields layup brought the Mustangs into a 77-77 tie, Heidegger buried a tough midrange jumper to give UCSB a 79-77 lead with exactly one second remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>Up two with just one clock tick to go, all the Gauchos had to do in order to secure their fourth win in a row and first in Big West play was to contest any last-second shot without fouling. They were unsuccessful in doing so.</p>\n<p>Fields, inbounding the ball, ran the baseline and hit Luke Meikle with a long pass over halfcourt. Meikle used his time wisely, getting Canty in the air with a pumpfake and drawing a three-shot foul with a desperation heave.</p>\n<p>Three clutch free throws and one missed full court shot later, and the Mustangs had completed their comeback in dramatic fashion with a 80-79 victory.</p>\n<p>Canty’s unfortunate foul didn’t diminish his standout performance on Thursday night. The forward led UCSB with 21 points and six blocks, and added 10 rebounds for his second double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Leland King II was the Gauchos’ leading rebounder with 15 boards, his best rebounding performance of the season. King also had 12 points, giving him his third double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Coming off such a brutal loss as the one they suffered on Thursday night, the Gauchos needed a strong bounce back showing on Saturday against the Highlanders. They got exactly that, thanks largely to a dominant game from King.</p>\n<p>The graduate transfer had 17 points in the first half alone on Saturday in the Thunderdome, and finished with 22 on the night. His 13 rebounds gave King his fourth double-double in a row, and helped the Gauchos overcome a quiet 2-point night from Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Neither team shot the ball particularly well from the field, as UCSB shot 39 percent while UCR shot 38 percent, but the Gauchos made up for it with 11 made threes on 28 attempts. Five of those threes came off the fingertips of Heidegger, who was second on the team with 19 points.</p>\n<p>Despite leading by 24 points with just 16 minutes to play, the Gauchos came close to blowing yet another massive lead. Riverside’s DJ Sylvester sank a layup with 5:06 remaining to make the score 56-51 but a couple of Heidegger three pointers boosted the lead back into more comfortable territory for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Highlander forward Alex Larsson was his team’s most efficient contributor with 10 points on 5-10 shooting, and his 11 rebounds gave the 6-10 senior a double-double of his own. Sylvester, at 4-13 from the field, was far less efficient, but still managed to lead Riverside with 13 points.</p>\n<p>After playing two games in three days, the Gauchos now get a whole week off in order to prepare for a road game in Hawaii on Saturday, when they’ll take on the Rainbow Warriors. Hawaii’s record of 10-5, 1-1 looks remarkably similar to UCSB’s, setting Saturday’s matchup up as an intriguing barometer for both teams.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hawaii on Saturday in Honolulu at 10:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80398\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80398\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/","id":825,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[824,823,822],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hang on to Win Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Blue-Green rivalry ended in favor of UCSB when the final buzzer went off.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s team survived a late Cal Poly comeback effort on Saturday to open the first week of Big West play 2-0. Starting the fourth quarter the Gauchos were ahead of the Mustangs by 19 points, but a Mustang effort to make the game interesting prompted a 14-2 run during a stretch in the final quarter. Without a field goal for over four minutes, the Gauchos were lucky enough to make enough free throws in the end, coming out on top 73-68.</p>\n<p>Although conference season is far from over, the Gauchos now sit at second in the Big West behind fellow 2-0 UC Davis. After starting the season 1-9, Santa Barbara, now 5-9,  has won its last four games, effectively turning the season around for conference play. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson knows there’s still room for improvement, “We aren’t where we were, we aren’t where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly’s comeback effort falling short, the Mustangs settle back in to .500, 1-1 in the Big West and 7-7 overall. Cal Poly’s senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who came into the game off a 40-point performance in an overtime win over UC Riverside, had a game-high 30 points on 27 shots at the Thunderdome. In an off night shooting for Leaupepe and her teammates, Cal Poly finished the game 26 for 70 from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first quarter of play found both teams locked at 0-0 until the 6:42 mark, when Makala Roper drove the lane and finished, giving the Gauchos the 2-0 lead. Roper, a senior, had 7 of her 15 points in the first quarter, and finished the game with a career high 9 assists. Bringing defensive energy early, Santa Barbara held the Mustangs to just 8 points off 18 percent shooting in the quarter, leading 11-8 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>“I know everything can get flustered,” said Roper post-game, “and I’m the point guard so I need to make sure everyone’s calm. I have to make sure to have a level head so everything is okay.”</p>\n<p>Despite Cal Poly’s terrible shooting effort in the first, the Mustangs continued to put pressure on Santa Barbara in a variety of press and trap defenses. Obviously feeling this pressure, the Gauchos turned the ball over 8 times in the first quarter alone and went on to turn it over 7 more times in the second.</p>\n<p>In the high-octane second quarter, Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 28-16 to take a 39-24 going into halftime. The Gauchos had no problem finding the net, shooting over 60 percent overall and from downtown. Dynn Leaupepe put her team on her back in the quarter, scoring 13 of her team’s 16 points, but it wasn’t enough to counter the Gauchos’ weapon off the bench: Tal Sahar. Sahar, who didn’t log a single minute in the team’s victory over Long Beach on Thursday, came alive in the second to score all of her 17 points in the quarter. The redshirt sophomore said after the game, “From the first shot I took, I was like, okay, this is going to be a good game.” Sahar’s energy was part of an 11-2 UCSB run to open the quarter, forcing a Mustang timeout.</p>\n<p>Senior Chaya Durr spoke following the game, addressing Sahar’s contribution. “Tal came in with great minutes off the bench and got us hyped up as well,” Durr said, “She was knocking down shots and we were just feeding off of it. It was just working.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another hot quarter in the third, shooting 50 percent from three. While Dynn Leaupepe herself scored another 7 in the quarter, Sarah Bates and Chaya Durr each had 8 for UCSB and Roper added 6 as the Gauchos outscored the Mustangs 24-20. Durr finished the game with 10 points and 8 boards, hitting a three at the buzzer to put her team up 63-44 heading into the final quarter.</p>\n<p>Up by 19 with just 10 minutes left to play, the Gauchos seemed in control. After the Mustangs hit a pair of threes, Drew Edelman made a layup with 6:50 left to give Santa Barbara a comfortable 17-point lead. With 11 points and a game-high 10 boards, Edelman finished with a double-double on an efficient 5 of 7 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs refused to go away, though, organizing a trapping press defense that flustered the Gauchos. Facing the pressure, Santa Barbara lost possession a total 10 times in the fourth to record a season-high 33 turnovers on the night. The Mustangs took advantage of Santa Barbara’s mistakes, scoring 39 points off turnovers over the course of the game, but it wasn’t until the final quarter that Cal Poly closed the gap. An 11-0 Poly run forced a UCSB timeout with just 2:55 remaining, the Gauchos now only ahead 67-61. Their 19-point lead diminished to just 6, the Gauchos regrouped during the timeout to extend their lead to 8 off a Roper jumpshot. In desperation mode, the Mustangs got a quick three-ball and a layup to fall, moving within three of the Gauchos, 66-69 with just under 2 minutes to go. With 55 seconds left, Sarah Bates got to the rim with a nice move for an and-one. The freshman guard, who finished with 17, completed the three-point play to give her team the 72-66 point lead. With time running out, Cal Poly was forced to fire up some quick shots, but it was too little, too late. The Gauchos survived the comeback effort, holding on to win 73-68.</p>\n<p>With 33 turnovers, the Gauchos’ win over Cal Poly has some areas of concern for head coach Bonnie Henrickson, but also some positives. “Clearly, we’ve got to be better with more poise and composure,” said Henrickson, “I thought Chaya [Durr] defensively was really good on Dynn [Leaupepe], I thought our scouting report defense was really good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now have two road games ahead of them, versus CSU Northridge and UC Irvine this coming week. On a winning streak and still making improvements, 2-0 Santa Barbara is certainly eager to continue Big West play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/","id":819,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[818,817,816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast 49ers in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"The Big West season is officially underway, and the UCSB women's basketball team has its first win.

The Gauchos have now won their last three games and with Thursday night’s win over the 49ers Santa Barbara is 1-0 in conference play, improving their overall record to 4-9. While UCSB is rolling compared to the start of the season, the 49ers are pushed to a dismal 2-13 overall as they open league play with their sixth straight loss.</p>\n<p>A rematch of last year’s Big West Championship, in which Long Beach got the best of the Gauchos, Thursday night’s game opened with an energy in the Thunderdome signaling the return of conference-play atmosphere. The 49ers pressured Santa Barbara using a 3-2 zone along with a full-court press disrupting the Gauchos’ offense early. Shots weren’t falling easily for either team and the Gauchos had a difficult time keeping possession, turning the ball over 7 times in the first quarter alone.</p>\n<p>For nearly the first seven minutes of play, UCSB had only 3 points off a Drew Edelman free throw and a jumper by Danae Miller. The defensive battle had the score locked at 5-3 Long Beach before Makala Roper knocked down a three for the Gauchos with 3:38 remaining. A few back and forth buckets closed out the quarter 12-12.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson said following the game, “Sometimes you’ve got to be able to handle that this might one of those nights, it might be in the forties and fifties and you’ve got to be comfortable doing that,” said Henrickson, “You’ve got to be able to play through that and still win in the fifties.”</p>\n<p>Makala Roper got things going for Santa Barbara in the second quarter, draining her second three ball of the night to put the Gauchos ahead 15-12. Long Beach responded by going on an 8-0 run, forcing head coach Bonnie Henrickson to call a quick timeout with roughly 6:04 remaining. Out of the 30-second timeout, the Gauchos went inside to find Edelman in back to back possessions for two easy buckets. Edelman asserted herself in the paint throughout the game, getting good position as well as good looks at the basket, but had a hard time getting shots to fall. The redshirt senior did have a career night rebounding the ball, grabbing 23 boards while just missing a double-double with 9 points. Roper kept heating up, making another shot from beyond the arc to put the Gauchos down a single point heading into halftime 22-23.</p>\n<p>The first half of play featured both squads struggling to find the net, as UCSB and Long Beach each shot close to 31 percent overall and 27 percent from three-point territory. Edelman had 13 of her final 23 rebounds at half, but UCSB also committed 13 turnovers in the half.</p>\n<p>In spite of their rough start shooting, the Gauchos came out after halftime with a re-focused energy on both ends of the court. Santa Barbara opened the third on a 9-0 run, holding the 49ers scoreless for almost 5 minutes. UCSB went on to score 17 total points in the quarter, with Sarah Bates, Sarah Porter and again Roper chipping in a three-pointer each. Roper’s three came at the buzzer to lift the Gauchos to a 39-28 advantage after three quarters of play. The 49ers had a rough quarter to say the least, going 1-10 from the field, 0-4 from three, and 3-10 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper made another three to kick off the fourth quarter for her game and season-high 15 points, all from beyond the arc. Long Beach guard Shanijah Davison got to the line on the following possession, converting 1 of 2 free throws. The freshman Davison had a difficult night, shooting only 1-10 from the field and finishing the game with 4 points. Heading into the game, Davison was the 49ers’ leading scorer with 11.9 points per game. 49er Cecily Wilson knocked down 1 of 2 shots from the line shortly after Davison, but the Gauchos answered with an Akilah Jennings three to take their largest lead of the night, up 15, with 8:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>Down 45-30 with just 8:50 left, 49ers refused to back off as Long Beach upped their defensive pressure to disrupt the Gauchos. After Akilah jennings made a nice move to the basket for a bucket at the 6:51 mark, the Gauchos failed to make another shot aside from free throws. Long Beach used their defensive stops to generate offense, going on a 10-0 run over the next 6 minutes to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 3. Cecily Wilson had 7 of her team-high 9 points in the fourth to go with her team-high 10 rebounds. Down 47-44 with 53 seconds left, Long Beach mistakenly fouled Sarah Bates, sending her to the line where she knocked down the two free throws. Sloppy play and a variety of weird calls by the referees found the 49ers forced to send Bates to the line again with only 3 seconds to go. Bates came up clutch at the line again, hitting both shots to give the Gauchos the 51-44 victory.</p>\n<p>After the game, the freshman guard Bates discussed her team’s improved play in the third quarter. “I think we got a little more used to the pressure, but we were still struggling with it. It was our offense more than their defense, even though they’re a good defensive team,” said Bates.</p>\n<p>Following the Gauchos’ 1-9 start in the regular season, the Gauchos finally have momentum and a growing identity when they play. “I mean it’s a lot better than being 1-9,” said Drew Edelman, “We have a little bit more confidence going in. Especially now that it’s conference play, we said, ‘Ok whatever our record was preseason ultimately it doesn’t matter, it’s all about conference.’”</p>\n<p>With a big game against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Santa Barbara is hoping to carry its energy further into conference play. “It was a process, we’ve learned from it. So now, new season, we’re 1 and 0,” continued Edelman.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson is looking to continue her team’s growth this season, as beating the now 2-13 49ers is not as daunting as a task as beating Cal Poly. “So, we’re fortunate to find a way to win, but that locker room is mature enough to know we weren’t very good and we’ve got to be better on Saturday, and we’ll get a chance to be better on  Saturday,” said Henrickson, “And we’re mature enough to recognize that.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry game Saturday afternoon, with tip-off scheduled for 2:00pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/","id":781,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[780,779,778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Host Long Beach and Cal Poly to Open Big West Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The start of conference play just might be the best complement to UCSB recent win streak as it heads home to host LBSU and Cal Poly.

Thursday’s game against the 49ers seems like it will be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as Long Beach is in the midst of a five-game slide and sit at 2-12 overall this season.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their sub-par record, the 49ers are being led by promising freshman Shanaijah Davison. The 5’8 guard is averaging a team-high 11.9 points per game, and put up 29 points versus USC earlier this season.</p>\n<p>With seven freshmen on the Long Beach roster, another promising player has been 6’5 center Emma Merriweather. Only a freshman, Merriweather has recorded an impressive 22 total blocks in addition to averaging 9.2 points and 5.7 boards per contest. Long Beach will be eager to snap their losing streak when it faces UCSB, but the Gauchos have some talent on their roster as well.</p>\n<p>As a redshirt senior, forward Drew Edelman hasn’t slowed down, leading the Gauchos through their rough patch with 15.2 points and just over 8 rebounds per game. Edelman has performed closer to her ability lately, posting a 25 and 10 double-double in Santa Barbara’s win over San Diego State while she continues to be a vocal leader for her team on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB has some promising freshmen of its own, with first-year guard Sarah Bates coming up big in recent contests. Bates has scored in double figures in her last two games and is playing big minutes as a freshman, averaging a little over 25 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest between the 49ers and Gauchos will interestingly enough be a repeat of last year’s Big West Tournament championship game. Long Beach squeaked out the win over UCSB in a nail-biter, so the Gauchos are likely eager to redeem themselves on top of extending their winning streak.</p>\n<p>The action will tip off at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m. as UCSB looks to earn just its second home victory this season.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against the 49ers on Thursday, Santa Barbara will have a short break before hosting rival Cal Poly at the Thunderdome for an afternoon contest on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have had their respective ups and downs this season, sitting at the .500 mark with a 6-6 record. Cal Poly will visit UC Riverside Thursday before heading to the Thunderdome. The Mustangs have been led by the senior duo of sisters Dynn and Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>The Leaupepe duo features Dynn scoring 15.7 ppg and Lynn averaging a close 14.1 ppg. UCSB was torched by Dynn in last year’s January game, as she scored a season-high 29 points in the Mustang victory so the Santa Barbara coaching staff will undoubtedly work towards containing her on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will tip off at 2 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 6 as the Gauchos and Mustangs will both be looking for bragging rights in addition to improving their records.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/","id":770,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[769,768,767],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":12,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
