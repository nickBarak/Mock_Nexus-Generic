You want to get that stuff out of your system.”</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB junior guard Orlando Johnson and forward James Nunnally combined for 43 of the team’s points in the win, teaming up for three separate fast break alley-oops and shooting a combined 53.5 percent from the field. Nunnally had 15 points in the second half to go with 10 rebounds.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s not just a two-man game,” Nunnally said. “We try to get everyone involved.”</p>\n<p>With the lack of Nunnally’s presence in the first half offensively, the Gauchos went to the locker rooms with a narrow lead, 30-28. Master’s struggled to move the ball inside thanks to the Gauchos’ size advantage, but the first half saw the team hit six of its 10 field goals from behind the three-point line. Master’s guard Anthony Cammon was 4-5 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“That little guard is a good little player,” Williams said. “They’ve got two very good guards, but our pressure wore them out. [Our] defense is kind of like Chinese water torture. It just kind of wears on you as it goes on.”</p>\n<p>Master’s committed 12 turnovers in the game — the maximum amount Williams hopes to get in future games. Williams went with his team’s tallest lineup to start the game, including 7’3” junior center Greg Somogyi, who started in one game all of last season. Somogyi had eight points but tied junior point guard William Brew with four rebounds.</p>\n<p>“If his activity level is high, I like the idea of playing him some more,” Williams said. “There will be nights we start small and nights we start big.”</p>\n<p>Listed at 6’6”, Nunnally may prove to be a significant part of the Gauchos’ lineup flexibility this season. On a few positions at the end of the game, he brought the ball up the court, joking after that he was a natural “point-forward.”</p>\n<p>However, the wing’s team-leading number of boards on the night suggests to Williams that he could place Nunnally in the power forward spot.</p>\n<p>“I love the flexibility of playing [Nunnally] at the four,” Williams said. “If Nun rebounds like he did tonight? He was a man out there. Nun could play small and big. Same with Orlando.”</p>\n<p>While their regular season starts on Nov. 20 against Fresno State at the Thunderdome, the Gauchos will first travel to Eugene, Oregon on Nov. 12, where they will face Denver in the first of three games at the BTI Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/johnson-nunnally-combine-43-seasonopening-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/johnson-nunnally-combine-43-seasonopening-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/johnson-nunnally-combine-43-seasonopening-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/johnson-nunnally-combine-43-seasonopening-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/johnson-nunnally-combine-43-seasonopening-win/","id":916,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[915,914,913],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Down Masters College in Exhibition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Guard Orlando Johnson and forward James Nunnally combined for 43 points in the Gauchos’ 68-54 win against Master’s College at the Thunderdome on Friday night.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Guard Orlando Johnson and forward James Nunnally combined for 43 points in the Gauchos’ 68-54 win against Master’s College at the Thunderdome on Friday night.  “It’s not just a two-man game,” Nunnally said. “We try to get everyone involved.”  The Gauchos committed 10 turnovers in the first half alone and the Mustangs managed to stay within two points after going six for 13 from the three-point line.

Sophomore forward Sweets Underwood, an all-conference freshman last season, will be another key for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I want to play more aggressive,” Underwood said. “I have played college basketball for one year now and I need to play with more experience and maturity than I had. I need to look as if I have that one year of experience already.”</p>\n<p>With more experience, and an offseason of hard work under their belts, the Gauchos will try to improve as a team.</p>\n<p>“There are always skills to improve,” junior guard Emilie Johnson said. “The offseason is a time to get better and improve those skills so we can be a better team. The team flows better when we all become more skilled.”</p>\n<p>Johnson, who finished fourth in the conference last season with 13.8 points per game, will be another veteran presence on a young team.</p>\n<p>“There is a great team chemistry. We are like a family,” said Emilie Johnson. “Everyone is so close on and off the court. It is a fun group. When you are close off the court, it translates on the court.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its season tomorrow night at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome with an exhibition match against Monterey Bay before the regular season begins with an away game at Pepperdine on Nov. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/defensiveminded-gauchos-surprise-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/defensiveminded-gauchos-surprise-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/defensiveminded-gauchos-surprise-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/defensiveminded-gauchos-surprise-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/defensiveminded-gauchos-surprise-big-west/","id":915,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[914,913,912],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heat Check","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Everyone who’s anyone knows about the Miami Heat.

LeBron, his decision and the somewhat shady circumstances surrounding the formation of Miami Thrice (sign-and-trades to preempt a tampering investigation, anyone?) have rightfully dominated conversations surrounding the NBA, mostly about how awesome they’re going to be offensively. But what if we’re wrong?</p>\n<p>If the Heat proved anything so far, it’s that what we thought about them could not have been more off-target. Rather than being a free-wheeling, run-and-shoot team with LeBron acting as a mutant Magic Johnson-Dominique Wilkins hybrid, the Heat have made their bones as a slow-it-down, defensively dominant juggernaut. The Heat are a middle-of-the-road offensive team (they’re tied with San Antonio for 10th in offensive efficiency with 103.8 points per 100 possessions) with a defense so suffocating that not even our governor would be able to get the people some air. They rank first in defensive efficiency, allowing 86.8 points per 100 possessions. Some perspective: The difference between them and third-ranked Orlando (93.2) is slightly less than the difference between Orlando and 13th-ranked Toronto. Some more perspective: The league leaders last year (Charlotte and Orlando) finished with 100.2 in the defensive efficiency column. Yeah, they’re that good.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s still early in the season. I doubt anyone really thinks that Dallas will continue to hold serve as the second-best defensive team in the NBA, or that Miami will continue to be quite this dominant on the defensive end. Sooner or later, your schedule includes the Suns and Hawks (quietly an amazing offensive team, adjusted for pace) of the world and that number starts slipping, but when you limit the Orlando Magic to 70 points despite concerns about your ability to handle quality big men, you’re working with something special.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When you think about their performance, we shouldn’t be surprised. LeBron and Wade are two of the world’s best wing defenders. Paired with the shot blocking presence of Joel Anthony and the steady hand of Erik Spoelstra, it’s perfectly logical that this team would be awesome on D. Add in the upcoming presence of Mario Chalmers at the point replacing Carlos Arroyo in the starting role, and you have the genesis of what could be the best defensive team in the league this season.</p>\n<p>Another thing that we shouldn’t be surprised about is the snail’s-pace offense of the Heat, which is second-slowest in the league trailing only the Bobcats. Spoelstra led the Heat to the third-lowest mark in the league last season and seems to be instilling the same type of ethic in this year’s bunch. Spoelstra is a better coach than people realize. He spent the past two years teaming with Wade to drag the Heat into respectability despite featuring Dwyane and four expiring contracts in the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>Those of us looking for the greatest show on hardwood have up to this point been severely disappointed, but there’s no reason to give up on the Heat’s greatness. They will be great, just not in the way we expected. Those of us expecting fireworks have instead been treated to a gang more interested in anaconda-style defense and counting on the attrition of their two all-world stars (and Chris Bosh!) to grind the opposition into submission.

In the end, it seems that LeBron truly believes that you measure the success of a career by the number of championships won. And isn’t that how it is supposed to be? Winning is everything; at the end of the day, it is the name on the front of the jersey that matters, and the Cavs just couldn’t get it done. It’s a shame, but it’s the way it is, and anyone who is surprised by his ditching Cleveland is simply naïve.</p>\n<p>Now for the historical spin.</p>\n<p>Recently, Michael Jordan lent his opinion on the issue: “There is no way I would have ever called up Larry [Bird] and Magic [Johnson] and said, ‘Hey let’s get together and play on one team.’ In all honesty, I was trying to beat those guys.”</p>\n<p>The fact that the media feels the need to compare everyone everything to Michael Jordan proves beyond reasonable doubt that MJ is the greatest basketball player that ever lived. Yes, it is possible for him to be caught, but no, there will never be another Jordan. If Kobe Bryant matches his six rings, he still has work left to do.</p>\n<p>Jordan won three straight MVPs and led the Bulls to three straight NBA Championships, retired in the prime of his career to play a little professional baseball, then returned to the Bulls to win three more MVPs and titles in a row. I’ll wait while you read that again…there will never be another MJ.</p>\n<p>Is LeBron giving up a chance to be the greatest ever? Yes, but only to an extent. Let’s say the Heat win 70 games this year, LeBron averages a triple-double, and Miami dominates and wins five-plus championships in the coming years. The argument against him would be that he had more help. And it’s true. But wait. Didn’t Magic have James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Didn’t Larry Bird have Kevin McHale and Robert Parish?</p>\n<p>So LeBron gave up a chance at becoming one of the greatest individual players in the history of the NBA. So he doesn’t have the competitive fire that MJ had, or that Kobe has. But remember, this competitive drive can be learned, honed and harnessed. Just look at Kobe and his transformation from a selfish, high-flying scorer with an afro wearing #8 into an intelligent, technical, savvy family-man who wears #24 and hits MJ fadeaways to crush opponents. It can happen. And I think we will see this ruthless assassin fire and instinct from LeBron this year.</p>\n<p>In the end, I think LeBron is a pompous, egotistical person. But does it matter? I say not. To be real, I am over it, and even legitimately happy that he decided to go to Miami. Will I root for the Heat? Absolutely not. But I will acknowledge that the Heat will be one of the most exciting teams this year. As a basketball fan, I can’t wait to see LeBron running the point like Magic, with Wade on his right and Bosh on his left.</p>\n<p>Although it may be hard to believe, there are actually some other interesting storylines heading into the new NBA season. Apart from Miami, here are a few of particular interest to yours truly:</p>\n<p><strong>Will the Lakers repeat?</strong></p>\n<p>I say yes. Kobe is Kobe. Pau Gasol is Pau Gasol. I would say the key is Andrew Bynum, but I believe the Lakeshow can take the title even if Bynum is the same injury-prone player of a year ago (and it’s looking that way). Lamar Odom started at center — and played very well — for the U.S. national team this summer, and will form a great frontcourt with Gasol. The key is defense. With the new additions of Steve Blake and Matt Barnes, the Lakers added depth and another defense wingman for a team that will have the luxury of resting its stars during the season (Kobe mainly), knowing that it will all come down to the playoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Where will Carmelo Anthony land?</strong></p>\n<p>I am assuming that the Denver front office is smart enough to move Anthony now, before they lose him for nothing (like Toronto did when Bosh bolted for South Beach). The most interesting landing spot for Carmelo is obviously New York, where he would be paired with Stoudemire in a Mike D’Antoni fast break offense. I’m intrigued.</p>\n<p><strong>Which point guard or guards will make the jump to elite?</strong></p>\n<p>The way I see it now, there are three top point guards in the league: Chris Paul, Deron Williams and Steve Nash. Chauncey Billups and Jason Kidd are still around and contributing at a high level, but they are old. And the young guns are about to take the jump to the elite.</p>\n<p>Look for Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook to lead this charge, with a secondary group of John Wall, Brandon Jennings and Tyreke Evans not too far behind. All three are great, no doubt, but have shown weaknesses in the past. Rondo has the all-around game, but lacks a consistent shot. The same could be said for Rose and Westbrook, but each year all three have improved. Look for this group to make a huge leap this season, both individually and with their respective teams.</p>\n<p><strong>The Clippers!</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah baby, a little love for LA’s other team. Blake Griffin is a beast and Eric Gordon will build on his strong showing for Team USA over the summer. I haven’t been this excited about a Clippers team since the Darius Miles, Quentin Richardson, Odom and Michael Olowokandi days (depressing, right?).</p>\n<p><strong>How will the East play out?</strong></p>\n<p>The East is a three horse race, with one potential surprise. Miami, Boston, and Orlando will continue to reign supreme. In fact, Boston and Orlando have the potential to upset the Heat, because they possess the one thing that can thwart Miami’s big three — size. Dwight Howard, if he ever learns how to play some low-post offense, has the potential to single-handedly take his team to the NBA finals. If Perkins comes back healthy, the Celts will have a massive front-line of Perkins, Jermaine O’Neal, and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>The Chicago Bulls could surprise and rise into this conversation. Although Boozer is hurt to begin the year, he is the scoring low-post presence Chicago has been looking for and his defensive shortcomings will be masked by Joakim Noah’s prowess. And that guy Derrick Rose is okay too, I guess.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/nba-lebron-kobe-carmelo-clippers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/nba-lebron-kobe-carmelo-clippers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/nba-lebron-kobe-carmelo-clippers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/nba-lebron-kobe-carmelo-clippers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/nba-lebron-kobe-carmelo-clippers/","id":907,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[906,905,904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Once-Forgotten Celtics are Now Looking Luckier","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I wrote that the Celtics were over the hill, but some events have transpired — i.e. the Celtics won — that, as of late, have forced me to re-evaluate my entire life.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>So. This is awkward. I admit it. I wrote that the Celtics were over the hill, but some events have transpired — i.e. the Celtics won — that, as of late, have forced me to re-evaluate my entire life. Or, at the very least, they forced me to reevaluate my view of the NBA Playoffs.  Usually I use this column to thrust onto my loyal readers (which at this point could just be my immediate family) my opinion on all things sports. Even though it is simply an opinion, and not fact, I can still stand to be corrected. And in this case, I deserve some serious revision.</p>\n<p>Yes, the Celtics won. And please don’t be sitting there saying “I told you so!” I don’t buy it because we were all thinking the same thing. That is, KG and company were going to look mighty fine in their fishing garb come late April, or maybe, if they were lucky, early May.</p>\n<p>Somehow, these old-timers have clotheslined Father Time on their way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they took Game One on the Magic’s home court. These are the Celtics that, two weeks ago, I thought didn’t have a chance in hell to dethrone Prince James and the wandering buffoons he calls teammates. And let it be known, I have no problem demoting the King to Prince. And I have absolutely no qualms with demoting him to Joker James if he strings together the same sort of pathetic performances next season that he put together for four of the six games of the SECOND ROUND of the playoffs. But I digress.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Celtics have made Boston believe again. Heck, they made the baby boomers believe that even though the clock is always ticking, you always have time left. The Celtics, instead of copping out and blaming ailing knees, bruised joints or, in Ray Allen’s case, an exhausted jaw (really, as a notorious gum addict myself, the guy needs to stop chewing so hard, and so often; it looks odd and gives him a perpetual scowl that will surely lead to frown lines), they have zoned in even more so on their improbable goal of reaching the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Sure, they have had a fair share of old man, scratch-your-head moments, like squandering away the big lead in game one, or playing with the same intensity and heart as crash dummies in game three. However, the Celtics, through it all, put together some insane performances over their last series. I mean, two monumental blowouts, as well as two solidly-crafted close-out games, are efforts you could relate to the 2008 Champion Celtics of old, not these old Celtics. Note that when I say old, I’m not necessarily referring to age, although their core three are 99 years old combined. I’m really just alluding to their “look,” or the reputation that precedes them. I already wrote once that Paul Pierce looks like he needs to take a nap (for, like, ever), and I will defend my opinion to my grave. As for the other two, KG walks on two hobbled knees, and Ray Allen has been playing since the turn of the century it seems. Like I said, they shout old.</p>\n<p>However, General Manager Danny Ainge has surrounded them with youth, nullifying the old-timer factor. That little punk Rondo has proved his invaluable worth to the team, as well as the other young’n’, Perkins. On yet another side note, I am happy to report the Big Baby has not been too beneficial this series, except for missing shots at the charity stripe and pushing over little kids in the Celtics’ hallway.</p>\n<p>I tremendously underestimated the Celtics’ youth leading into the playoffs. The only one yet to be stably revitalized is Pierce, but he seemed to have some semblance of a break-out game in game five of the East Coast Semi’s and had a pretty strong outing two nights ago as well. Still, only time will tell if he chooses to ride the high or push the snooze button on his internal clock. The Celtics’ success in the postseason can be attributed to their blend of maturity levels on the roster. On paper, the 100 years between their “superstars” is not all that attractive, but when infused with the energy of emerging powerhouses like Rondo, it works. </p>\n<p>Who knows if they will pull out this series with the Magic? If they do, good job and more power to them. They have done more than anyone has expected of them. However, if they falter after taking the all-important Game One of the Eastern Conference finals, I will be waiting in the wings, ready to come around next year asking what their retirement plans will be with the Golden Girls in Boca.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sports columnist Julia Speace will feel really awkward if Ray Allen breaks a hip playing Bingo in Florida.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/aging-celtics-team/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/aging-celtics-team/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/aging-celtics-team/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/aging-celtics-team/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/aging-celtics-team/","id":913,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[912,911,910],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":52,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
