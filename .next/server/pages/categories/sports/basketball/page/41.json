Senior forward Sweets Underwood also contributed a double-double with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Junior guard Melissa Zornig tallied nine points and six assists as well</p>\n<p>“[Underwood and Nesbit] did a great job,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They continue to grow and that’s what we need them to do as upperclassmen.”</p>\n<p>Squaring off against the Lions in an exhibition match for the second consecutive year, the five starters for the Gauchos were returning players, including three starters from last year’s squad: Nesbit, Zornig, senior guard Destini Mason, Underwood and senior center Kirsten Tilleman.</p>\n<p>The starting five picked up where they left off at the end of last season when they won the Big West Championship, jumping out to a quick 15-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“Those first 10 minutes were as close to perfect as we’ve played,” Mitchell said. “It probably took us three or four games in the regular season to even see minor glimpses of that [last year].”</p>\n<p>The quick start came as a result of UCSB’s tenacious defense. Santa Barbara held Vanguard to 14-0 shooting to start the game and did not allow the Lions to score until the 10:17 mark.</p>\n<p>“That’s what we’re known for: the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “That’s what we expect from our kids. That’s our mindset.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s dreadful 16.1 percent shooting in the first half, Esther Timmermans tallied eight of the Lions first-half points, as the Gauchos took a 25-13 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Nicole Ballestero single-handedly rallied her team back in the second half, scoring the first seven points to bring the score to 25-20.</p>\n<p>“We started switching every screen and role, so I don’t know if there were communication mistakes, and some of it was our transition defense,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>A layup by Zornig snapped Vanguard’s streak and sparked an 8-0 run to give Santa Barbara a 33-20 lead, an advantage that would not drop below eight points the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>If there was one major weakness for the Gauchos, it was their turnovers. They tallied 18 on the night, although it was the first time the team has played together.</p>\n<p>“If you go in our locker room, the number I told them tonight that would be acceptable was 18 [turnovers],” Mitchell said. “This was our first game and if you tell the kids they can have 18 to 20 turnovers, sometimes they’ll push it more without being worried about making a mistake.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins regular season play Friday at UNLV.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/ucsb-tames-lions-exhibition-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/ucsb-tames-lions-exhibition-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/ucsb-tames-lions-exhibition-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/ucsb-tames-lions-exhibition-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/ucsb-tames-lions-exhibition-victory/","id":723,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[722,721,720],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Dominate at Home in Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB kicked off the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season with a 74-50 victory in an exhibition game over La Verne College Thursday night at the Thunderdome.

Williams led the Gauchos with 11 points in the half to build a 37-26 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Overall, 11 players recorded double digit minutes for the Gauchos as the team tried to develop chemistry between specific rotations.</p>\n<p>“If I get an open layup and I’m knocking it down, then great. But if I see an open shooter I’m going to swing it to him,” Big Al said. “That’s the good thing about this team … everybody on the floor can score. It’s about whatever the team needs and whatever coach tells us .”</p>\n<p>Starting the game for the Gauchos were freshman guard Dalante Dunklin and forward Taran Brown, sophomore forward Lewis Thomas, Williams and junior guard Kyle Boswell. Thomas was second on the team with nine points, while Brown scored five points and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I like the chemistry. When you see teams that share the ball, I think it’s good chemistry,” Coach Williams said. “The fact that we are at this stage pretty darn unselfish is a good sign to me.” With a point guard battle brewing between four players, senior Nate Garth seemed to have the best night of the bunch with five points and a team-high five assists. “This team will peak in January and February, and I can guarantee that we’ll be at the top of the Big West,” Garth said. “We’re very talented and all we need to do is learn the ins and outs and the little things of the game, and that will make big differences.”</p>\n<p>Providing a spark for Santa Barbara in the second half was junior forward Shawn Moore, who notched an impressive eight points and seven rebounds in a mere 10 minutes on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I was happy for him [tonight], because he was really struggling in practice the last couple of weeks,” Coach Williams said. “I think tonight will give him a lot of confidence. I think he did a great job during his minutes. He’s begging for more minutes.”</p>\n<p>Numerous freshmen logged playing time for UCSB as forward Mitch Brewe recorded seven points and six rebounds, while forward Sam Beeler had six points and three boards. Dunklin scored only two points, but contributed with four assists and two steals. Bryson added seven points during his time on the floor.</p>\n<p>One area of concern for UCSB was the 18 turnovers committed compared to only 16 for La Verne.</p>\n<p>“We made bad decisions, and I don’t know if it’s just first game jitters because we’ve been doing it a little bit in practice,” Coach Williams said. “It’s going to be a requirement that we get better with the basketball.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins regular season play at LSU on Nov. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48585\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-dominate-home-exhibition-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48585\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-dominate-home-exhibition-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-dominate-home-exhibition-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-dominate-home-exhibition-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-dominate-home-exhibition-game/","id":717,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[716,715,714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Young and the Restless","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After three years of the best core of basketball players the university has ever seen, the UCSB men’s basketball team will try to reload as they start the 2012-13 season.

With no established starting lineup entering the season, anyone can become the next star for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Point Guard</strong></p>\n<p>Lone senior Nate Garth and sophomore T.J. Taylor return after splitting time at the point last season. Garth (2.8 PPG, 2.4 APG) improved his shooting during the summer, a noticeable flaw in his game last season. Taylor (3.1 PPG, 1.8 APG), meanwhile, returns with his superb speed and ability to drive into the lane. Neither controlled the position last season, however, as Orlando Johnson ran the offense for the latter half of the year.</p>\n<p>Entering the fold are freshmen Dalante Dunklin and Duke DaRe. Dunklin brings a physical nature similar to Johnson’s, according to Head Coach Bob Williams, and will help the team tremendously with his tenacious perimeter defense. DaRe will see playing time as a fourth option at the point after coming to UCSB as a preferred walk-on.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know who is going to take the reins there; it’s an interesting battle,” Williams said. “We feel very comfortable about our point guard position. We think we have great depth, we have four players there who are going to play … so we feel pretty comfortable with that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Shooting Guard</strong></p>\n<p>Returning at guard for UCSB is sharp-shooting junior Kyle Boswell who shot .435 from behind the three-point line last season, good for third in the league. Boswell averaged 7.5 points per game and ranked fourth on the team in both points and minutes. Coming off the bench last season as the sixth man, Boswell was an integral part of the team, adding much-needed scoring off the bench.</p>\n<p>“We think right now, we probably have to start [Boswell] early,” Williams said. “Ultimately, we would love to be able to have the luxury of bringing him off the bench. He’s so good, such a spark, such a valuable player coming off the bench, but we have to wait and see.”</p>\n<p>True freshman Michael Bryson comes in as a talented recruit who can shoot and will likely spell Boswell at the two position, at least for the beginning of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take some time. We’re going to have some patience to let this team grow up a little bit,” Williams said. “We’re the youngest team in the country. Between walk-ons and scholarship kids, we have 11 freshmen, and you need some patience to develop that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>After battling injuries for most of last season, junior Keegan Hornbuckle returns with a starting spot most likely in hand. Hornbuckle averaged 3.6 points last season but was inconsistent throughout the year, sometimes looking like a bench player while other moments like a star caliber player. He will likely split time between the small forward and power forward spot.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got to grow up. They have to go through their growing pains,” Williams said. “It’s not going to come out and be all smooth and a bed of roses early. There’s going to be ups and downs, we’re going to look good for four minutes and bad for four minutes.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Taran Brown will look to gain action on the floor for the first time this season with a strong chance at starting at the small forward spot. At 6’8”, Brown possesses the height for the power forward position but is a talented athlete and shooter better suited for perimeter play.</p>\n<p>“It’s the idea that we have to gradually be learning, and they have to be sponges and absorbing and putting into action what they absorb,” Williams said. “They’re a talented group, we’ve got good basketball players; it’s just a matter of growing up.”</p>\n<p>Coming off the bench will be Australian sophomore Lewis Thomas, who averaged 1.1 points and 1.3 rebounds per game last season. Thomas will fill in as a backup to Hornbuckle at the four position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Big Men</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the most recognized player returning for the Gauchos is sophomore center Alan Williams, who averaged 6.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season. Half of Williams’ rebounds were on the offensive end, as he led the Gauchos in rebounds despite playing only 17 minutes a game. Williams became a starter at the end of last season and is the leading candidate once again this season to lead the team in rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to utilize Al by setting good screens and [him] being a good rebounder,” Williams said. “We have to utilize him by getting him the ball on the right place on the floor where he can be effective. He has to do a good job of playing without fouling.”</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler will spell Williams at the center position while playing power forward as well. Brewe brings his 6’8”, 242-pound bruising frame into the low post for the Gauchos and is primarily an inside player.</p>\n<p>“It’s just important that they have a confidence level in teammates and they come out and play confident,” Williams said. “You can’t play scared in the game of basketball, and if you do, you’re going to get eaten up. All of these freshmen have had a pretty high level of success in high school, so they’re all pretty confident kids.”</p>\n<p>Beeler meanwhile is 6’10” but a mere 210 pounds. In his senior season of high school, Beeler averaged seven blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“The most pleasant surprise for us is the readiness of Mitch Brewe and the readiness of Sam Beeler,” Williams said. “We feel pretty comfortable if we have to play either one of them right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins play on Thursday, Nov. 1 in an exhibition game when they host La Verne College. Without a set starting lineup, Thursday’s game will give coaches and fans alike a good look at how the team performs and potentially who will step up in live-game situations.</p>\n<p>“We’ll run people in that game in waves to get a feel for what we have. There are so many new faces and so many new people that the idea of who starts really isn’t very important right now,” Williams said. “It’s us gaining information as coaches on our players whether or not we’re getting any better with what we’re trying to do. I anticipate there will be a lot of changing lineups with the first five to eight games.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season, UCSB was ranked fifth in the preseason conference poll, an homage to the team’s recent success, but also a realization that UCSB is no longer an unquestioned member at the top of the conference with the departure of the core group of seniors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair, a pretty good compliment to our recruiting,” Williams said. “In past years, teams that won the league were picked sixth in conference. So, get some chemistry, get gelled, who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for the La Verne game is scheduled for this Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/","id":724,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[723,722,721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Champs Ready to Begin Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its quest for a second consecutive Big West title this Monday when it begins its season in an exhibition match against Vanguard.

In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish third, behind Northridge and Pacific. Nevertheless, the team did receive three first place votes.</span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Last year, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, during her first year coaching the team, turned the Gauchos into a defensive powerhouse known for their blue collar mentality. The team led the Big West in scoring defense, allowing just 52.5 points per game. With Mitchell behind the wheel, the personality of this team will remain the same. Now, the players have a better feel for the system, but what plagued the Gauchos last season was the ability to score, so if they can cut down on their mistakes and put some points on the board, their defense will always keep them in games.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Despite losing two incredible seniors in Emilie Johnson, the team’s leading scorer and point guard, and Kelsey Adrian, the team’s leading three-point threat known for her versatility, the Gauchos have a similar look to last year’s team that took the Big West crown. The team features eight returning players, including three starters.</span></span></span></span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Here’s a breakdown of this year’s squad:</span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Guards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Nicole Nesbit (junior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — Last year, Nesbit came off the bench as a solid point guard. This year, the team is hers. Nesbit has the ability get to the basket and create her own shot or create for others. She also developed a nice jumper off the dribble. Last season, Nesbit was the team’s second leading scorer (behind Johnson ) at 8.2 points per game and gave fans a glimpse of what she’s capable offensively when she tallied a career high 20 points in the semifinal game of the Big West tournament against Pacific. She also averaged 2.2 assists last season, second on the team. This season, Mitchell will look for consistency from her upperclassman.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Melissa Zornig (junior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Zornig caught fire during the Big West playoffs last year, averaging 16.7 points. She set a career high against Pacific with 23 points and her efforts were rewarded as she was named to the All-Tournament Team. Zornig’s role on this year’s team will primarily be as a scorer. With a high basketball IQ, the ability to attack the rim, and a solid three point shot, Zornig should easily improve on her 6.8 points per game she set last season. Shooting 30.9 percent from behind the arc last season, second to only Adrian, expect Zornig to be the team’s main three point threat too. However, Zornig will also take on some of the point guard responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Destini Mason (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> A starter last season, Mason is known for her defense and will be expected to guard the other team’s best guard night in and night out. She has great athletic ability, allowing her to create for others. She also has a solid midrange jump shot. According to Mitchell, Mason has improved immensely since we last saw her, playing much calmer. She has even become a leader on this team, taking the freshmen under her wing. While Mason’s contributions may not always show up in the box scores, her opponents always feel her defensive presence.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Angelei Aguirre (senior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — We have yet to see the best of Aguirre, as she spent the majority of last season out with an injury. However, Mitchell gives Aguirre the most credit for leading the Gauchos to the championship. Aguirre is the team’s most versatile player, offensively and defensively, and has the ability to play positions one through four. Offensively, she can hit the 15-foot jumper and has the ball handling skills to even play point guard. Aguirre’s greatest strength on the offensive end, though, may be her passing. However, UCSB will need Aguirre to put some points on the board. Defensively, Aguirre will share the responsibilities with Mason of guarding the other team’s best player.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Madeline Campbell (sophomore)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — As a freshman, Campbell saw limited minutes last year. However, Campbell is a hard worker who can play in multiple positions for UCSB since she has good size at six feet. When she plays, Mitchell will need her to have an attack mentality and get to rim or the free throw line. With her size, Campbell also serves as a great offensive option to post up smaller guards. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jasmine Ware (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Ware is another taller guard at 5’10’’ who Mitchell compared to Mason, with her high energy and defensive stopper mentality. Offensively, Ware owns the midrange game and will fit well into the system. Mitchell even called her on the level of a sophomore. So, despite being a freshman, expect Ware to make an impact on the team, especially as the team heads into conference.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Forwards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Sweets Underwood (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Also a starter last season, Underwood is an extremely athletic player capable of averaging a double-double every game for UCSB. Last season, Underwood averaged 7.7 points and 7 rebounds, good enough for sixth in the Big West. She also shot a high field goal percentage, ranking third in the Big West at 46.9 percent. Underwood owns a quick 15-foot jump shot, but can also post up, which is important in UCSB’s offense, where the four and five positions are interchangeable. As for improvement, Mitchell looks to see Underwood continue to develop her passing, but overall, Underwood is a huge piece of the puzzle for UCSB.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jackie Luna-Castro (sophomore) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> While Luna-Castro is listed as a forward, she played center for UCSB last year, which probably won’t change. Last season, fans saw sparks of great potential in the young freshman, like in the Cal Poly game when she earned the start. Over the offseason, Luna-Castro has worked on her strength, but what Mitchell most hopes to see from Luna- Castro is consistency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Kendra Morrison (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Similar to Adrian from last season, Morrison is 6’1’’ and another versatile player. In her time at UCSB so far, Morrison has surprised Mitchell, who said she is “better than I thought with her IQ.” Morrison is a great passer who can also post up. Stronger than Adrian, Morrison isn’t afraid to mix it up more. Expect this freshman to find minutes on the floor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Centers</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Kirsten Tilleman (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Known as a blue-collar player, Tilleman was a huge highlight last season for UCSB. As Mitchell has repeatedly stated, “we go as Tilleman goes.” As a starter, she was consistently known for her defensive play, ranking second in the Big West in rebounds at 8.4 per game and seventh in blocked shots at .9. Offensively, Tilleman is the ultimate team player and team’s best post passer. But, Tilleman became a legitimate scoring threat down the stretch of the season, averaging 9.75 points in the final 12 games. She takes advantage of the 17-foot jump shot. Playing the majority of the time on the low block last year, the Gauchos would like to take greater advantage of Tilleman’s outside game. She’s worked on leading more vocally, but Tilleman is the leader of this team.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jessica Pino (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Thus far, Pino has made her mark on the Gauchos as a hard worker and a great passer who can also shoot the 17-foot jump shot. Pino’s greatest, though, may be her size. At 6’3’’, Pino brings height to a team that was considered undersized all of last season. The Gauchos will look for Pino to be effective on the low block.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/","id":722,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[721,720,719],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Powered by Starting Five, Lakers the Team to Beat","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While the Miami Heat may be the defending NBA champion, most of the media attention at the start of this year’s NBA preseason is focused on the Los Angeles Lakers.

In what has been prematurely deemed one of the best and most important off-seasons in NBA history, the Lakers acquired two future Hall of Famers in Steve Nash and Dwight Howard. But screw that premature praise; the Lakers are going to win the 2013 NBA championship.</p>\n<p>As a Lakers fan, I am absolutely thrilled by the acquisitions of Howard and Nash and on paper, the Lakers should be the most talented team in the league and the front-runner for the championship. However, I want to give caution to both Lakers fans and haters that there will most definitely be bumps in the road. Much like Miami’s first season with “The Big Three”, the Lakers will be heavily scrutinized if they ever lose to a team at the bottom of the standings or go on a three-game-losing streak. Losses will happen; the Lakers will not break records for the most wins in one season, but this will be a supremely talented and entertaining team to watch.</p>\n<p>Miami struggled in its first season to develop chemistry, as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh all struggled to find roles on the Heat. Maybe the Lakers will have some chemistry issues to start the season, but with some of the smartest and hardest-working players in the game, the Lakers’ transition into a poised and cohesive unit should be much faster than that of the Heat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pau Gasol, Kobe and Nash possibly have the highest basketball IQ of anyone at their respective positions and Howard is a one-of-a- kind athlete at center. Kobe is no longer 25 years old. He knows he cannot continue to score 30 points a game and he will adapt to the new roster because he will do whatever it takes to win that sixth ring.</p>\n<p>The Lakers might lose a few games early in the season as they find their groove, but come playoff time, they should be the most feared squad in the league and unlike the Heat, finish the first season together as champions.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Point Guard: Steve Nash</strong></p>\n<p>Nash is one of the all-time greats in terms of passing ability and basketball IQ. He is not the most gifted athlete in the world and has never been a great defender, but his abilities on the offensive side of the ball are unquestioned. He averaged over 12 points and 10 assists a game last year. His high assist numbers will be aided by the fact that he is playing with three other All-stars. Expect Nash’s scoring average to stay relatively the same, with his assists rising by one or two a game. Nash can hit the three ball as well, an often forgotten aspect of his game that has been sorely lacking for the Lakers. Starting Shooting Guard: Kobe Bryant</p>\n<p>Kobe is obviously an all-time top-five player. His ability to score in bunches has produced some of the most remarkable performances in the history of the game. At 34 years old, he will not average the nearly 28 points per game he put forth last year. I would say 25 points is a more realistic projection for the guard, with maybe five or six rebounds and assists each a game. With all of the offensive weapons on the team, Kobe’s scoring will drop, but his assist numbers should rise. You know Kobe is hungry for his sixth championship.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Small Forward: Metta World Peace</strong></p>\n<p>World Peace is nowhere near as talented as he was during his days with the Kings and Pacers, but he is still an above average defender.</p>\n<p>Apparently motivated by the new acquisitions, he is in the best shape since his days with the Pacers. If he can perform as he did during the last month of the regular season, where he averaged over 14 points per game, the Lakers will truly have a weapon at each position.</p>\n<p>World Peace will have many opportunities for open shots and if he can knock them down and play tough defense, Los Angeles should be able to beat any team in the league.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Power Forward: Pau Gasol</strong></p>\n<p>Pau’s numbers last year were very inconsistent. He averaged over 17 points per game during the season and nearly 20 during the last month, but his numbers in the playoffs dropped off considerably at under 13 a game. With Howard under the rim, Gasol can play where he is most comfortable — 10-15 feet from the basket — and take more open jumpers. If he can replicate his performance for Spain in this summer’s</p>\n<p>Olympics, he can be one of the top power forwards in the game. When Gasol goes into beast mode, he looks like an</p>\n<p>All-star. The only problem is he lacks that consistent tenacity. Gasol should see a boost in production, as teams will be forced to pay more attention to other weapons on the offense.</p>\n<p>But the main difference between the 2010 Heat and the 2012 Lakers is the unquestioned leadership. Kobe Bryant is the leader of this team. Dwight Howard has even said he is eager to learn from Kobe and is looking forward to being challenged by the hardest working player in the game. Kobe will concede control of the offense to Nash, but control of the game is still his. The same unquestioned leadership could not be said about the Heat.</p>\n<p>LeBron and Wade often struggled in late-game situations, both fighting to be the “Alpha Dog” in the relationship. James had yet to perfect the late-game finishing touch he developed last season. At the end of a game, you know Kobe is taking the last shot if he has it; none of that passing to a backup as LeBron did with Udonis Haslem.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a position-by-position breakdown for the Lakers and the possible impact each member of the starting five will have on the team this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Center: Dwight Howard</strong></p>\n<p>The best big man in the game, Howard is an athletic freak, featuring the speed of a small forward and the power of a center. He opens up the Lakers pick-and-roll game and forces defenders to double-team him so he cannot get to the rim. He may not have a great back to the basket game, but he will have plenty of opportunities to score, especially with Nash passing him the ball. Defensively, Howard is a drastic upgrade over Andrew Bynum and gives the Lakers a defensive presence unmatched in the league.</p>\n<p>The Lake Show will play some entertaining basketball this season. If they can produce on the floor with the talent that they have on paper, this could be a team for the ages. The starting five is set, and with an improved bench consisting of Antawn Jamison, Jordan Hill, Jodie Meeks and Steve Blake, the Lakers have the talent to become champions this season as well as over the next three years.

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It was unique because I’d only had one week to work out with our current team,” Mitchell said. “We went on the road in July and we tried to get a top 10 or 12 list just by watching kids play 10 or 12 games with their AAU programs. After that first set of evaluations, we had things narrowed down and we got on the phone and started recruiting these kids like we’d been recruiting them since they were in eighth or ninth grade.”</p>\n<p>The three new recruits will have to help fill the shoes of two outstanding seniors, guard Emilie Johnson and forward Kelsey Adrian. Johnson led the team in scoring at 9.5 points per game, assisted with 2.8 per game and stole with .9 this season. Adrian averaged 6.5 points per game and served as the Gauchos’ three-point threat, leading the team in three-point percentage at 35.8.</p>\n<p>“They gave all they could to the program,” Mitchell said. “Like with all seniors, you respect them, but you move on to the next group.”</p>\n<p>When looking for players, Mitchell had one very key characteristic in mind: versatility.</p>\n<p>“They’re very versatile players,” Mitchell said. “After seeing our team play this year, people know that unless you’re 6’5’’, to me our two, three and four positions are interchangeable. They give us some height on the wings because we were extremely small at times this year and it affected us on the defensive side.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jasmine Ware</strong></p>\n<p>5-foot-10 guard Ware comes to UCSB from Sacramento High. Named the 86th-best guard in the nation by ESPN, Ware averaged 14.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.0 steals and 2.0 assists per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of coaches probably know they missed one with Jasmine,” Mitchell said. “She’s a defensive stopper. I watched her guard a 6’2’’ kid in a high school game and control the entire game with her defensive mentality.”</p>\n<p>Ware led her team to a 27-7 overall record and a 14-0 mark in league.</p>\n<p>“[Ware] knows how to win and she’s also going to bring the energy that maybe the personality of our kids didn’t have this year,” Mitchell said. “We need to continue to grow with that aspect and know it’s okay to play with a lot of emotion. Jasmine’s going to be one of those that refuses to lose.”</p>\n<p>While Ware is known for her offensive ability, Mitchell looks to take advantage of Ware’s defensive versatility, claiming she could guard positions one through four. “She’s legit 5’10’’, but she plays a lot bigger,” Mitchell said. “She’s extremely long and athletic and just lightning quick from end to end. She’ll be able to help us at times because we struggled to guard bigger, more physical guards.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kendra Morrison</strong></p>\n<p>At first look, Morrison seems very similar to Adrian. Both are versatile players, listed at over six feet tall, but play on the wing and shoot well from behind the arc with Morrison shooting at 33 percent. “Probably the biggest difference, and Kelsey did this later in the season for us to have a chance to win, is that Kendra is really physical,” Mitchell said. “She’s going to want to post at times, so [while] Kelsey came in having the reputation as a shooter, Kendra’s going to be a scorer because she’ll post up and find a way to get to the free throw line.” Last season, Morrison averaged 16.0 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, 1.5 assists and 1.7 steals per game at Eastlake High in Sammamish, Wash. With a height of 6’1”, Morrison is known as a rebounding guard who can also handle the ball extremely well.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have [sophomore Nicole Nesbit] running the point 90 percent of the time and [sophomore Melissa Zornig] will probably see some time backing her up, but I would never hesitate [to play Kendra],” Mitchell said. “Kendra’s one of those that if you ask her to play one, two, three and four, she has that ability. [She’s] just a blue- collar, ‘I’m going to find a way to win’ [player] and she’s willing to do all the team things.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jessica Pino</strong></p>\n<p>After averaging 12.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.5 blocks, 3.3 assists and 1.4 steals last season, MaxPreps named Pino the 73rd-best player in California.</p>\n<p>“It was funny because she was the first kid on campus when I took the job and her dad was her high school coach and he said she could play the one, two or three,” Mitchell said. “And we went and saw her play and watched some film and I said, ‘She’ll be a dominating four player before she’s done here because of her size.’”</p>\n<p>This 6-foot-3 forward from Chaparral High in Temecula brings height to a UCSB team that was undersized all of last season. Pino also played volleyball, and as a result is known for her athleticism and jumping ability. Mitchell expects her to also play some center.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great passer from the high post area and we do a lot of high-low action,” Mitchell said. “She’s very comfortable shooting the 17-footer or three-pointers at times. She’ll bring that length that we didn’t have.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s first recruiting class will join nine returners, including Big West Tournament MVP and junior center Kirsten Tilleman. Tilleman averaged 6.8 points and 8.4 rebounds (a team high), finding her offensive stride later in the season. In the championship, Tilleman tallied a double-double with 16 points and 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Yet, according to Mitchell, Tilleman may not be the one to step up as the leader, or at least not vocally.</p>\n<p>“I think the person who has taken a backseat her entire career that’s been a great leader for us right now is [junior guard] Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “Angelei is a little more vocal and where Tilleman is getting out of her comfort level a little more, she always leads by example.”</p>\n<p>With the looks of her team, Mitchell has high hopes for her squad next season.</p>\n<p>“They understand me and what this coach staff wants from them a bit more,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we’ll get off to a better start next season. We have an extremely difficult, tough schedule, though, (which includes UNLV, BYU, USC and Washington), so we’ll be challenged early and we’ll see our resiliency and if that prepares us for Big West play.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47113\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47113\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/","id":720,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[719,718,717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rebuild and Reload","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After losing five seniors — including three starters — to graduation this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team is best described by two words: young and inexperienced.

According to ESPN, Beeler is the No. 131-ranked power forward.</p>\n<p>“He can run and shot block at this level now,” Williams said of his tallest recruit. “He has got to get way more physical, but his upside is as good as anybody in this class — that is why we had to beat out Washington State and other bigger conference teams to get him, because it’s so hard to find bigs that can run at this level.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Brewe</strong></p>\n<p>Mitch Brewe, a 6’8” forward out of Seattle Prep in Seattle, WA, may have the best chance out of any Gaucho to make an immediate impact as a freshman.

Despite averaging just over 14 points per game in high school, Bryson attracted coach Williams with his all-around game.</p>\n<p>“He is a good shooter but a better basketball player,” Williams said. “He has got a really good basketball sense and makes a great commitment to the defensive end of the floor. He is a complete player that will only improve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Dalante Dunklin</strong></p>\n<p>Dalante Dunklin is a 6’0” point guard out of Francis Parker High School in San Diego, CA.

A strong and active player, Dunklin is a physical presence that can blow by a defender for a dunk or hold his ground defensively. With junior Nate Garth and freshman T.J. Taylor returning as point guards, it is unsure whether Dunklin will redshirt or not, and if he will be able to acquire playing time next season. “[Dalante] is way more of a physical presence than any point guard we have had recently,” Williams said. “I think he is physically ready to come in and play at this level. The adjustments will come within growing up and being a point guard in terms of leadership and all that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aamahd Walker</strong></p>\n<p>Coach Williams’ latest recruit, Aamahd Walker, committed to attend UCSB after signing a national letter of intent in early April. The 6’2” shooting guard from Culver City High School in Culver City, CA is a natural wing scorer in the mold of recently departed senior shooting guard Orlando Johnson or last year’s recruit, redshirt freshman John Green. According to ESPN, Walker is the No. 69-ranked shooting guard in the nation in his recruiting class.</p>\n<p>Walker averaged 20.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.5 steals, 3.0 assists and 1.1 blocked shots per game during his senior season. He also shot 46 percent from the field, 33 percent from three-point range and 76 percent from the free throw line. Walker’s outstanding performance led to a Second Team All-CIF selection and First Team All-Ocean League.</p>\n<p>“He is really talented offensively — a natural scorer,” Williams said. “If we don’t redshirt him, I would expect him to make an immediate scoring impact. … He made such a commitment of wanting to be here. He really had to work and change certain aspects of his academics and he worked very hard to make it happen.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the freshmen of this year’s class, UCSB will return three redshirt freshmen in 6’5” guard John Green, 6’8” forward Taran Brown and 6’1” walk-on guard Duke DaRe. The rest of the Gaucho roster is expected to be filled out by three sophomores, two juniors and a lone senior.</p>\n<p>“A lot of how we play and determining which of our freshmen will redshirt next season will depend on our bigs,” coach Williams said. “In Big Al [Williams], we have a legitimate center, but with him off the court we have to play a smaller lineup. If Brewe or Beeler can come in and contribute right away, then we won’t have to worry about catering to our big lineup and our small lineup in different situations.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46971\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46971\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/","id":721,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[720,719,718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Swept by Irvine, Drops to Fifth Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A three-day trip to face lower-ranked UC Irvine turned into a three-game series sweep for the Anteaters and two shutout losses for the UCSB baseball team.

Thurman, who holds a 2.61 ERA on the season thus far, threw six strikeouts in Friday’s series opener to add to his 6-2 record on the year.</p>\n<p>“Their pitchers did a really good job of minimizing innings,” Vertigan said. “All of our hits were spread out. We just didn’t get hits at the right times of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to put runners in scoring position four different times throughout the game, yet could not get a foot past third base. Senior Kevin Gelinas saw action in his first weekend start since February, and though the lefty gave up just two runs in the fifth inning, it was enough to hand him his first loss of the year.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game provided similar results to the first, highlighted by another 2-0 loss for UCSB. Gaucho freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez’s phenomenal performance over 6.1 innings may have been overshadowed by the loss, yet Vasquez was still able to lower his ERA to 1.69 by allowing just one run during his time on the mound.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to manage just four hits in the game, two of which came from the bat of Vertigan. Vertigan, who has twice been named Big West Player of the Week so far this season, currently leads the team offensively with a .370 batting average and a .519 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>In the closing game of the series on Sunday, UCSB was able to put players past home plate four times, yet it wasn’t enough to match the five runs scored by UCI. Gaucho sophomore inf ielder Brandon Trinkwon led all hitters in the game with four hits in five at-bats, forcing the UCI pitching staff to switch up its gameplan.</p>\n<p>“We actually got to their bullpen and were able to put some pressure on that first [pitcher],” Vertigan said. “Once we got him out of the game, it was kind of a big deal because once you get to their pen, it gets easier to get after teams.”</p>\n<p>Digging in to the Anteater bullpen for 12 hits on 38 at-bats wasn’t enough for the Gauchos to overcome Irvine’s four-run inning in the fourth, as they fell 5-4 in the top of the ninth.</p>\n<p>“We definitely pitched good enough and played good enough defense to win those games,” Vertigan said. “If we had played our game, we could’ve beaten them in all three games.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to practice this week to prepare for a three-game home series against Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/","id":716,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[715,714,713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kelsey Adrian: Clutch Canadian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"To win a championship, a team needs players who step up in big moments.

Not only were both numbers team bests, but they ranked Adrian sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey represented a ‘pro-type’ guard because she’s right at six feet,” Mitchell said. “It was easier for us to get her a shot because she’s got a quick release and because of her size.”</p>\n<p>In 62 games at UCSB after transferring from Cal, Adrian’s name is now found in the record books for total three-pointers. She finished with 100, good enough for seventh all-time.</p>\n<p>“[Kelsey’s] been my go-to player,” Johnson said. “As a point guard, you have to have that shooter, and she was that player for me. I always knew where she was on the court because she’d be ready to knock down the big shot.”</p>\n<p>Another monumental game for Adrian took place on the road against Cal State Northridge, in which UCSB won 71-67 in double overtime, proving that the Gauchos could contend with the best in the league. Prior to the game, Mitchell challenged both seniors to set the tone for their team.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted Kelsey to realize is that she’s not just a shooter,” Mitchell said. “I wanted her to be a scorer. Kelsey needed to find a way to score, whether it be rebound put backs, posting up or getting to free throw line.”</p>\n<p>Adrian responded with 17 points, tying her career high. She shot 7-13 from the field, including 3-6 from three-point land and tallied eight rebounds. Adrian’s stats weren’t just big; she made the big plays too. She hit a critical three that eventually brought the game to overtime and came up with a steal at the end to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“In that game, I knew I needed to do more for the team for us to win,” Adrian said. “I tried to be more aggressive and I think that showed.”</p>\n<p>A little over a month later, Adrian topped her career-tying offensive performance. Defeating UC Davis on the road 60-56 in a game which gave the team momentum heading into the playoffs, Adrian tallied a career-high 21 points. She shot 7-13 from the field and 4-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Since I had been at UCSB, I hadn’t beat Davis,” Adrian said. “I was not going to go out in the last game, last time playing Davis, and [lose].”</p>\n<p>Adrian’s impact wasn’t only on the offensive end. In many games, Adrian defended the opposition’s best shooter. Against Davis, Adrian was given the task of guarding the smaller Hannah Stephens, who scored 16 points, including four threes, in the first matchup. The second time around, Adrian held Stephens to just five points.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s length creates a problem [for opponents] and she doesn’t have to guard [them] as close as Emilie or Nicole,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Then, in the playoffs, Adrian made the needed plays. In the second half of the first-round matchup against UC Irvine, a late charge and trey from Adrian helped clinch the 61-51 victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because everyone asks me [if I like taking the big shots,] but during the game, I’m not thinking about it,” Adrian said. “When you’re in the middle of the game, it’s just another shot, which works for me because I’m not thinking about the time and pressure.”</p>\n<p>Then, Adrian hit another crucial three in the championship. After going down 40-41, she put a dagger into Long Beach with a three that gave UCSB a lead with 7:20 remaining, which was never relinquished.</p>\n<p>“Some players shy away from late game [opportunities], but when you put in the time, that’s why you play the game,” Mitchell said. “She has that killer instinct. We wanted somebody taking those shots that has ice in their veins and that’s Kelsey.”</p>\n<p>Adrian tallied just six points in the game, but her impact was felt far beyond the box score.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t even have to score a point,” Mitchell said. “Her steady play and calmness … she’s been there before and everyone fed off of that.”</p>\n<p>In fact, personal stats were never the priority for Adrian. It was always about the team. While her numbers were down this season, averaging 6.6 points this year compared to 9.2 last season the team accomplishments were far superior. For Adrian, a championship was the best way to leave her mark on the Gauchos’ program.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s impact goes beyond [the numbers],” Johnson said. “It makes me really happy when she puts up those huge games on the stat sheet, but she doesn’t care whether she has two points or 20. For her, all that matters is the win.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/","id":714,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[713,712,711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mitchell Recognized as Rookie Head Coach of Year Finalist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a year in which UCSB women’s basketball Head Coach Carlene Mitchell led her team to a Big West Conference Tournament Championship and an NCAA tournament birth, the first-year coach was named o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a year in which UCSB women’s basketball Head Coach Carlene Mitchell led her team to a Big West Conference Tournament Championship and an NCAA tournament birth, the first-year coach was named one of three finalists for the Spalding Maggie Dixon Division I Rookie Head Coach of the Year Award.

Ending the half on an 11-2 run, Baylor took a dominant 46-16 halftime lead and coasted through the second half.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t convert [our open shots], which put us in a hole,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “It’s hard to play a perfect game, but [when] we put together a complete game, we’re a team to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Baylor junior center Brittney Griner finished with 14 points in 22 minutes, her 75th consecutive game in double figures.</p>\n<p>“I think Tilleman did an amazing job on [Griner], but she’s 6’8’’ and she’s played with the USA team,” Mitchell said. “I give our kids credit because she had to work hard for her points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defensive game plan was to make Baylor’s role players win the game. Five players for the Lady Bears were in double figures and, as a team, it shot a phenomenal 58.7%.</p>\n<p>“The role players stepped up,” Johnson said. “When they’re shooting threes and have 6’8’’ Brittney Griner, they’re absolutely the best team in the nation.”</p>\n<p>Due to the team’s height advantage Baylor dominated the paint, outscoring the Gauchos 42-18. Junior forward Destiny Williams finished with 12 points, playing a crucial role in gaining the big first half lead. Junior forward Brooklyn Pope finished with 13 points and seven boards, making her impact in the second half.</p>\n<p>As one of the best defensive teams in the nation, holding opponents to just 30.7 percent shooting, Baylor pressured UCSB’s offense. Although UCSB committed a bearable 16 turnovers, the Bears scored 24 points off those giveaways. The Gauchos also struggled to find any offensive rhythm, suffering six shot clock violations, and failed to hit many open shots. UCSB shot 26.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They’re long and athletic,” Mitchell said. “We’ve faced teams that our guards have had a hard time getting their shots off, but you can’t emulate the speed and athleticism of Baylor.”</p>\n<p>In her final game as a Gaucho, Johnson led the Gauchos offensively with 10 points. Johnson finished in double figures in 14 of the last 17 games.</p>\n<p>“I wish I had hit more shots, but I just tried to help my team in any way I could,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Tilleman, who was matched up with Griner, also had a solid performance, tallying eight points and eight boards. Off the bench for UCSB, freshman center Jackie Luna-Castro also scored eight, a career high.</p>\n<p>“Tilleman played with a lot of confidence and was knocking down that 15 foot jumper,” Mitchell said. “It makes me excited as to what will happen next season with her leading the team.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-23/gauchos-dominated-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-23/gauchos-dominated-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-23/gauchos-dominated-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-23/gauchos-dominated-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-23/gauchos-dominated-1-baylor-ncaas/","id":713,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[712,711,710],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Face No. 1 Baylor in First Round of NCAA’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will look to pull off a major upset on Sunday in the first round of the NCAA tournament when the team takes on Baylor, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation.

Griner has averaged 9.4 rebounds and 23.3 points per game throughout the season, the latter of which is good enough for sixth-best in the country, and also tops the nation with 5.1 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll watch some films of games that maybe teams held her below thirty,” Mitchell said. “That might give us an idea of some things we can do, but we’re so undersized that it’s going to take a bit of creativity to see if we can slow her down.”</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’, Griner will have a seven-inch height advantage over UCSB junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who was named MVP of the Big West tournament with her 16-point, 11-rebound effort in the championship. Tilleman ranks second in the Big West in rebounds with 8.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“People have called me an undersized post player ever since I came to college, but I think anyone’s undersized compared to her,” Tilleman said. “It’s funny because coach [once] asked me if I would ever want to guard her and I was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’ You have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain.”</p>\n<p>With Griner leading the way, the Bears have been unstoppable offensively, averaging 78.8 points per game while shooting a nation-best 49 percent from the field. On the defensive end, Baylor dominates too, grabbing 45.7 boards and holding teams to 30.7 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to create some different problems with their athleticism,” Mitchell said. “They pick the ball up full court and wear you down. They just keep bringing athletes at you.”</p>\n<p>Another key match-up will be the point guard position. Senior guard Emilie Johnson, the leading scorer for the Gauchos averaging 9.8 points per game, will face off against one of the best point guards in the nation, sophomore Odyssey Sims. Sims averages 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[We have to] limit the role players because we know [Griner’s] going to make a difference,” Johnson said. “We know she’s going to score and we know she’s going to get some blocks, but it we limit the role players, we have a chance to be in the game.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Kelsey Adrian’s versatility at 6’2’’ should be an area in which the Gauchos could take advantage. Adrian is the team’s leading three-point shooter at 36.8 percent, and has hit at least two three pointers in eight of the last 10 games.</p>\n<p>“It’s about having the mentality that we deserve to be there,” Johnson said. “We earned our way just like everybody else and no matter the number in front of our name, we still put in the work and effort. We’re going to play hard and embrace the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 11:30 on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/","id":712,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[711,710,709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women Complete Storybook Ending With Win Over Long Beach State in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince — a Big West Championship and an automatic berth into the Big Dance.

At the end of the day, this is why you play the game–for March Madness and a chance to cut down nets.”</p>\n<p>It was a tough regular season for the Gauchos indeed. After winning the Big West a season ago, UC Santa Barbara experienced a lot of change, beginning with a new Head Coach. For a while, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>The team was not going to give up though and all season long, Mitchell reiterated that her team would peak when it mattered most in March and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors could leave. The Gauchos won nine of their last 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special. All the hard times that we went through this year…I wouldn’t trade it for this moment right now.”</p>\n<p>And as the title game came to a close, it was evident in the team the obstacles they had faced and overcame. With under a minute left, Johnson exited from her final Big West game with tears of joy and as that final buzzer sounded, the team flooded the court. Johnson, along with senior forward Kelsey Adrian, was embraced in celebration. The team couldn’t get those championship t-shirt on quicker.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way. They wanted to leave their legacy, which was a Big West Championship, so I only have to thank them for believing in me.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After taking a nine point lead to begin the second half, Long Beach took a timeout and the 49’ers responded. Freshman guard Alex Sanchez sparked a 13-3 run and the Beach took its first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading three point shooter, Adrian, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead, a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period. That would be enough to give UCSB its 14th title, the most in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“I have to thank Coach Stringer for preparing me for this opportunity, but I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship game, the Gauchos put a complete game together. They defeated Pacific 84-66 and got revenge on the team that knocked them out in the first round the year before.</p>\n<p>“We came in with a chip on our shoulder, knowing how horrible it felt last year to top the conference and lose to one of the last seeds on your home floor,” Nesbit said. “So when we came out here, we knew we had to play a solid forty minutes to get the win.”</p>\n<p>While known for playing in low scoring games, it was impossible to guess that the Gauchos were dead last in scoring. The 84 points is a season high for UCSB and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit, finished with 23 and 20 points, respectively. Both are career highs for the sophomore guards. Johnson also finished with 20 points, hitting 10-12 at the free throw line to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling a bit during season and this is the time to turn it on,” Zornig said. “I wanted to come in, step up, and do whatever I can to help this team win.”</p>\n<p>After taking a 37-28 lead into halftime, UOP immediately closed the gap to four to begin the second half. However, UCSB pulled away, tallying 47 second half points.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>With a Big West Championship and a potential run in the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos have certainly left their legacy.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45606\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45606\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/","id":744,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[743,742,741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Bring Home the Hardware","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time a No. 6 seed has ever won the Big West Tournament, as the Gauchos overcame Long Beach State 63-54, beating three teams in their journey to the title.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way.

For much of this season, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>Mitchell reiterated all season long that her team would peak when it mattered most in March, and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors, could leave.</p>\n<p>The squad responded over the past few weeks, winning nine of its final 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards, eight on the offensive end. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field through the opening 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After taking a quick nine-point lead in the second half, Long Beach responded with a 13-3 run and the 49’ers took their first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>Adrian, UCSB’s leading three-point shooter, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead that they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period.</p>\n<p>“I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship, the Gauchos had to first overcome a University of Pacific squad that had beaten them during both of the teams’ regular season meetings. UCSB’s 84 points against UOP was a season high, and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit finished with career highs of 23 and 20 points apiece, while Johnson tallied 20 of her own on 10-12 shooting from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now faces Baylor in first round action of the NCAA women’s basketball tournament next Sunday, March 18.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/","id":745,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[744,743,742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Advance to Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mens-bball-vs-Pacific_Kenneth-Song_Big-West-Tourney_3.8.2012-7750.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mens-bball-vs-Pacific_Kenneth-Song_Big-West-Tourney_3.8.2012-7750.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team hosted a party for three on Thursday afternoon at the Honda Center.

Johnson, who was recently named to the All-Big West Conference first team, shot just 1-for-3 through the first 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The long-range shooting of Boswell, combined with two three-pointers from senior guard James Nunnally, shocked the Pacific defense out of its zone coverage and into a man-to-man set entering the second period.</p>\n<p>“Guys came in hitting shots [in the first half] and it got them out of the zone,” Johnson said. “They came out man-to-man and I felt more comfortable.”</p>\n<p>Johnson awoke to the man-to-man pressure at the start of the second half by scoring 12 of Santa Barbara’s first 15 points, highlighted by a stadium-rattling windmill jam on a solo fast break.</p>\n<p>“It comes natural to me,” Johnson joked about the dunk. “That was just one of those times where I was feeling pretty good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on runs of 8-0 and 16-6 during the second period, effectively smothering any comeback opportunities for Pacific.</p>\n<p>If UCSB is able to overcome the Mustangs, they will advance to Saturday night’s Big West Tournament championship game at 7 p.m. Tip-off for tonight’s game is set for 9 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/","id":743,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[742,741,740],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":41,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
