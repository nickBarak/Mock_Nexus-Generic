The recruited players are familiar with the big moment and are ready to make an impact immediately, and they could very well compliment an experienced squad of UCSB players.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the top of the Gauchos’ recruiting class, junior college transfer and Community College Player of the Year Jalen Canty provides a much-needed presence on the block that UCSB will lack next year with the departure of seniors Beeler and Brewe.</p>\n<p>Starting all 33 games for the City College of San Francisco last season, the 6-foot-7-inch, 245-pound forward proved to be essential to his team’s success, averaging nearly a double-double with 13.1 points and 9.1 rebounds per game to help lead his team to a CCCAA State Championship.</p>\n<p>A defensive liability on the boards and versatile back-down post player, the former Washington State commit will be seeing quality rotational minutes from Williams and should mesh well with the team’s current arsenal of athletic forwards in Jarriesse Blackmon, Alex Hart and Ami Lakoju.</p>\n<p>Canty also has some ongoing chemistry with sophomore Gabe Vincent as both were former teammates on the AAU Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Among other post-man recruits for Santa Barbara is the 6-foot-8-inch senior out of Besant Hill Academy, Felix White. A candidate for the First Team All-CIF Division VI, the international forward from Nigeria has the tangible skillset and basketball IQ necessary to excel at the next level.</p>\n<p>Aside from his team-leading averages of 17.3 points per game and 10.6 rebounds per game during his senior year, White compiled a cumulative 3.42 GPA during his three years at Besant Hill. This intelligence in the classroom is a trait White hopes to translate onto the hardwood next season against much bigger, faster and smarter talent in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With Big West premiere players such as Bryson and Green sealing their legacy in a blue and gold uniform, Santa Barbara will have to anchor itself with a new core of scorers this upcoming year.</p>\n<p>Surely Vincent and junior Eric Childress will be fundamental assets to the team’s offense; however, the two Conference Honorable Mentions now have some help with a collection of new wing players seeking to make an impact.</p>\n<p>Christian Terrell, Max Heidegger, Mickey Mitchell and Clifton Powell Jr. are all incoming talents capable of stretching the floor and attacking the basket.</p>\n<p>Terrell and Powell, both 6-foot-4-inch combo wings, add to the long list of versatile two-guards under Coach Williams. Named one of the elite players in the area by the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, Terrell finished his four-year tenure at Sacramento High with a total of 1,279 points. The All-Metro conference player can be a threat on the perimeter, averaging a 35 percent shooting percentage from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Powell, a fifth-year senior out of Woodland Hills, CA has also grown in his scoring ability and lengthy frame as a result of an extra year at 22ft Prep School Academy in South Carolina. A bouncy guard with a knack for knocking down the three, both Powell and Terrell could stand as crucial second-string pieces that fill the void for key bench players T.J. Taylor and DaJuan Smith.</p>\n<p>In addition to these shooting guards are floor generals Heidegger and Ohio-State transfer Mitchell. Heidegger, a 6-foot point guard from just down the road at Oaks Christian, fits in a somewhat smaller category of Division I players, yet his ability to drive, kick and finish at the rim makes him an ideal player under Williams’ guard-oriented system.</p>\n<p>Though transfer regulations will force the 6-foot-7-inch Mitchell to redshirt this upcoming season, the combo forward could possibly have a substantial role in the future with three full years of eligibility remaining at UCSB.</p>\n<p>As the six seniors continue onward to their next phase in life, another set of basketball talent looks to carry on this culture of excellence and mold a new identity for the UCSB men’s basketball team. With pure skill meeting a hungry squad unsatisfied with last year’s Big West Semifinal loss, Williams and his crew might have more of a rewarding season than expected heading into early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 26, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/","id":336,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[335,334,333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season Ends, Decline in Second Half Leads to 64-49 Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MBasketball_vsUCI-20150228-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MBasketball_vsUCI-20150228-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite entering halftime tied 24-24, the UCSB men's basketball team was unable to contain Old Dominion's 40-25 scoring run in the second half and were defeated 64-49 on Tuesday evening.

Guard Gabe Vincent then closed the half on a three-pointer of his own tying the game up at 24 apiece.</p>\n<p>Vincent and Bryson led UCSB at the break combining for 14 points. Senior Mitch Brewe also contributed scoring seven of his nine points in the first period in 10 minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stormed out the gates in the second half as Vincent drove to the rim for a layup and Bryson hit a three to give UCSB its final lead of the game, 29-27, with 17:37 remaining. It was beyond this point in the game in which the Monarchs took control.</p>\n<p>Assembling a 13-2 run, Old Dominion guard Aaaron Bacote scored 10 straight points to give his team a 39-31 edge with 12:58 to play. Averaging 17.8 points this month, the senior finished with a game-high 26 points in the Monarchs’ victory. Bacote scored 21 of his points in the second half, including a 3-6 performance from behind the three.</p>\n<p>A three pointer from Vincent in the 10<sup>th</sup> minute helped cut Santa Barbara’s deficit into single digits at 37-46, but Bacote responded with a three-pointer of his own to put Old Dominion back up by a dozen.</p>\n<p>Trey Freeman made an impact Tuesday night as well. The redshirt senior finished with a double-double, scoring 18 points and racking up 10 rebounds. This was Freeman’s ninth-straight game with 17 or more points.</p>\n<p>The Monarchs outshot UCSB in the second half going 13-26 from the floor and outscored the Gauchos by a margin of 40-25. Turnovers were a deciding factor Tuesday as well as Old Dominion converted 19 points off Santa Barbara’s 14 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Bryson led the way for Santa Barbara with 17 points. Named to this year’s All-Big West team, the senior passed Chris Devine for sixth place all-time in school history with 1,620 points. Bryson also finished among the top ten in blocked shots, free-throw percentage, and will end his collegiate career as UCSB’s all-time leader in three-pointers made with 241.</p>\n<p>Despite a knee injury sidelining him in his final game Thursday night, redshirt senior John Green ends his collegiate career with an average of 10.8 points per game. Playing only 61 games, the Oakland native finished with 658 points, 270 rebounds, and 87 assists.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler finished with career highs in his final year. Starting all 33 games this season, Beeler tallied in 220 points and 153 rebounds. The forward, from Poway, also scored in double-figures seven times this year, including a 16-point performance Monday night against Northern Illinois.</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and Mitch Brewe all served as dependable components to UCSB’s second unit averaging a combined 10.1 points off the bench. The trio recorded 329 points, 195 rebounds, and 94 assists on the year.</p>\n<p>In spite of a bitter ending, the Gauchos won 10 of their last 13 games to close out the season, registering the second longest winning streak in team history with 9-straight wins.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/gauchos-season-ends-decline-in-second-half-leads-to-64-49-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/gauchos-season-ends-decline-in-second-half-leads-to-64-49-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/gauchos-season-ends-decline-in-second-half-leads-to-64-49-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/gauchos-season-ends-decline-in-second-half-leads-to-64-49-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/gauchos-season-ends-decline-in-second-half-leads-to-64-49-loss/","id":335,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[334,333,332],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Postseason Win Since 1990, Face ODU Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 13-3 run to end the game led to the UCSB men's basketball team to its first postseason victory since 1990 in its 70-63 win over NIU Monday afternoon.

The Huskies drew ten fouls on the Gauchos in the first half hitting 12-17 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>NIU’s junior guard Aaric Armstead led the way with 12 points and went a perfect 4-4 behind the free throw line. Grabbing down ten rebounds and finishing with a double-double, the third year from Chicago, Illinois failed to register a bucket in the second half.</p>\n<p>Following two converted free throws from freshman forward Jarriese Blackmon to put UCSB on top 19-18, the Huskies compiled a 25-9 run reclaiming the lead and ended the first half with a halftime lead of 43-32.</p>\n<p>A turnover from guard Eric Childress opened up the second half and led to a go-ahead layup from Travon Baker. This gave Northern Illinois its largest lead at 13 points.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the sloppy start, the Gauchos regrouped and responded with a run of their own.</p>\n<p>Off the Baker layup, Eric Childress went coast-to-coast and finished with a finger roll which trimmed NIU’s lead back to 11.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to chip away at the Huskies’ lead as Vincent connected on a free-throw line extended jumper followed by a three-point make from senior Michael Bryson, his second of the night. UCSB regained some momentum and cut the deficit to single-digits, 39-45, with 17:15 left in the game.</p>\n<p>The Huskies continued to battle however in the 11<sup>th</sup> minute as 6’10 forward Marin Maric knocked down a pair of free throws and intercepted a pass from freshman Maxwell Kupchak.</p>\n<p>Maric then found his teammate Marshon Wilson for an easy transition layup maintaining a six-point lead at 52-46. Wilson was a spark for the Huskies’ second unit as the freshman shot 6-11 from the field and finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>With NIU up six points approaching nine minutes to play, the Gauchos assembled their most important run yet.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara pulled away in the final minutes, producing a 13-3 run to end the game.</p>\n<p>Senior Sam Beeler played an effective part in this, racking up 10 of his total 16 points with eight minutes to go including a 15-foot baseline jumper that extended his teams lead to 63-58 with 3:26 left.</p>\n<p>The senior concluded the game with an 8-9 shooting performance, helping UCSB seize its first postseason tournament victory since defeating the University of Houston in the first round of the 1990 NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face Old Dominion in the semifinal round of the Vegas 16 Classic.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 75-59 over Tennessee Tech, the Monarchs are on a streak of their own having won eight of their last nine matchups. Senior guards Aaron Bacote and Trey Freeman combined for a total of 34 points in ODU’s win Monday night.</p>\n<p>Tip off for tonight’s matchup will begin at 6 p.m. in the Mandalay Bay Center. The game will also be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69170\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69170\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-29/gauchos-earn-first-postseason-win-since-1990-face-odu-tonight/","id":334,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[333,332,331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Back in Action, Take on NIU in Vegas 16","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite not earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the 2015-16 season continues for the UCSB men's basketball team as it will face NIU in the first round of the Vegas 16 Tournament this Monday.

Coming off a 79-62 loss to Ohio University, NIU heads into Mandalay Bay Center with a respective record of 21-12 overall and 9-9 in the MAC.</p>\n<p>Winners of nine-straight before its semifinal loss in Anaheim, UCSB has proven itself as a team capable of finishing strong. Moreover, Santa Barbara has found its spark offensively in the month of March, shooting 48.5 percent from the floor and outscoring opponents by 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the opening round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara shot 54 percent and went 11-23 from the three-point line in a 26-point victory (87-61) against UC Davis. This matched UCSB’s largest margin of victory against a conference opponent this year.</p>\n<p>While their offensive efficiency has been a concern for opposing teams, the Gauchos’ strong play can also be accredited to a pestering defense that is currently +7 in the turnover margin and averaging 15 or more points off turnovers over a four-game stretch.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Eric Childress has become a vital contributor to this tenacious defense recording a career-high six steals, four in the first twenty minutes of play, in Santa Barbara’s loss to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>With solid performances on both ends of the court, Santa Barbara’s second unit has relieved some pressure in tight situations and been an aid in closing out games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have increased their bench production to nearly half of the team’s total points, 30.3, during this month. While coming up short in their last game, the second unit of UCSB outscored the Warriors’ bench 26-14 commanded by forward Alex Hart. The second year player out of British Columbia, Canada had his best performance yet scoring 13 points in nine minutes of play, trimming a 21-point Hawaii advantage to eight in the second half.</p>\n<p>This mixture of hard-nosed defense, streaky shooting, and bench support will be key ingredients for Head Coach Bob Williams and his team heading into their match against NIU.</p>\n<p>As for fifth year Head Coach Mark Montgomery and his Northern Illinois Huskies, they will rely on a talented core of underclassmen to propel their way to victory. A starting lineup that features two freshmen and one sophomore, the Huskies are a scrappy yet disciplined team that can compete against experienced squads.</p>\n<p>NIU ranked second in the MAC conference this year allowing just 67.1 points per game. With 6’10 forward Marin Maric and All MAC-Defensive Player Aaric Armstead down low, this duo will try and stymie shooters like Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent from getting good looks and driving to the basket.</p>\n<p>While the Huskies finished ninth in the MAC in terms of shooting production, 72.7 points per game, look for an even distribution of scoring by Montgomery’s starters to carry the load offensively.</p>\n<p>Four out of five starters are currently averaging double-figures in scoring for Northern Illinois with Maric leading the pack at 12.1 ppg. The redshirt sophomore from Croatia has tallied home 14 double-doubles on the year, including two 22-point performances this season.</p>\n<p>In the backcourt, senior Travon Baker will be the primary player that the Gauchos’ defense will attempt to contain. NIU’s all-time leader in steals with 181 and second in school history with 355 assists, Baker is a savvy guard who can draw double teams and open up opportunities for his teammates.</p>\n<p>Guards like Vincent and Childress must do a good job keeping Baker in front and limiting his playmaking ability.</p>\n<p>Tip off between the Gauchos and Huskies will take place at 4:30 p.m. CT, 2:30 p.m. PT. The matchup will be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/","id":333,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[332,331,330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season Ended in 88-76 Loss to Hawaii in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a historic ending to the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team saw its nine-game winning streak come to an end in its 88-76 loss to Hawaii Friday night in the Big West Conference Tourna...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a team-high 22 points from senior Michael Bryson, a 24-3 run opening the second half helped the University of Hawaii to defeat the UCSB men’s basketball team by a final score of 88-76 in the Semifinals Round of the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68937\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68937\" data-attachment-id=\"68937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/michael-bryson-pushes-the-ball-to-his-teammate-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Michael Bryson pushes the ball to his teammate.

The newly crowned Big West Player of the Year connected on four of his first five shots, including two early threes, which handed Hawaii a 14-9 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Mizzou-transfer finished with 24 in points and seven rebounds in 31 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Warriors managed to extend their lead to 10 points as senior Aaron Valdez scored six straight points starting with a dunk assisted by forward Sai Tummala with 8:47 to go in the first.

This was also Valdez’s third straight game with 18 points or more.</p>\n<p>Following a 27-17 outpour by Hawaii, Santa Barbara responded with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>Guard Gabe Vincent helped turn things around scoring seven points in the final four minutes of the first period.

The Stockton, CA native shot 46.7 percent from the floor for 17 points. Santa Barbara finished 9-2 in conference play when Vincent shoots above 40 percent, both losses coming to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>While UCSB only trailed by three heading into the break, the Gauchos were unable to halt Hawaii’s 21-3 run ignited by senior guard Roderick Bobbitt.</p>\n<p>Connecting on three straight three-pointers to open up the second half, Bobbitt scored 12 of his total 21 points in the final 20 minutes of play helping Hawaii maintain its lead. The Oakland point guard contributed distributing the ball as well tallying four of his five assists in the second period and grabbing at total of six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A big margin of difference lied in Hawaii’s field goal percentage and trips to the line. The Warriors shot 52 percent from the floor as well as hitting 27-37 free throws. Santa Barbara, a team who has shown consistency at the line, finished 16-27 from the free throw line. The Gauchos also took 10 more shots than Hawaii, going 26-60 from the floor, but finished with 43.3 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Alex Hart gave a much needed boost off the bench for UCSB. The sophomore forward finished with a career-high 13 points, shooting a perfect 3-3 from three-point range. Eric Childress also played a role on the defensive end. The junior guard finished with a career-high six steals, four of which came in the first half including three-straight steals with six minutes to go.</p>\n<p>However, the efforts of both players would not be enough to prevent the Rainbow Warriors from securing their 88-76 victory. Hawaii will attempt to win the conference championship in hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2002.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/","id":330,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[329,328,327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Extends Streak to Nine Games, Face No. 1 Seed Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"A 87-61 rout of UC Davis in the opening round of the Big West Conference Tournament advanced the UCSB men's basketball team to the Semifinals set to take place Friday.

It was the fifth straight game in which the Gauchos never trailed.</p>\n<p>Hitting a three-pointer during the first drive of the game, sophomore guard Gabe Vincent set the tone for his team. The former Big West Freshman of the Year finished with 20 points off 8-12 shooting. Vincent’s defensive presence aided the Gauchos as well, recording two steals including one off Davis’ guard Darius Graham leading to a fast break dunk.</p>\n<p>Quality offensive possessions in the first half were the determining factor for UCSB. The Gauchos went 16-30 from the field, 53.5 percent, in the first period and were able to move the ball around the perimeter and knock down open shots. Head Coach Bob Williams’ first unit was on point tallying 32 of the team’s 42 points in the first half.</p>\n<p>Senior Michael Bryson played a large role in this, going 6-8 from the field and scoring 16 of his team-high 24 points before halftime. The All-Big West guard also hit five three’s in the game, knocking down four of these in the first 20 minutes including back-to-back perimeter shots with 6:42 and 6:00 to go. This was Bryson’s ninth game of the season with 20 or more points.</p>\n<p>The Aggies showed some resilience however, as a miscue from senior T.J. Taylor led to a fast break dunk from guard Lawrence White which brought the score to 26-20. Santa Barbara then responded, taking a 16-3 run to finish out the first half with a 42-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ scoring attack remained persistent in the second half. With a 20-point advantage, guard Eric Childress drove to the left side of the rack and converted on a nifty reverse layup.</p>\n<p>The junior had a full stat line finishing with nine points, four rebounds, three steals, and a game-high six assists. Santa Barbara is now 9-4 on the year when Childress averages five or more assists.</p>\n<p>Senior John Green was effective off the bench for UCSB as well. The forward recorded his fourth-straight double figure performance with 14 points and five rebounds. Green is currently averaging 15.2 points per game in the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos outhustled the Aggies in rebounds, second-chance points, points in the paint, and most significantly bench points with Williams’ second unit winning the battle 27-5. Overall, UCSB shot better from the field finishing with a field goal percentage of 54 percent to Davis’ 42 percent and connected on 11-23 shots from three-point range.</p>\n<p>In hopes of keeping the game within reach for the Aggies, Bryton Lemar and Siler Schneider carried the scoring load for UC Davis. The two finished with 16 points apiece.</p>\n<p>The true freshman Schneider stepped up big for the Aggies, playing 32 minutes and shooting a perfect 4-4 from beyond the arc.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Sophomore guard Makala Roper led UCSB in scoring with 20 points on 7-18 shooting overall and 3-8 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UC Davis advances to the Semifinals and will face Big West Conference regular season champion UC Riverside this Friday at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos recorded a season-low nine turnovers and matched Davis in field goals made at 24, their 11 extra shot attempts did not benefit them as their 38.7 field goal percentage was surpassed by the Aggies’ 47.1 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>In her postseason debut, redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch led the Aggies’ efficient shooting with a career-high 26 points on 11-16 shooting, tying her career best in field goals made. Her career-high in scoring is the most in a Big West Tournament game by a UC Davis player.</p>\n<p>Bertsch’s career night started early as she scored five points in the Aggies’ 11-4 run to open the game, forcing UCSB to call a timeout. She went on to finish the quarter with nine points while shooting a perfect 4-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Unable to contain the Aggies’ offense, UCSB’s issues continued on the offensive end as well. Able to only score in spurts, the Gauchos concluded the period down 10-20 after a 4-16 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Despite its shooting woes to begin the game, Santa Barbara improved in the second quarter shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from behind the three-point line, and 100 percent at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>An 8-3 scoring run to begin the second period helped UCSB to trim Davis’ lead to five at 18-23. But the Aggies regained their double figure lead after a made three-pointer by sophomore forward Pele Gianotti. Finishing tied with senior forward Celia Marfone for second in scoring at 15 points apiece, Gianotti went 4-9 shooting the ball and was 2-5 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Trailing by 12, Santa Barbara prevented Davis from extending its lead with an 8-2 run prior to entering halftime. Back-to-back three-pointers by senior guard Dioseline Lopez and Roper in the remaining 2:09 of the second quarter cut the Aggies’ lead to 34-28. Topping off the Gauchos’ run was sophomore forward Taylor Farris with a layup as UCSB entered the half trailing 30-36.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second half, Santa Barbara extended its scoring stretch to a 14-5 run.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge in the third quarter was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller with a combined total of 13 points on 4-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>With its lead only at three, UC Davis responded with a 7-0 run of its own to recapture another 10-point lead at 46-36 to force a Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB answered with a 13-4 run to close out the third quarter, capturing its first lead of the game at 49-48 after a made free-throw by Jemerigbe. But the Gauchos’ lead would only last for six seconds as Davis’ sophomore guard Rachel Nagel made a jumpshot to give the Aggies a 50-49 lead before starting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>While it was a strong ending for UCSB in the game’s final period, shooting 46.7 percent from the field in addition to eight points by Roper, Davis’ scoring arsenal of Bertsch, Gianotti, and Marfone was nearly unguardable.</p>\n<p>The trio scored 19 of the Aggies’ 21 points in the quarter, shot 7-10 from the field, and 2-2 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>A total of seven lead changes occurred in the final 10 minutes of Wednesday’s game. With 1:50 remaining in regulation, a three-pointer by Marfone increased the Aggies’ lead to four to 68-64.</p>\n<p>After calling a timeout, the Gauchos’ top three-pointer shooter in Roper responded with a clutch three of her own to reduce UC Davis’ lead to 68-67.</p>\n<p>Similar to Santa Barbara putting the ball into the hands of its best player, the Aggies did the same in getting the ball to Bertsch in the paint.</p>\n<p>In spite of the play call not succeeding and UCSB gaining possession, UC Davis’ defense managed to hold its ground forcing a turnover with the shot-clock violation to lead itself to victory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/","id":329,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[328,327,326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West Tournament against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team will attempt to continue its historic end to the season in its Quarterfinal game versus UC Davis in the Big West Conference Tournament.

Since then, Santa Barbara has swept teams such as Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside, and upcoming opponent UC Davis during this tenured win streak.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there were a lot of people that believed when we were 3-5 we’d move back to the upper echelon of the league,” UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Our team has definitely responded well [following this start].”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this essence of hot streaks towards the end of the season is nothing new for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos ended Big West play last year on a five-game winning streak finishing against notable teams such as then first seeded UC Davis, third seeded UC Irvine, and fifth seeded Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Despite ending this season on such a good note, Santa Barbara does face some challenges when matching up against UC Davis. The Aggies host some offensive threats in Neal Monson, Josh Fox, and Darius Graham.</p>\n<p>Although not as effective in the Aggies’ two losses to UCSB during the regular season, Monson has been relatively efficient as of late, averaging 16.5 points in the past two games. In his third year at UCD, Monson is coming off a career night last Saturday against Cal State Northridge in which he registered his third double-double of the season with 21 points and 15 rebounds. These were both team-highs as Monson helped propel the Aggies in their 87-83 triple overtime win on the road.</p>\n<p>The duo of Fox and Graham will also be key for the Aggies against Santa Barbara. Fox, this year’s All-Big West Second Team honoree, has been a reliable scorer for Davis. The senior forward has proven to be dangerous down low scoring 20 or more points on six occasions this year as well as tallying double-figures in scoring in 21 games this season.</p>\n<p>Fox recorded 17 points in his last outing against Santa Barbara, going 8-15 from the floor along with seven rebounds. His ability to maneuver his way into the paint and take quality shots can be attributed to his versatile scoring capabilities as he ranked sixth in the conference with a 51.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe will have their hands full containing both Fox and Monson in the frontcourt as they will attempt to deny the Aggies’ interior attack and hope to limit Davis from scoring easy points in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior Darius Graham is another central component to Davis’ unit. Awarded this year’s Big West Hustle Player of Year, it is Graham’s tenacious effort at both ends of the court that makes him a vital piece to the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>While Graham is only one of three Aggies who averages double figures in points, alongside Fox and junior guard Brynton Lemar, it is his motor and willingness to scrap for loose balls that sets him apart from the rest.</p>\n<p>Aside from Graham’s gritty demeanor on the floor, the third year player has proven to be a threat from beyond the arc. In his last two games against the Gauchos, Graham has hit 6-10 shots from behind the three-point line including a 3-4 performance from downtown in the Aggies’ 72-66 home loss to UCSB on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Williams will rely on the shooting core of Michael Bryson, Gabe Vincent, and John Green to propel his team to victory.</p>\n<p>The three have been the most consistent for UCSB, averaging more than half of the team’s points— scoring 42.7 of the Gauchos’ 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>After missing six games this season due to a knee injury, three of which were during conference play, the redshirt senior is coming along nicely. Green is shooting an efficient 53 percent from the field during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</p>\n<p>“[John] has had great support around him,” Williams said. “He is a very strong man and drives through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.”</p>\n<p>Green has scored in double figures five times during the team’s current eight-game winning streak, including a team-high 14 points to go along with 10 rebounds on senior night in the Gauchos’ 69-50 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“[We’re playing] with more discipline, but at the same time just having more fun,” Green said. “We’ve been trusting each other more. I’ve always said that it’s not what matters in the beginning of the year it’s what matters in early February and late March. It’s really clicking for us right now during the best time of the year.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff between UCSB and UCD is set for 12 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. The Quarterfinal matchup between Santa Barbara and Davis will air on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/","id":331,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[330,329,328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Advance, Face No. 4 Seed UC Davis Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 62-43 first round victory over UC Irvine Tuesday night handed the UCSB women's basketball team its first postseaosn victory since the 2012-13 season.

Staying active for Irvine in the opening period was junior forward Mckenzie Piper with four of her eight points and five of her eight rebounds occurring during the period.</p>\n<p>However, Irvine was held scoreless for the remaining 5:37 of first quarter as UCSB went on a 5-0 run to close out the quarter with a tied score of 12-12.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to begin the second quarter with the first point of the period being at the 6:49 mark from a made free-throw by UCSB freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Newton managed to provide some offense in the paint with six points in the quarter but was matched in points by UCI junior guard Irene Chavez. The Anteaters’ leading scorer with 11 points, Chavez scored six of Irvine’s 10 points in the quarter but could not prevent UCSB from entering halftime with a 25-22 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes and two ties occurred during the third quarter. Tied 34-34, a layup by sophomore guard Makala Roper handed UCSB a 36-34 lead heading into the game’s final period.</p>\n<p>While the Anteaters recorded their best shooting percentage of 38.5 percent in the third quarter, they faltered in the fourth with a 15.8 field goal percentage to end the game.</p>\n<p>As UCI was plagued by its shooting woes, UCSB registered its best shooting performance of the game with a 52.6 shooting percentage in the final quarter. At the helm of the Gauchos’ late surge was Ware with 10 points to help lead UCSB to its 62-43 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to punch its ticket to Anaheim tonight with a matchup against No. 4 seeded UC Davis at 8:30 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/","id":328,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[327,326,325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 Seeded Gauchos to Face No. 8 Seeded UCI in First Round of BW Tourney Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a 2-27, 2-14 conference finish last season, the UCSB women's basketball team will make its return to the Big West Conference Tournament as the No. 5 seed set to face No. 8 seeded UC Irvine this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Tuesday marks the beginning of the 2015-16 Big West Conference Women’s Basketball Tournament.

The Gauchos last won the conference tournament during their 2012-13 run, in which they made history as the lowest seed (sixth) in Big West history to win the championship.</p>\n<p>Due to splitting its regular season series with Cal State Fullerton, who also finished with a 1-15 conference record, it was by virtue of winning a coin flip that UC Irvine clinched the eighth seed.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season with a 4-26 overall and 1-15 conference record, the Anteaters may be able to capitalize on their home advantage. But, this home advantage isn’t a guaranteed benefit for UCI after finishing with a 2-11 home record and ending the season on a 10 game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, contributing to its losing slump were two losses to UCSB as the Gauchos achieved a season sweep of the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In two meetings this season, Santa Barbara defeated UCI by a combined point differential of 23.5 points.</p>\n<p>For the most part of this season, losses by a double-figure margin has been the tale for the Anteaters. They’ve managed to lose by a single-figure differential just three times this season and even allowed 126 points in a loss to Sacramento State in December.</p>\n<p>While statistics prove that UCI isn’t a great offensive team, shooting around 34 percent in both overall and conference play, UCSB’s defense has done an exceptional job all season long, especially against UCI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 63.1 average. Their stout defense improved in conference play as well, finishing second in the rankings allowing 61.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing a 40.4 field goal percentage in the first meeting, Santa Barbara forced 22 turnovers in the game and outscored the Anteaters 31-13 in points off turnovers to go along with 11 steals. The Gauchos continued their defensive dominance in their second matchup against UCI, limiting the Anteaters to a field goal percentage of 31 percent (18-58 shooting) and 14.3 percent from behind the three-point line. They held UCI to four points in the second and fourth quarters in the same contest.</p>\n<p>Still, just like any team in the country this postseason, UCSB cannot underestimate the Anteaters’ potential to pull off an upset Tuesday night. After making the decision to forgo her senior season, junior forward Mokun Fajemisin will be looking to make an impact in what could be her final game.</p>\n<p>UCI’s leading scorer and rebounder with 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, Fajemisin also leads the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 per game. She is coming off 16 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks in the team’s 76-70 loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will also face the Big West’s top playmaker in senior guard Raelyn Cheung-Sutton. She led the Big West in assists per game with 5.7. Cheung-Sutton remained consistent in conference play, averaging 5.5 helpers per contest. She enters Tuesday after registering a season-high 17 points and tying her career-high total of 12 assists in the loss to UCD.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s backcourt will deal with the task of containing Cheung-Sutton’s vision on the court, an improvement in play by sophomore guard Makala Roper is essential if the Gauchos plan on making a run this postseason.</p>\n<p>After starting in just six games her freshman season and averaging 6.5 ppg, Roper emerged as UCSB’s top scorer in her second year leading the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Enhancing her increase in scoring was her range from beyond the arc. During the regular season, Roper ranked fourth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 38.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, as the Gauchos enter Tuesday 1-3 in their last four games, Roper has struggled during this span as well. She scored 10 points once during this stretch of games along with registering just two points in 19 minutes of play in the team’s final game at Hawaii last Thursday.</p>\n<p>But Roper’s ability to embrace the role placed upon her this season did not go unnoticed as she earned All-Big West Honorable Mention honors on Monday.

UCSB also shot 6-12 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did a pretty good job of shot selection and getting ourselves to the rim,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[Cal Poly] had an uncharacteristically bad shooting night from three and that gave us some separation in the game. We didn’t live at the three point line, we had some patience about getting the better shot and that’s when I think we’re a better team.”</p>\n<p>Never trailing at any point in Saturday’s game, it was the Gauchos’ fifth time in the last six games in which they led from start to finish. Santa Barbara has also held its opponents to a 35.8 shooting percentage during its eight-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward John Green had arguably his best performance of the season. Leading the Gauchos’ second unit, Green finished his final home game in dramatic fashion tallying in his first double-double of the year with a team-high 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Being able to bring John off the bench has been an unbelievable benefit to this team,” Williams said. “How efficient John has been the last two weeks takes us to a whole other level. People have to guard everywhere on the floor.”</p>\n<p>An uphill battle for last year’s Honorable Mention, Green missed all but four games his first three years under Coach Williams. Battling a series of foot, wrist and knee injuries, the redshirt senior has worked his way back to health and emerged as a major vocal point off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I look at my [injuries] as a learning experience,” Green said. “I just want to be a living testament for people and let him know that if you really love something don’t quit on it.”</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.7 points per game in the last three games, all of which he has led or come second on the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe had a strong senior night performance as well. The two combined for 17 of UCSB’s 20 points in the paint along with six rebounds apiece. After a few stagnant possessions on offense, Beeler beat his man down the lane and connected on a go-ahead dunk from freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak giving the Gauchos a 53-42 lead. This provided UCSB with much needed momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun playing especially when [me and Mitch] are productive,” Beeler said. “We work against each other every day so it’s great to see that work pay off for the both of us.”</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor and Dajuan Smith played some quality minutes and made an effect around the perimeter. Smith also contributed five points of his own, including a three-point shot from the top of the key with 11:59 to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly made a late push with 5:23 to go off a made three-pointer by guard Taylor Sutlive. The Gauchos quickly responded however, as Green dished a no-look pass to Brewe for a layup to give UCSB a seven-point advantage. From then on, Santa Barbara went 5-6 from the free throw line to finish out the game.</p>\n<p>Gabe Vincent helped seal the deal for the Gauchos. With just 34 seconds left in regulation, the sophomore guard pulled up from the top of the key rising over Minnesota-transfer Josh Martin and drained a shot from beyond the arc. Vincent tied Green’s performance registering 14 points as well.</p>\n<p>Senior David Nwaba led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a team-high 15 points while going 9-13 at the free-throw line along with grabbing nine rebounds. Nwaba was Cal Poly’s primary offensive target the first time these two teams faced, scoring 16 points in the Mustangs’ 76-73 loss at home on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>In addition to their regular season sweep of their Blue-Green rival, the Gauchos clinched the fourth seed in the Big West Conference Tournament. UCSB will face UC Davis in the Quarterfinal round. Tip-off will take place at 12 p.m. on March 10 at the Honda Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/","id":325,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[324,323,322],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Soar in 2nd Half to Defeat UCR 81-55, Host Cal Poly Saturday for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=851%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A new record was etched into UCSB men's basketball history as the Gauchos tallied their seventh consecutive Big West victory in a season with their 81-55 victory over UC Riverside Thursday night.

The Highlanders are in a three-way tie for fifth-place between UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara converted on three of its first four possessions, opening the game with a 6-0 run. Riverside Head Coach Dennis Cutts quickly called a timeout, benching his starting lineup for a fresh five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on the Highlander’s second-man rotation, jumping out to a 14-4 lead. Freshman forward Jarriesse Blackmon scored five of his career-high nine points in the first five minutes of the game, taking a pass from guard Gabe Vincent and connecting from three with 17:29 to go.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous [taking the starting job], but I also understand that I have to be ready when my name is called,” said Blackmon. “I was fortunate enough to have it called in the beginning of the game and bring that same type of energy I had starting the season.”</p>\n<p>Blackmon has started three-straight games for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following a 14-4 run dealt by the Gauchos, Riverside battled its way back. Freshman center Menno Dijkstra made his presence known in the paint. The 7’0” footer tallied in all 10 of his points in the first half going a perfect 5-5 from the floor.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gentrey Thomas also scored all 10 of his points in the first period including a nifty finger roll which put the score at 35-38 with 1:39 remaining prior to halftime.</p>\n<p>After an even first half, the Gauchos came out with a sense of urgency moving out to a 21-3 run. Michael Bryson took control scoring 11 of his game-high 19 points in the second half. Bryson was 4-4 from the floor in the second, including a go-ahead alley-oop from teammate T.J. Taylor which put the score at 65-45 with 8:39 to play.</p>\n<p>“It was a great pass,” said Bryson. “Watching [T.J.] throw it in the air, I thought it was going to be bad but I was able to go up and get it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had other weapons in support of Bryson’s performance. Seniors Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green all played their part in yesterday’s win scoring 26 of Santa Barbara’s bench points. Gabe Vincent had an effective night as well adding 11 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to match up with us right now because we’re so deep,” Bryson said. “Everybody that comes in is contributing something. It’s a tough road for anyone who meets us in March.”</p>\n<p>Green was the main catalyst off the bench scoring 14 points in 21 minutes as well as hitting a season-high four three pointers. Prior to Thursday’s match, Green came off a season-high 19-point performance in Santa Barbara’s win against Cal State Fullerton Feb. 27.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to focus on making shots when my opportunity comes, so during the game I can put them up, follow through, and make sure it goes in,” Green said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 29-55 for the game as well as shooting 50 percent, 12-24, from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara’s offense hit its stride, its defensive presence helped to set it apart in the second half. After allowing a 46.7 shooting percentage in the first period, UCSB held the Highlanders to a 21.4 field goal percentage in the second half. They shot 6-28 from the field, including 2-14 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“The difference [in the game] was we were really good defensively in the second half,” Williams said. “Our effort night in and night out has been better. Our activity level has to stay high on the defensive end in order to be where we want to be.”</p>\n<p>Michael Bryson, Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green will play their final home game this Saturday, March 5 as UCSB takes on rival Cal Poly. This stands as an opportunity for the seniors to leave their final imprints in a blue and gold uniform.</p>\n<p>“[This moment] will be bittersweet,” said Green. “Senior night will be a big day for us. I just want to make sure the six seniors including myself build a legacy here and create history for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently on a four-game winning streak against Cal Poly. Tip-off between the Gauchos and Mustangs will be at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome. An honorary ceremony for the seniors will take place following the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/","id":324,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[323,322,321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season-Lows in Shooting Lead to Rough Ending for Gauchos, Lose 59-45 at Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In attempt to upset Hawaii on its Senior Night, the UCSB women's basketball team fell short in its worst shooting performance of the season.

Hawaii improved to 18-10 overall, 11-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Hawaii’s shooting was senior guard/forward Destiny King going 5-6 from the field as she nearly notched a double-double with 13 points and a game-high nine rebounds. She also managed to tally three steals in the team’s Senior Night matchup while junior point guard Briana Harris led all scorers with 15 points.</p>\n<p>Although freshman guard Coco Miller registered a team-high 13 points, the rest of the Gauchos’ offense struggled as no other player finished in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded buckets to begin the game, ending the first quarter tied at 13 apiece. Combining for 12 of Santa Barbara’s 13 points in the period was Miller and senior guard Jasmine Ware with six points each. King managed to keep the Rainbow Wahine in contention with six points in the opening quarter as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it was free-throw shooting that sustained the steady swap of points between the two teams. UCSB ended the first half 7-10 at the free-throw line while Hawaii made 6-13 attempts, resulting in the Rainbow Wahine’s 26-21 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>While Hawaii managed to get to the free-throw line in the third quarter as well, complementing the Rainbow Wahine’s foul shooting was their 55.6 shooting percentage in the period. With five minutes remaining in the quarter, Hawaii embarked on a 14-2 run to end the third with a 44-31 lead.</p>\n<p>Trailing by double-figures, UCSB trimmed Hawaii’s lead to single-figures at the 2:59 mark of the final period off a pair of free-throws by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>However, restraining Santa Barbara’s comeback was its cold shooting hand as it recorded its worst field goal percentage of the game in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>In spite of going 9-10 at the free-throw line, the Gauchos shot 2-12 from the field and 1-5 from behind the three-point in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCSB’s shooting struggles, Hawaii’s second half improvements shooting the ball continued. The Rainbow Wahine concluded the final stretch of Thursday’s contest with a 54.5 field goal percentage on 6-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>In addition to recording season-lows in overall and three-point field goal percentage, the Gauchos also tied their season-low total of five assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB will await the outcome of Saturday’s game between Hawaii and Cal Poly in order to know what seeding it will earn in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a Cal Poly loss, Santa Barbara could secure the No. 5 seed. If the Mustangs were to win, they would be tied with UCSB at 8-8 in conference play. Since both teams split the pair of games they had against each other, the No. 5 seed would be rewarded to Cal Poly for having a better overall record.</p>\n<p>Currently tied for the No. 2 seed with Long Beach State, Hawaii faces a similar situation. A win over Cal Poly and a loss by the 49ers could help them to secure the seed. However, if neither team loses a game on Saurday, LBSU will be rewarded the No. 2 seed due to it possessing a greater overall record.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Tournament will begin Tuesday, March 8 at 6 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/season-lows-in-shooting-lead-to-rough-ending-for-gauchos-lose-59-45-at-hawaii/","id":353,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[352,351,350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos To Close Season at Home with UCR and Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team has won six straight games over conference opponents and will look to extend its streak against UCR and Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following an 80-62 victory at Cal State Fullerton last weekend, the UCSB men’s basketball team hopes to extend its six-game winning streak to eight games as it will host UC Riverside tonight and Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Winning builds an adrenaline level, and I think our adrenaline [for games] has been good,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve been playing much looser, harder and made major improvements defensively.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68785\" style=\"width: 909px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68785\" data-attachment-id=\"68785\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/gabe-vincent-shuffles-toward-the-hoop-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent shuffles toward the hoop.

UCSB has beaten all of its opponents by double-figures during its six-game win streak.</p>\n<p>After starting the year with a conference record of 2-4, the Gauchos have matured from their rough start gaining some valuable momentum as they near the Big West Tournament. Coach Williams accredits the team’s solid play to its tough matches against Long Beach State and Hawaii early in its conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“We came out absolutely flat [for Hawaii and Long Beach],” Williams said. “We were humbled by [these losses] and have come out with a much greater sense of urgency.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson will certainly pose as a mismatch on offense for Riverside, gradually coming into his own during the Gauchos’ winning stretch.<br>\nBryson, who earned himself his second nomination as the Big West Player of the Week this year on Monday, propelled the Gauchos to victory last Saturday after scoring a team-high 19 points.</p>\n<p>Connecting from deep five times on Saturday, the fourth-year starter broke James Powell’s record for the most three-pointers in school history, moving to first all-time with 223. Bryson now has 1,523 career points, just 57 shy of seventh place all-time for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bryson’s recent shooting stroke will enable Williams to run spread sets on offense, keeping defenses discipline beyond the arc. The 6’4” guard is currently shooting 61 percent from three in his last two games.</p>\n<p>Bryson, who leads the conference in scoring with 18.5 points per game, has scored double-figures in 25 of 26 games this season.</p>\n<p>As for Head Coach Dennis Cutts and the Highlanders, junior forward Secean Johnson will be the go-to guy on offense. After dismissing All-Big West forward Taylor Johns from the team for undisclosed team violations, Johnson has embraced a larger role for Riverside down in the post.</p>\n<p>Now seeing an increase in minutes, the junior transfer is averaging 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in his last two games, contest in which Johns was inactive.</p>\n<p>Johns, last season’s All-Big West First Team honoree, averaged 15.5 points and 7.5 rebounds this year for UCR.</p>\n<p>For Saturday night’s game, the Gauchos must contain seniors Reese Morgan and David Nwaba. Morgan is coming off two career games, scoring 23 points against Cal State Northridge and dropping another 22 in his senior night game against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be another defensive concern for UCSB. The Santa Monica College transfer led the Mustangs in their last outing against Santa Barbara, scoring a team-high 16 points to go along with nine rebounds. Look for Bryson to be matched up with the 6’4” Nwaba as he uses his frame to slash his way to the rim.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also honor seniors Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, John Green and Michael Bryson on Saturday. Williams expects an intense crowd and rowdy atmosphere to be a central component in propelling his seniors to victory.</p>\n<p>“We hope it gets rowdy [on Saturday],” Williams said. “Our seniors deserve it — they’ve had really great careers here and it’ll be great for the student body and community to pay tribute to these kids.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game begins at 7 p.m. The Blue-Green rivalry will be reignited Saturday, March 5 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/","id":352,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[351,350,349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ending Season at Hawaii, Possible No. 5 Seed at Stake","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In hopes of securing the No. 5 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, the UCSB women's basketball team will hope to overcome Hawaii as the Rainbow Wahine look to lock the No. 2 seed.

We have to be able to start a game and play with that type of energy and motor to be successful.”</p>\n<p>Currently in fifth-place of the conference standings, the Gauchos enter tonight’s game with an 11-18 overall and 8-7 Big West record. Their current total of eight conference wins is the program’s most since the 2012-13 season, in which UCSB finished with 11.</p>\n<p>After nearly handing conference undefeated UCR its first league loss over the weekend, Hawaii will attempt to improve its 17-10 overall, 10-4 conference record.</p>\n<p>It’s a pivotal final two games for the Rainbow Wahine as they are currently tied with LBSU for the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s pursuit of the No. 4 seed has deterred in the past two weeks, the Gauchos will hope to lock down the fifth seed with a win tonight and a loss by Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, who will face Hawaii this Saturday.</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can look ahead to the postseason, its offense will hope to overcome its inefficient shooting start in its first matchup versus Hawaii.</p>\n<p>It begins with the Gauchos’ pair of sharpshooters—sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. While they each managed to sink key three-pointers in the fourth quarter of the first game, more will be expected from the two tonight.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the team’s first meeting versus Hawaii with six points on a 2-14 overall and 1-8 shooting performance while Miller went 2-9 from the field and 1-3 from beyond the arc for five points. As of recently, Roper has been plagued by turnovers, finishing with four or more in UCSB’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Both will look to shake their latest shooting slumps as well as Miller has not scored in double-figures in the last three games, while Roper has done so just once during the same span of contests.</p>\n<p>“We were really impatient and undisciplined about trying to drive it and get to the rim on the first side,” Henrickson said. “You have to make the defense move and switch sides, that’ll help both of those two. The fact that we were driving it downhill on the first side and not making the defense work that turned into bad shots and no offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the majority of this season, Coach Henrickson has reassured that the Gauchos’ defense is their best source of offense. UCSB’s testament to defense will be tested tonight as it will attempt to contain senior guard/forward Destiny King.</p>\n<p>King leads the Rainbow Wahine as their only double-figure scorer averaging 10.6 points per game. She scored a game-high 17 points in the first meeting against UCSB, scoring 12 in the second half while finishing 9-12 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is her versatility when not shooting the ball that makes her into such a vital component for Hawaii. She also leads the team in steals with 32, is tied for the team lead in assists with 64, and is second on the team and ninth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 6.1 average.</p>\n<p>Just last week, King became the 11<sup>th</sup> player in Hawaii program history to record career totals of 1,000 points and 500 rebounds. She is currently nine assists away from becoming the fifth Rainbow Wahine player ever to register career totals of 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, and 250 assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to match her effort and intensity on the glass and get her off the glass,” Henrickson said. “You can’t underestimate how hard she plays, you look at her free-throws, and she has 12. You’re getting to the free-throw line because you’re driving it, rebounding it, running in transition, and getting opportunities on the block. In all of those areas is where she got us.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara prepares to face the conference’s top rebounding team, which averages 41.8 per game, the post presence of junior center Je Zhe Newton will be important for the Gauchos at both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>In 26 minutes of play in the first matchup versus the Rainbow Wahine, Newton tallied a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. However, she has not scored over three points in five of the team’s last seven games despite grabbing 12 rebounds in the Gauchos’ 58-55 loss to LBSU.</p>\n<p>“She brings size, there’s no doubt about that” Henrickson said. “She’s got to work to catch the ball and get position where she can receive the ball and finish. Certainly we have to find her; she’s got to protect the rim and defensively rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game of the season at Hawaii will tip-off at 9 p.m. PST and 7 p.m. HST</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/","id":351,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[350,349,348],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":20,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
