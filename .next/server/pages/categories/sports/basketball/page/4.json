For a small market team like the Sacramento Kings, the task is nearly impossible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the lure of a large market or a history of success, the Kings will almost never have a realistic shot of landing a big-name free agent. Even Al Horford — a second-tier free agent — turned down a massive four-year offer from the Kings, opting to take less money and join a proven contender with the 76ers.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given these limitations, it’s no real surprise that the Kings received little to no media attention during the offseason; after all, the NBA is a superstar-driven league, and the Kings were (predictably) unable to grab one this offseason. But under the radar, the Kings may have had one of the smartest free agencies in recent memory, setting the team up for success in the coming years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of overpaying for a second-tier superstar, the Kings bet that their current core of De’Aaron Fox, Marvin Bagley III and Buddy Hield will take another step forward this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his jump shot is still inconsistent, Fox showed off the tantalizing skill set last year that made him the No. 5 pick two years ago. Fox averaged 17.3 points per game and 7.3 assists per game but — perhaps most importantly — shot an impressive 37% from behind the arc. If teams start to respect Fox’s jump shot, he can utilize his athleticism to get to the hoop at will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hield, meanwhile, did his best Steph Curry impression last year, leading the team with 20.7 points per game while shooting 42% from three. One of the best pure shooters in the NBA, Hield should again provide excellent floor spacing for the Kings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being the most raw of the three, Bagley showcased his versatility and athleticism last year while only playing 25 minutes per game in his rookie season. Even without an effective jump shot, Bagley averaged almost 15 points per game — thanks in large part to his willingness to run the floor with Fox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still a superstar league, last years’ Raptors proved the importance of depth in making a postseason run. With the skill sets of these three in mind, the Kings made a myriad of shrewd signings to provide the team with the talent and depth necessary to compete in a loaded western conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Kings locked up Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $85 million contract. Considering the five-year, $180 million contract Tobias Harris signed with the 76ers, this deal feels like an incredible value. Somehow, Barnes is still only 27, and in his 28 games with the Kings last year, he shot the three at almost a 41% clip. With his athleticism and size, Barnes can guard multiple positions, making him a valuable defensive asset. Most importantly, the contract is front-loaded, meaning that the Kings will have the necessary cap space to resign their big three when they hit free agency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Barnes, all of the Kings’ free agency moves revolved around creating a solid bench unit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dewayne Dedmon is a stretch five who averaged almost 11 points for the Hawks last year, displaying a natural shooting touch that should create space for the Kings’ athletic guards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trevor Ariza is a veteran who has proven his worth time and time again, and while he struggled last year with both the Suns and the Wizards, he should be more engaged on a much more competitive team. Only two years ago, Ariza proved his worth on the Rockets, and his size and acumen make him an above-average defender, as well as a solid veteran to mentor the younger players on the roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, while the signing may not be attractive, Cory Joseph will provide the Kings with a steady hand to run the second unit when Fox needs a breather. Joseph will never put up gaudy numbers, but his 3.9:1 assist-to-turnover ratio from last year shows his reliability and willingness to find open teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caveat for these moves, of course, is the abundance of talent in the western conference. Even with their newfound depth, the Kings will have to battle just to make the playoffs in one of the deepest conferences in recent memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Kings made all the necessary moves to compete as a small market team. If Fox, Hield and Bagley can take a step forward, there is no reason this team can’t make the playoffs next year and even compete in a seven-game series against a top team.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

the playoffs this year was an oftentimes laborious task. Even with a big man like Kevon Looney switched onto him, Paul struggled to get to the hoop, demonstrating the lack of explosiveness that comes with 14 years in the league and a litany of soft-tissue injuries along the way. Save for his performance in game six against Golden State, Paul truly looked like a shell of his former self in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll also be the first to admit that CP’s contract is an albatross, with the aging guard due nearly 120 million dollars over the next three years. While it was a deal that general manager Daryl Morey had to make at the time, it will also severely limit the Rockets’ financial flexibility in the near future.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, I was shocked to see the reaction from the media when reports came out that Chris Paul had requested a trade from the Rockets after several fights with superstar James Harden. Nearly every report I read blamed Paul for the scuffles, claiming that Paul didn’t know his place on the team and was the reason for the Rockets’ inability to advance to the NBA finals the last two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear: the main disagreements between Paul and Harden stemmed from Paul wanting Harden to be involved off-the-ball and from Paul’s desire to run more set plays instead of isolation sets on offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the life of me, I can’t understand how Paul is in the wrong in this situation. Clearly, Paul recognizes he has lost a step on the offensive end, and rather than try to play iso-ball, he wants to run the offense like a traditional point guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in the worst year of his career, Paul averaged nearly 16 points and more than eight assists per game in the Rockets’ offense. While Paul’s athleticism and finishing may be in decline, he still has elite vision and basketball IQ. If Morey and Harden could get over their egos, there is absolutely no reason Paul can’t thrive at the twilight of his career. Before his back injuries, Steve Nash averaged more than ten assists per game as a 38 year old, and Paul and Nash have comparable playstyles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there is no question that James Harden is an elite isolation player — undoubtedly the best in the NBA. In the regular season, that will allow you to put up historic numbers, as we saw with Harden’s streak of 32 straight 30-point games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the postseason, with defenses keying in on you, it becomes much more difficult to just iso your way to a bucket. When Harden didn’t iso in the postseason, the Rockets’ offense had no flow — in large part due to his lack of effort off-the-ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Harden’s style had been successful in past postseasons, I would argue that Paul should co-opt his style to allow Harden the freedom he needs on offense. But it simply hasn’t garnered results in the postseason. Everyone likes to harp on Paul’s choking in the postseason, but let’s not forget that it was Harden who was benched in the 2015 postseason, and Harden who couldn’t win either game six or game seven after Paul went down last year with an injury against Golden State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than likely, Chris Paul will not be traded. While he is still a very effective player, he is quite obviously being overpaid with his contract, and few franchises will be eager to overpay for an aging, oft-injured point guard. In other words, Paul and Harden need to figure this out now, especially with the west wide open this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, Houston needs to adapt its system to allow for both Paul and Harden to do what they do best. The reason Carmelo Anthony is no longer signed with an NBA team is because he was unable to recognize that his game needed to change as he got older. In a lot of ways, Paul has already done the hardest part by acknowledging that he isn’t the same player he used to be and that he can’t just take turns running isolation with Harden. Now, the Rockets need to do the same and create a system that maximizes the talents of this version of Paul and Harden. If they can do that, there is no reason this team can’t win the title.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

But for Toronto Raptors’ superstar Kawhi Leonard, the past 10 months have been some of the most agonizing any NBA player has faced in the modern era. Forget 10 months; 10 days is all it took for the beloved San Antonio forward to have a fall from grace previously unseen in not just the NBA but the sports world altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decorated superstar had come into the 2016-17 season as a top candidate to win the MVP race. The face of the franchise, Tim Duncan, had announced his retirement the summer leading up to the season, thrusting Leonard into the forefront of Spurs basketball </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an organization synonymous with class and poise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season culminated with a Western Conference matchup against the Golden State Warriors, after dominating the Grizzlies and the Rockets 4-2 each. The fateful Game 1 in Oracle haunts Spurs fans to this very day. With a commanding 23-point lead in the third quarter, Leonard went up for a shot to add to his 26 points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only to have Warriors center Zaza Pachulia make a dirty closeout leading to Leonard leaving the game. The 23-point lead the Spurs had built up to this point disintegrated and the Spurs would go on to get swept 4-0, with Leonard unable to play the rest of the series.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the plan was for Leonard to make his return after the preseason. However, his debut in the 2017-18 season was repeatedly pushed back until Dec. 12. He went on to play nine games that entire season, citing continued pain in his quadricep as preventing his return. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here’s where everything takes a turn. Leonard was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendinopathy by the Spurs’ medicalstaff. Tendinopathy is essentially a catch-all term for any issue with a tendon from soreness to a tear to a degenerative disease. Leonard had been cleared for play repeatedly throughout the season by the Spurs’ medical team. However, due to lingering pain, he elected to get a second opinion and was then diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion, which is internal bleeding of the muscle susceptible to calcification. Leonards refusal to play despite being cleared by the team’s medical staff in favor of a second outside opinion caused tensions to arise within the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coaches and players started putting pressure on Leonard through the media, and the basketball world sided with them. At the time, very little to almost no information was known to the public. It is still unknown what the final diagnosis on the injury is to this day. In light of the lack of information, the media and fans sided with the Spurs, which had been a model of how a top-class organization should be run from top to bottom for almost 30 years until this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard was vilified and ridiculed by the basketball world. Prominent media members like Skip Bayless accused Leonard of crumbling under the expectations of filling Tim Duncan’s shoes, while others began to question his character as a person altogether. A very clear divide had formed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one where it was Leonard versus the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to rebuild trust with the Spurs organization and fans, Leonard requested a trade. Leonard had two years under contract left and had expressed explicit interest in going to LA to continue to grow his brand and career. Knowing this, very few teams were willing to part with assets that matched the talents of a player as decorated as Leonard. I mean, a two-time defensive player of the year and Finals MVP doesn’t just come every draft </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they’re once-in-a-generation type players, but only getting such a player for one guaranteed year turned many teams away from making a deal with the Spurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto Raptors General Manager (GM) Masai Ujiri is not your regular GM however and despite knowing all that he knew, he took a wild gamble. The Raptors had lost to LeBron for four straight years, even though they built their team to match up specifically against the Cavaliers. After yet another upsetting elimination at the hands of James, Ujiri pulled the trigger to trade their franchise star DeMar DeRozan and roleplayer Jakob Poeltl for Leonard and Danny Green. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto was ridiculed for taking such a gamble </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giving up a young All-Star in return for a superstar who had played nine games the prior season due to injury and was set on moving to LA in the near future. Nonetheless Ujiri made the controversial move, which has paid off greatly this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Raptors effectively locked down the second seed, not just in the East but the NBA as a whole behind Milwaukee. After making quick work of the Orlando Magic in 5, the Raptors faced the 76ers who were widely thought to have the best starting five after the Wariors. This series went to Game 7, and with the game on the line, Leonard ripped the hearts out of every Philly fan by hitting a series-ending game winner over Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto found themselves matched up with the best team in the NBA: the Bucks. After going down 0-2, Toronto rallied behind Leonard  to pull out a win in double overtime. Toronto went on to win four straight after losing the first two games to get to where they are today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard has come a long way from his initial fall from grace, and now stands on the verge of carrying the torch of best player in the world in the post-LeBron era to come in a few years. Now, he is less than seven games away from redefining not just his career but the NBA balance of power as a whole with the crucial 2019 free agency looming. But for now, NBA fans are all anticipating the redo of the matchup stolen from us by that injury two years ago.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/","id":1151,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[1150,1149,1148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Finals Preview: Warriors Offense Vs.

Both Kevin Durant, known as KD, and DeMarcus Cousins, known as Boogie, went down with a calf strain and a torn left quadricep, respectively, while Andre Iguodala has been dealing with a calf injury as well.</p>\n<p>When Durant in particular went down with his injury in game five of the second round of the playoffs, hope was at an all-time low amongst the Golden State Warriors fans when it came to the prospect of winning their third-straight championship. Fast forward two weeks, the narrative has now shifted to “The Warriors don’t need KD.”</p>\n<p>How have the Warriors been able to win without their big guns? There are a couple players that have kept them on the right track.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Stephen Curry. After KD’s injury, Curry has averaged 36 points, seven assists and eight rebounds per game. More impressively, he is shooting 47% from the field, including 41% from behind the three point line.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why Steph has been able to play at this high of a level is because he is constantly moving without the ball. As soon as he crosses half court, he swings the ball to one side and immediately goes to the other.</p>\n<p>Once on the other side, he comes off of a couple screens, similar to how a running back follows his blockers. This has made it difficult for opposing teams to guard Curry, as their primary defender at the beginning of the play is never the one that is guarding him one-on-one toward the end of the shot clock. Usually, it is a power forward or center that is forced to switch onto him, giving Curry a tremendous advantage.</p>\n<p>The second player, who has had arguably the most impact on the team during this run, is Draymond Green. Green is averaging 15 points, eight assists and 11 rebounds in his last five games. More importantly, he has been the anchor on the defensive end of the floor, whether that be drawing charges or contesting shots.</p>\n<p>Golden State is starting to revert back to their fast-paced style, which led to a 73-9 record in the regular season just two years ago, prior to the arrival of KD and Boogie. It is clear that their confidence is growing and that the older members are trying to prove that they can still win despite the injuries the team has suffered.</p>\n<p>If  Durant and Cousins do end up returning at some point in the NBA finals, it will be important for Head Coach Steve Kerr to continue to push this fast paced offense.</p>\n<p>This style of play allows players such as Klay Thompson to be not only more involved in the game plan, but also remain engaged throughout the game.</p>\n<p>While it is a luxury to have isolation scorers such as KD, it should not change the strategy that has been working recently. The Warriors are harder to guard now because every player on the floor is either moving without the ball or setting screens for their teammates.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to watch whether the Warriors play a different style if their star players return in time during the finals. That being said, Curry and Draymond will look to send a message to the league that their squad is more than capable of winning the finals regardless.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Toronto Raptors have fallen behind in each series they’ve played so far during these playoffs and have been forced to dig deep into their bag in order to successfully pull each one out (maybe the Orlando series wasn’t that tough, but you get what I’m saying).</p>\n<p>Whether they were tasked with disrupting Joel Embiid or Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nick Nurse’s squad has adjusted well and relied on their defense to lead them to victory.</p>\n<p>The Raptors are led offensively by the future Hall-of-Famer Kawhi Leonard, but at points throughout the playoffs some of their main scorers and playmakers have shown their inexperience (Pascal Siakam) or shown that they are Kyle Lowry (Kyle Lowry).</p>\n<p>Marc Gasol is also no longer the dominant offensive presence that he once was, and guys like Danny Green and Fred VanVleet are not the kind of multifaceted threats that can consistently make a difference in the playoffs. It is in times like these that Nurse’s squad must rely on their lengthy and disciplined defense to propel them to win.</p>\n<p>The defensive dominance of the Raptors’ playoff run can easily be characterized by their opponents’ shooting percentages, as they have allowed the second lowest field goal percentage (41.7%) and the third-lowest three-point percentage (31.3%) out of all the playoff teams.</p>\n<p>Interestingly however, they have allowed the fourth-highest percentage of three-point shots to be taken against them (40.5%). These stats put together show that Toronto is exceptional at forcing teams out of shots near the hoop and making them take bad, highly contested shots from behind the arc. This is a strategy that worked wonders for them against Milwaukee, as their length bothered Antetokounmpo on his drives and forced him to  kick the ball out to shooters at the three-point line, who were then forced to shoot under duress as the Raptors’ length also allowed them to recover and contest those shots.</p>\n<p>Toronto’s exceptional defense has only improved in the playoffs, as their 102.8 defensive rating through 18 postseason games is sizeably better than their 107.1 regular season defensive rating.</p>\n<p>This is most likely due to the fact that Nurse has cut down his rotation to only his most productive players, and also because Leonard is now playing every game, which he did not do throughout the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Raptors have been known for having a strong bench with a deep rotation of quality players, but throughout this season and aided by the Marc Gasol trade, it has been the starting lineup that has set the tone on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In fact, the starting lineup of Leonard, Gasol, Green, Lowry and Pascal Siakam has a playoff defensive rating of 99.7 over 314 minutes played. This is the only five-man unit of the playoffs to have a defensive rating under 100 and have over 200 minutes played. Since this unit has been on the floor for over 300 minutes, it has allowed the Raptors to achieve sustained dominance over the course of several grueling playoff series.</p>\n<p>Defense will be key against one of the best offensive teams ever — Golden State — and with KD likely missing time early in the series, the Raps might have the personnel to slow down the Splash Brothers and make this series interesting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

However, as the old sports adage goes, it’s defense that wins championships and one Warriors player especially stands out in this field.</p>\n<p>Draymond Green’s legacy doesn’t only end at three-time NBA Champion, three-time NBA All-Defensive First Team and the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year — but it does give you a good idea of his elite repertoire.</p>\n<p>Green is known around the league for his fiery passion and explosive play on the court, especially as of late when considering his recent string of performances in this year’s playoffs. Notably so, he’ll be entering the Finals series in fine form as he’s coming off a spectacular Western Conference Championship performance against the Portland Trailblazers, where he tallied 16.5 points per game, almost nine assists and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>This ability to show that he can produce on both ends of the court makes Green a significant X-Factor that the Toronto Raptors must take into account. Not to mention, he may have a good shot at Finals MVP — that is, if the next X-Factor doesn’t suit up in time for this series.    <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant</strong></p>\n<p>As the current all-around best player in the league, Kevin Durant is someone who needs very little introduction. Still, his status for the NBA Finals may be in question as he’s been dealing with an apparent hamstring injury that’s kept him sidelined since the second-round series against the Houston Rockets; Golden State has already confirmed he will not be ready in time for game one in Toronto.</p>\n<p>At first, the media expected Durant’s injury to be much worse than it turned out to be, with diagnoses like an ACL tear being projected. However, recent reports have brought concern down to merely a hamstring injury which offers him a chance to return to action for the Warriors very soon.</p>\n<p>But this only begs the question of if his return may in fact hinder Golden State’s chances considering the team is 31-1 in their last 32 games with Curry and without Durant. Still, Durant’s presence should without a doubt bolster his side’s attack and offer another set of clutch hands if a win is on the line in the late-game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless, these X-Factors’ potential storylines will make this 2019 NBA Finals one of the most highly anticipated championships in recent memory and will surely give basketball fans everywhere a spectacular show.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toronto Raptors just made the NBA Finals for the first time in their franchise’s history. This is fantastic for Raptor fans; however, they are going to have to beat the Golden State Warriors, the team competing in their fifth straight finals. Does Toronto have any chance of dethroning this star-studded superteam? Obviously guys like Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry will have crucial roles in the outcome of this series, but for the Raptors, who else is going to step up to stop the Warriors? This best of seven will most likely come down to a few key players taking their game to that next level, on the NBA’s biggest stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first potential X-Factor of this series is Kyle Lowry. The 12th year veteran out of Villanova took a lot of scrutiny early in these playoffs for his Game 1 performance versus the Orlando Magic. Since that game, he has been playing extremely efficient, averaging 14.7 points per game and with a 45% shooting percentage. Along with his scoring, Lowry has been facilitating the Raptors’ offense, averaging 6.4 assists per contest. Coming into this Finals, Lowry will face his toughest challenge yet, defending Steph Curry. Although the Warriors can score in a variety of ways, their offense is at its best when Curry is playing well. If Lowry can pester and harass Curry to force him out of the groove, then the Raptors could have a legitimate chance.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto’s next potential game changer in this series, is Fred VanVleet. Since the birth of his second child on May 20, VanVleet has been shooting the lights out. In the 15 playoff games prior to his sons arrival, VanVleet was not turning heads, only averaging four points per game and hitting just 19.5% of three-point attempts. Since May 20, VanVleet has broken out, now averaging 16 points per game and has nailed 82.4% of three-point attempts. If Fred VanVleet can continue this hot shooting streak, the Raptors’ chances improve dramatically in this series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key component to Toronto’s success is found within Pascal Siakam. Having to most likely matchup with Warriors forward, Kevin Durant, Siakam is going to have to be extremely active on the defensive end of the floor. Luckily for him, Siakam is 6’9’’, with a 7’3’’ wingspan and moves like a guard. Hopefully he can put all of his length and quickness to work when trying to contain Kevin Durant. In these playoffs, Siakam has been scoring very profficently, averaging 18.7 points per game on 45% shooting. The Raptors will need Siakam to continue to produce for them on both ends of the floor if they want any shot at winning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some athletes often think that seasons are won or lost based off of certain players within the team. This isn’t the case in the NBA Finals. Championship series are never won by one single player. Every year, the NBA Finals is won by the best team. With that, if the Toronto Raptors want any chance of hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy, it is going to take an overall collective effort. The starters all the way to the last guy on the bench are going to have to step up to put a stop to the Warriors’ reign. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/","id":1149,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1148,1147,1146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Finals Preview: Curry’s Legacy and the Bench Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/basketball.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/basketball.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Steph Curry has always been the most important player for the Warriors, and his impact since Kevin Durant has gone down has been immeasurable.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both fans and media personalities questioned whether or not the Warriors would even make the Finals, believing that they had lost the series against the Houston Rockets the moment Durant went down with his injury.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Warriors relied on their star point guard who would drop 33 points, all in the second half of Game 6, to put away the Rockets and advance to the Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>Yet, even after Curry’s Game 6 performance, many doubted he could lead the Warriors past the scorching Portland Trailblazers who upset both the media favorite Oklahoma City Thunder and second seed Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>NBA Hall of Famer and TNT Analyst Charles Barkley predicted that the Trailblazers would make the Finals, and even went as far to say “the Warriors have no chance of winning without Kevin Durant.”</p>\n<p>Curry’s legacy has been in question since Durant joined the Warriors, which caused his scoring to take a minor drop.</p>\n<p>As such, analysts and fans believed that Curry’s time as the greatest point guard in the NBA has gone, having been surpassed by Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, to name a few.</p>\n<p>To silence his naysayers, Curry played monstrously in the Conference Finals averaging 36.5 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in a 4-0 series rout of the Blazers to reach the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>The Warriors will be in the Finals for the fifth straight time being only the second team to do so, since the Boston Celtics, led by Bill Russell, did back in the ‘60s.</p>\n<p>Curry has played the previous four, but has never won an NBA Finals MVP. While Curry has mentioned that he prefers to win the championship over the award, it’s precisely his lack of a Finals MVP that people question his legacy.</p>\n<p>With Durant out for the first game and possibly the second (or longer), it’s up to Steph Curry to once again carry the load and remind the rest of the NBA why he was the first to ever be awarded MVP unanimously.</p>\n<p>This is Curry’s opportunity to showcase his offensive arsenal and prove to the world that the Warriors are still his team.</p>\n<p>Curry has a chance to once and for all shut up his critics, and claim the award that’s rightfully his.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Between Leonard, Lowry, Curry and Thompson, the NBA Finals has more than enough all-stars to keep an eye on this Thursday. Besides these players and the rest of the Raptors’ and Warriors’ starting lineups, however, is a bench full of players equally crucial to securing a championship ring.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the Toronto Raptors have been known for having a deep bench and relying heavily on rotations. But, as we know, this year is not like the rest for the Canadian franchise. As showcased in the Eastern conference finals, Coach Nick Nurse has stuck to a steady eight-man rotation, which includes Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka and Norman Powell.</p>\n<p>Most outstandingly, the trio’s combined 48 points during Game 4 against the Bucks attests to their newfound place in the Raptors’ lineup. Powell and VanVleet make up the first- and second-highest marks in three-point shooters off the bench in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Since the birth of his second child prior to Game Four, VanVleet’s performance has improved greatly. Coincidence or not, his average three-point percentage over Games 4, 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals stands at 85.9% —  significantly higher than it’s been all season — going 3-3, 7-9 and 4-5, respectively. His recent success may even open up a spot for him as starting point guard in the upcoming finals.</p>\n<p>Serge Ibaka’s defensive game has been consistent for the Raptors come postseason. With his steady inside coverage, mobility and acute eye for rebounds, the 6’10” center can be very useful going against a strong offensive team like the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Norman Powell’s minutes and shooting percentage from the field have nearly doubled since the conference semifinals back in the beginning of the month. Powell will enter the NBA Finals this Thursday on a hot streak after marking a lofty 74 points during the Eastern Conference Finals — a tremendous improvement to the mere 21 points he tallied in the semifinals.</p>\n<p>As for Golden State, their bench remains a bit more unpredictable. After a calf injury took out Kevin Durant back against the Rockets, the Warriors have had to lean on their bench more than anticipated this postseason. Now giving more starting time to players like Kevon Looney, Coach Steve Kerr relies more heavily on bench rotations; consequently, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko and Shaun Livingston have been spending more time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the conference finals against Portland, McKinnie really stepped up his game. Though inconsistent throughout the majority of regular and postseason, McKinnie’s shot has gradually become more reliable, scoring 12 points in Game 4 versus Portland — the most he’s racked since nearly October.</p>\n<p>The star of the Warriors second unit so far however has been center Kevon Looney.</p>\n<p>Looney has been a stabilizing force on both sides of the ball, gobbling up rebounds and finishing at the rim like an elite big man. His matchup with Marc Gasol will be pivotal, and if he continues to play with the intensity he had last year the Warriors will be in good position to win.</p>\n<p>It may be, though, that ultimately the Raptors have the edge when it comes to their bench. Equipped with three key players who have demonstrated their ability to compete and change games at the very least threatens the defending champs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.

After leading her Russian team Dynamo Kursk to the title game, Stewart rolled up on fellow WNBA star Britney Griner, rupturing her Achilles in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just months prior, Stewart had experienced one of the highs of her young career, lifting the WNBA championship trophy for the first time as the Seattle Storm swept the Washington Mystics, earning finals MVP in the process. During the regular season, Stewart averaged 21.8 ppg and 8.4 rpg en-route to earn league MVP honors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, because she played in a game that a player of her caliber should not have to play in to make a decent living, Stewart loses a valuable year of her prime, the Seattle Storm lose their superstar for the season and the WNBA loses one of their most marketable players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, all because of a devastating injury that should never have occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is it possible that the MVP of the premier women’s basketball league in the world doesn’t make more than $56,000? It starts with a faulty collective bargaining agreement (CBA) — one that can, should and will likely change in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When WNBA players complain about their salary in comparison to their male counterparts, they don’t expect to get equal pay; obviously, the men’s game makes more money. No, what they want is a similar share of the profits. In the NBA, 50 percent of the total money is allocated to player salaries; in the WNBA, that number hovers around 20 percent. Double Stewart’s salary, and maybe she wouldn’t have to play overseas — instead opting to give her body a much deserved rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that doesn’t explain the whole story, including why the WNBA has consistently lost money over the past 10 years. For that, I blame myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always tried to advocate for women’s basketball; as a 12-year-old, I vividly remember writing in my journal, trying to make a successful marketing plan for the WNBA. What I failed to understand as a young, naive kid was the nature of the main force holding the WNBA back: sexism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all heard the common arguments made by men against women’s basketball: it’s boring, the women can’t dunk and,“I’m a waaaay better basketball player than these women.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last point especially pisses me off, because it manifests itself even in pickup basketball. One of my best friends plays pickup with me weekly, and every time she makes a shot, the game always stops for a minute so everybody can clap and congratulate her. In reality, she’s played more minutes of organized basketball than they ever will in their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I had the privilege of beat-writing for the UCSB women’s basketball team, and I saw first-hand the skill, effort and tactics that went into a game. I will guarantee that freshman point guard Danae Miller could cross over anyone I know, regardless of gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the first two arguments, women’s basketball may be played below the rim, but that makes it no less exciting to hoop nerds like myself. Because there is less reliance on raw athleticism, WNBA players are some of the craftiest finishers around the rim. And in stark contrast to the men’s game, the women’s game relies much less on the three-pointer, which is very refreshing to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, back to my opening sentence: I blame myself because I haven’t done nearly enough to combat this sexism. Yes, I tell my friends they’re dead wrong when they say they can beat women in one-on-ones, but that shouldn’t be seen as an accomplishment. In my six years of being a part of the press, this is my first-ever WNBA article. That needs to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I challenge any basketball fan who is reading this article to watch a WNBA game with an open mind and see what you think. Rather than deriding the players for their inability to dunk, praise them for their backdoor passes, their ridiculous finishes near the rim and their ability to knock down big three’s with the clock winding down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breanna Stewart tore her Achilles because men refuse to give women’s basketball a chance, and because men who do support women’s basketball haven’t done an effective job in advocating for the sport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That changes now.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

legendary careers. Both players are revered and respected by owners, general managers, coaches, players and fans alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they played for different teams, their careers were intertwined and it was almost destined for them to retire in the same year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirk Nowitzki was drafted from Germany in 1998 and would spend all 21 years of his NBA career playing for the Dallas Mavericks. His first year was a rough transition and many doubted he’d bloom into the player he was initially expected to become. Nevertheless, Dirk would continually improve and lead the Mavs to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2006.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposing team would be led by Dwyane Wade who was drafted in 2003 — considered to be one of the most star-studded drafts in NBA history. Wade’s impact was immediate and in just his third year as a professional, he would lead the Miami Heat to their first finals appearance against Dirk’s Mavericks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mavs were the favorites and won the first two games convincingly to take a 2-0 series lead. However, Wade would rise to the occasion and lead the Heat to the promised land. Miami would win the next four games and were crowned champions, and Wade was awarded the finals MVP award for his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both players proved that they earned their stardom by reaching the finals but would struggle to recreate their success for the next five years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be that as it may, Wade had written himself into NBA history, while Nowitzki’s career was plagued by “what-ifs” and almosts. Many — including myself — thought it was likely that he’d ended his career without ever winning a championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, however, Dirk proved naysayers wrong by completing what is undoubtedly one of the most legendary championship runs in NBA history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the finals, Dirk’s Mavs and Wade’s Heat — revamped by adding superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh during the offseason — would meet again, and this time the Heat were the clear favorites. Yet Dirk would cement his name in history by playing like a man possessed, defeating the juggernauts in six games and rightfully earning his finals MVP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both players are considered to be some of the best to ever play the game of basketball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wade is considered to be one of the top four shooting guards of all time. He’s personally my favorite player, and I’ve been watching him play since the day he entered the league. His 16 years have brought me great joy, and his actions on and off the court not only inspired me and many others, but also made me proud to call him a role model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Dirk has been a player I’ve loved and hated. His dominance in the Western conference brought me pain as I watched him defeat and deny the playoff chances of my hometown team, the Warriors, repeatedly. Yet I always respected his attitude and his loyalty. His move, the one-legged fadeaway, is iconic, feared and loved by many. The way he played the game was graceful, and he paved the way for many Europeans to enter the NBA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m thankful to have grown up watching and admiring both not only as athletes, but also as people. They left positive impacts in each of their communities and proved that they’re bigger than the sport. As a fan, I’m proud to have had them as role models and am joyous that they’re leaving the sport greater than they found it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you Dirk Nowtizki and thank you Dwyane Wade.</span><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"253769032\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87614\"><img data-attachment-id=\"87615\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/legends-never-die-a-reflection-on-the-retirement-of-dwayne-wade-and-dirk-nowitzki/dwade/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?fit=183%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"183,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dwade\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?fit=183%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87615\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?resize=183%2C275\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?w=183&amp;ssl=1 183w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwade.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.

and to forget quickly, as there are bigger fish to fry with the Big West Volleyball Championship up next.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the action started last Friday night when UCSB visited UCI for the first of two encounters. The first set of the night started off fairly close, and it seemed momentum kept jumping back and forth between possessions. A quarter of the way through, a kill by UCI’s Aaron Koubi brought his side the first significant lead of the match, with a 9-5 score favoring the Anteaters. Following this point, the Gauchos seemed to flip the script and fought back. Eventually, off a kill by Gaucho outside hitter Ryan Wilcox, UCSB tied the point tally at 15-apiece. For the remainder of the set, it was truly neck and neck, with no side gaining a lead greater than three points. Although it seemed likely that the Gauchos would take this set late, the hosts prevailed by a final score of 29-27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropping that last set must have been quite demoralizing for the Gauchos, because the following set proved to be the team’s worst of the whole series versus Irvine. With the Gauchos not being able to find their defensive bearings in this one, the set would favor the home side once more, resulting in a 25-12 final score. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third and final set of the night saw a bit more energy from the Gauchos, as the good guys kept it close and competitive once more. However, the Anteaters were stingy with their lead in this one and managed a hard-fought 25-22 victory, and the first night went to UCI with a final set score of 3-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday night, it was UCI’s turn to travel, as UCSB hosted its last regular season match. The Gauchos were likely seeking redemption but couldn’t find it in the first set. Although closely matched in the beginning, it was around when the point tally reached 13-8, off a kill by UCI’s Karl Apfelbach, that the visitors began to run away with this one. Although a service ace from Gaucho outside hitter Corey Chavers brought the tally back within five at 21-16, the Anteaters went on to secure the first set of night two with a final score of 25-17 [[ok]].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major bright spot of the series for the Gauchos came in this second set as UCSB fought hard to earn and maintain its lead. The Anteaters didn’t make this an easy task; however, UCSB’s fight paid off as the home side was victorious by a 25-22 tally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third set, it appeared the Gauchos were in a good position to snag back-to-back sets. Still, the hosts were in catch-up mode for the majority of it. A service error on UCI’s behalf did, however, bring it back within one at 19-18. Nevertheless, the Gauchos couldn’t muster up a comeback in time and dropped the third set by a 25-21 result.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and final set arguably wrapped the series up on a high note, as a total of 66 points were tallied by its end. It was truly the epitome of back and forth, neck and neck, in this one, with the lead never surpassing more than two points. Ultimately, the Anteaters took this one, too, by a final score of 34-32 — meaning the final set score also went to the visitors, at 3-1.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This regular season finale was also the senior night for Corey Chavers, Connor Drake and Hayden Boehle, who were all recognized in their last home game at Robertson Gymnasium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next for the Gauchos is the Big West Volleyball Championship. Although these past two defeats dropped UCSB down a spot in the seeding, the Gauchos will be facing a CSUN side whom they’ve bested twice by set scores of 3-0 and 3-2, back in late March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will face CSUN in Hawai’i this Thursday, April 18, at 7:30 p.m.    </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Ironically, when he hit that shot over two years prior, Devearl Ramsey had been playing with Nevada as a freshman and played in that game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho lead reached a pinnacle after Heidegger drilled a fall-away jumper from the inside left-hash to give the ‘Chos a 45-35 advantage, but Fullerton began to make its comeback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowly but surely, the Titans continued to clip at the lead, but UCSB held its own until there were six and a half minutes separating the Gauchos and the Big West Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If only it were that simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s 54-47 lead was snipped down in the final six minutes as the Gauchos went absolutely ice cold from the field and couldn’t hold off the Titan comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton rode a 14-4 run to close out the contest and ultimately took the lead with 1:12 left in the game after a Khalil Ahmad layup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB shot an abysmal 0-10 on its final 10 field goal attempts, but without Devearl Ramsey on the floor, who could blame them?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos ached without their quarterback running the offense and although they made do for a little, there was no production at the end of the semifinal matchup. UCSB was unable to convert on a field goal over the last 7:07 of game-time and Fullerton caught fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In two seasons as the Gauchos’ head coach, Joe Pasternack has taken this team from what was the worst season in program history in 2016-17 to the best two-season stretch, an overall 45-19 record, that UCSB has ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a great culture,” added Pasternack. “As good of a culture as I’ve ever been around, especially the guys that didn’t play. That’s really hard to find. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, freshman Amadou Sow became the program’s all-time freshman leader in points scored with 391 and field goals made with 150. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow was named to the All-Big West Second Team, and Ar’mond Davis notched an honorable mention from the Big West for his 13.1 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarriesse Blackmon was awarded Big West Conference Hustle Player of the year in his senior season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will say goodbye to Davis, Blackmon, Ami Lakoju and Maxwell Kupchak from their current roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question looms: Would UCSB have made the finals if Ramsey doesn’t get injured in the first half?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing is for sure. Pasternack, Ramsey and the Gauchos will bounce back with a vengeance after this semifinal heartbreak.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

men’s basketball team, as late drama favored UCSB during yesterday’s conference quarterfinal against CSUN. As it stands, the Gauchos will be taking on Cal State Fullerton in the next round of the Big West Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News from around the league includes first-seed UC Irvine’s dominant performance in its 63-44 win over UC Riverside. In addition, a lower seed upset also occurred as No. 5 Long Beach State just edged out No. 4 Hawaii after a close 68-66 win; per the Big West Tournament bracket layout, UC Irvine will be facing Long Beach State in the other semifinal match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s overall record on the season now improves to 22-9, only a win away from tying the team record for most wins in a single season. This same record was achieved by the men’s basketball team just last season, as well as during the 2007-08 season’s campaign.   </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a big postseason win, the Gauchos are in inspired form that will hopefully carry them through the remainder of the Big West Tournament. As it was during their last encounter, UCSB versus CSUN once again went down to the wire. This time, however, the Gauchos managed to erase a 12-point deficit, late in the second half, as the team mounted a comeback win of 71-69.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton, meanwhile, will be eyeing postseason glory as well as a .500 win percentage in this upcoming match versus UCSB. The Titans’ overall record on the season now improves to 15-16, while their 10-6 conference record, the same as the Gauchos’, seeds them as the No. 3 team in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton’s quarterfinal matchup against UC Davis proved to be an overtime affair as the Titans earned their hard-fought win by a score of 75-71. This is the Titans’ first win in the month of March, and they will be looking for a second if they hope to keep their season alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos split their two confrontations versus the Titans during the regular season, with a loss on the road before winning at the Thunderdome in late February. In terms of the history between these two sides, UCSB has the slight advantage in leading the all-time series by a record of 48-40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In UCSB’s corner, sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and graduate guard Ar’mond Davis will be the ones to watch for this upcoming postseason matchup. Gaucho Head Coach Joe Pasternack started off proceedings a bit differently in the quarterfinals by employing a starting five made up of four guards, instead of the normal three or two, and this paid off immensely. In their last game against CSUN, McLaughlin and Davis combined for 31 points, along with five rebounds apiece. Both players have played a significant role for the Gauchos all season long, and their presence in the postseason is a testament to the depth of UCSB’s star-studded roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Titan end, the usual catalysts of senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. were once again responsible for their team’s success. Both the top two scorers for their team in terms of total points, Ahmad and Allman Jr. were the only Cal State Fullerton players to finish with double digits in scoring for the quarterfinal bout against UC Davis. It would be in UCSB’s best interests to find a way to halt this dynamic duo’s offensive production.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This installment of the Big West Tournament semifinals is shaping up to be an exciting one,  the second-seed Gauchos take on the third-seed Titans at the Honda Center this Friday, March 15, at 9 p.m. </span></p><div

Pasternack explained postgame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the post, Amadou Sow posted 16 points and 11 rebounds for his fourth double-double of the season. Sow produced from the line for the majority of his points with a 7-8 clip on free throws.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With four field goals in the Thursday afternoon contest, Sow added onto his already record-breaking freshman point total and also became the leader in single-season field goals by a Gaucho freshman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN has relied on concentrated scoring all year, but the ‘Dors moved the ball around well with three players in double figures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big West Conference Player of the Year Lamine Diane scored 22 points but was held to just 36 percent on field goals in his first career playoff game.

The freshman often tallies double digits in the blink of an eye, so keeping him honest through one was huge for UCSB’s confidence heading into the second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought our guys really positioned themselves well so wherever [Diane] went, he had a guy on each side of him,” Coach Pasternack said. “We’ve been dialed in for the past three days on clogging the gaps and I thought we gave him a hard time tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane woke up in the second for his monster night on the glass. Believe it or not, the 6-foot-7 forward’s 17 rebounds was just his fourth-best rebounding performance in his freshman campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bull riders took a 58-55 lead with 7:13 left in the second when Rodney Henderson Jr. delivered a double-take dagger from beyond the arc which seemingly shifted momentum once it sunk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We divide the game into 10 four-minute segments,” Pasternack added. “It’s not about the scoreboard, it’s about winning that war, and that’s what we were focused on doing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Northridge held the advantage until Ar’mond Davis roared back with a five-point tear of his own to tie it up at 65 a piece with just over three minutes left. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, it was a battle of the free throws as UCSB’s final six came from the stripe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos survive another day and will face Cal State Fullerton at 9 p.m. in the Honda Center on Friday, March 15 in the second round in a meeting between the Big West’s two and three seeds.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Defensively, UCSB could do little to slow down Irvine’s offense in the quarter. With leading scorer and First Team All-Big West forward Jordan Sanders back from a concussion, Irvine was able to space the floor better than it had recently. Senior guard Andee Ritter led the team with six points in the quarter — all from behind the arc — and junior guard Lauren Saiki pitched in four points and three assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that quarter, Santa Barbara’s defense improved significantly, with UCSB holding Irvine to 15 points below its conference average on the season. Unfortunately, its offense remained as stagnant as it has been all season. For the game, Santa Barbara shot a measly 15-59 from the floor, including 3-25 from behind the arc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that for next year we have work to do offensively,” Henrickson said. “When we only shoot 25 percent, we know we have to knock down shots.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the rough shooting night for the team, junior center Natalia Bruening played one of her best individual games of the season. With nothing working on the perimeter, the ‘Chos looked to feed the big inside, and Bruening responded with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Just as importantly, Bruening stayed out of foul trouble on Tuesday, allowing her to play 34 minutes in the crucial game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By running its offense through Bruening, UCSB was able to go on a late run, cutting the lead down to only five points with 1:16 left in the game. Still, it was not to be for the eighth-seed Gauchos on Tuesday, with guards Coco Miller and Kiana Vierra both missing open threes that could have brought the deficit all the way down to two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While her shooting was spotty throughout the night, Sanders’ return proved to be the difference for Irvine, with the star forward making both her free throws and grabbing five rebounds in the fourth quarter to secure the victory for the Anteaters. UCI will look to keep its season going on Wednesday when it takes on defending tournament champions CSUN at 8:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Gauchos, Tuesday’s loss marks the end of a volatile season filled with struggles, especially on the offensive end. Still, at the postgame presser on Tuesday, Henrickson hailed the spirit of her young team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We could’ve given up on the season after starting conference play 1-7, but these kids never gave up,” Henrickson said. “They were coachable the whole season.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coco Miller also praised the effort of her team on the season, citing their continued belief and battling as progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the season, we got down as a group when the other team went on runs, and we’d get even more down,” she said. “Towards the end of the season, we started going on our own runs, and they got longer and longer as the season went on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With only one graduating senior, Henrickson will bring back almost all of her weapons for next season. After a whole year of experience under their belt, this group will be looking to grow and come back stronger than ever next season.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

in full effect, as UCSB clinches a second seed bracket in this year’s Big West Tournament. The team will travel to the Honda Center in Anaheim, Calif., where they will look to take on the CSUN Matadors, whom they visited only seven days before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be entering the postseason in fine form considering last week’s results away from home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the team’s final two matchups of the regular season, UCSB traveled to Northridge and Cal Poly last week for a pair of away games. In turn, the on-fire Gauchos posted back-to-back road wins, during which a clutch three-pointer bested the Matadors by a score of 76-74 and another triumphant Blue-Green rivalry performance featured the good guys defeating the Mustangs by a 92-82 result.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following these results, and the previous conference home win that occurred in early February, UCSB has successfully done the double over CSUN. Although the Matadors finished as the Big West’s seventh seed, they have managed close affairs each time they’ve shared a court with UCSB. Regardless, the Gauchos will look to carry their current momentum en route to a desired hat trick of victories.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it stands, the Gauchos can conclude that their regular season was, for the most part, a success. UCSB currently boasts an overall record of 21-9, an exact win percentage of .700. In terms of conference play, the Gauchos’ 10-6 record proved challenging yet equally rewarding, as the team managed a favorable second seed finish in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Thursday’s opponent, CSUN can’t boast similarly favorable results, in regard to its regular season campaign. The Matadors finished with an overall record of 13-19, equaling a win percentage of .406, and a conference record of 7-9 that seeds them as seventh in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering this postseason matchup, the Matadors will have to dig deep, especially since they’ll be coming off of last week’s back-to-back losses against UCSB and first-seed UC Irvine. Their recent results, however, reflect their dip in form since February, in which they’ve managed only four wins in their last 10 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, the Gauchos lead the all-time series against the Matadors by a record of 39-19. This will be the 59th time that UCSB has ever played CSUN, and there will be no love lost between the two sides since the Gauchos also managed a clean sweep over the Matadors in last season’s campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to watch, for the Gauchos, include junior guard Max Heidegger and freshman forward Amadou Sow. Heidegger seemingly loves to play in these matchups considering he’s averaged a whopping 24.5 points and six rebounds when playing against CSUN. Meanwhile, Sow will want to capitalize on his spectacular rookie season by continuing to put on a great show through the postseason. Against CSUN, Sow has twice managed double-digit performances, showing his versatility as a player who can both protect the rim and score at will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whenever you lose an all-league first-teamer, it was very difficult to figure out where we were going to score from,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack responded when asked about the impact of Heidegger’s injury-related absence during the earlier parts of the season. “Sow is as consistent of a freshman that I’ve ever coached,” Pasternack added, “[he] honors the process every day.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Matadors’ end, only one player managed better scoring numbers than Heidegger through these two bouts: freshman forward Lamine Diane. Averaging a game-leading 31 points against the Gauchos, Diane also tallied 13 rebounds last time out. CSUN’s sophomore guard Terrell Gomez also appears to be at the helm of Matador production, as Gomez has notched two double-digit performances against UCSB. The Gauchos should now be familiar with this high-octane tandem, and limiting what these two can do with the ball should be a priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“CSUN is the only team with two players on first team all-conference,” Pasternack said before calling Matadors’ Mark Gottfried a “terrific” head coach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tipoff time is set for 12 p.m. this Thursday, March 14, as UCSB is set to face off against CSUN in the Big West Tournament Quarterfinals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span></p><div

will head to the Honda Center to take on UC Irvine tomorrow in the first round of the Big West Tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the Gauchos (8-21, 5-11), just making it to the tournament feels like a victory in and of itself. Despite starting conference play with a 1-7 record, Santa Barbara never quit on the season, winning four of their last eight conference games to secure the eighth and final seed in the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our team kept coming every day with a great attitude and effort,” Henrickson said. “I’m proud of the group for our resolve and resilience.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos are to keep their season alive, they will have to win four consecutive games in five days, starting with tomorrow’s matchup with the fifth-seeded Anteaters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Santa Barbara, UC Irvine (18-10, 8-8) has limped into postseason play after losing five of their last seven games </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the first of those losses a 71-52 blowout defeat at the hands of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the biggest factor in Tuesday’s matchup will be the health of Irvine’s star forward, Jordan Sanders. Averaging more than 20 points per game on the season, the First Team All-Big West sophomore has missed the team’s last three games with an ankle sprain. In those games, Irvine’s offense has been completely out of sorts, with the team only scoring 56 points per game. On Monday, Irvine’s Head Coach Tamara Inoue acknowledged that Sanders’ status is still uncertain heading into Tuesday’s matchup with SB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Sanders doesn’t play, the Anteaters scoring load will fall to the backcourt duo of Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter. While Saiki has been inconsistent at times this year, her 12.1 points per game rank second on the team, while she leads the squad with 127 assists on the season. Defensively, Saiki is the engine behind Irvine’s vaunted full-court press </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a press that has generated almost 21 turnovers per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More of an off-ball guard, Ritter’s shooting makes her a constant threat on the offensive end. Even amidst a recent cold stretch from deep, Ritter leads the team with 52 made three’s on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Gauchos, Henrickson will look to lean on the backcourt duo of Second Team All-Big West guard Coco Miller and All-Big West Honorable Mention Danae Miller for the team’s offensive production. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Gauchos’ drubbing of Irvine in February, those two combined for 41 points, 9 assists and,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perhaps most impressively, only four turnovers despite a constant full-court press from Irvine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve asked [Coco and Danae] to do a lot for us this year,” Henrickson said. “Danae has stepped into a scoring role, and Coco’s leadership and consistency has led us all year. Both of them have an incredibly high basketball IQ.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of the backcourt, Santa Barbara also looks to feed the ball inside to junior center Natalia Bruening. While only playing 24 minutes per game, Bruening has chipped in almost 10 points and six rebounds per game. If Sanders can’t play, Bruening should have even more space to operate in the post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the odds may be against Santa Barbara to make an almost improbable run in the tournament, they can be inspired by the success of Cal State Northridge last season. Despite being the fifth seed and having to play on Tuesday, Northridge won four games in five days to secure the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Big West tournament conference call on Monday, Henrickson discussed the rich history of the Gauchos’ program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a program that has won this very tournament 14 times in the past. While Santa Barbara may be the lowest-seeded team in the field, they have proven over and over again this season that they will not go down without a fight. If the cards fall the right way, don’t put it past UCSB to make a deep run in the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will kick-off their postseason play against Irvine on Tuesday at the Honda center, with tip-off slated for 6 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
