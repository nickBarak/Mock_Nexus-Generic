Last year, UCSB was 2-7 before reeling off an incredible 17-7 run to finish its season at 19-14 with an 11-5 Big West record. USC improves upon its perfect record and is now 6-0 to begin the season, its best start since the 2000-01 campaign where it started 8-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into the match, the Trojans were 4-0 at home through five games, averaging almost 81 points per game. That didn’t change against the Gauchos as the home team was able to score a season-high 96 points in its rout.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_74470\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74470\" data-attachment-id=\"74470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-28/gauchos-struggles-continue-fall-to-0-5-after-96-72-loss-at-usc/gabe-vincent-drives-to-the-hoop-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent drives to the hoop.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite managing to hang around for most of the game with a solid 45 percent shooting from the field and having four players in double figures, UCSB had no chance of stopping a red-hot USC team who shot 54 percent from the field and was deadly from three knocking down 14 long balls, a season high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the Trojans were excellent with the three ball from the very beginning knocking down four of their first six attempts — two from junior standout guard Elijah Stewart — within the game’s first four minutes to take a commanding 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara answered throughout the majority of the match thanks to strong play from senior guard Eric Childress and junior guard Gabe Vincent. After a Vincent three, Childress matched him with one of his own to bring the score to 16-12 with 14:11 left in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next eight minutes consisted of back-and-forth baskets by both teams with USC’s lead never growing larger eight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After a layup by junior forward Alex Hart, the Gauchos found themselves only down by two at 25-23 with 6:36 left in the first half. Hart finished with a season-high 14 points after shooting 7-14 from the field in, another season high, 26 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB cut the lead to two, USC went on a 16-8 run to take a 10-point lead with just over a minute left to play in the first half. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright scored 10 of those points during the run and finished with a game-high 21. Santa Barbara managed to make it close before the half only going down 43-38.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB kept shooting well throughout the half, which led to them constantly cutting the lead, USC’s three-point range was so deadly that Santa Barbara could never tie the game let alone take the lead. In the first 20 minutes, the Trojans were 8-19 from three while the Gauchos were only 3-11.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the beginning of the second half came the resurgence of redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju. The Harlem, N.Y. native only scored a total of nine points in his last three games, but scored six of his teams first 10 to spring the Gauchos early in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would cut the lead to four with a big tip-in at the 14:23 mark, making the score 51-47. Lakoju would finish with 12 points in the contest. After back-to-back Trojan three’s, Childress responded with his second of the match to keep the score within single digits. The senior finished the contest with six points and a season-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as the second half continued, the same thing that doomed the Gauchos in three of their first four losses came to fruition yet again at the Galen Center. After a UCSB lay-up making the score 66-59, the Trojans finished the game on a 30-13 scoring run making the final score a 96-72 rout. Stewart had eight of those final 30 points and finished the night scoring 18.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet again, the second half woes seem to continue hurting Santa Barbara, who, at times, just cannot seem to get out of its own way. Despite the loss, there were many positives such as a season-low nine turnovers, the resurgence of Hart and Lakoju and scoring 44 points in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Jalen Canty also finished with a monster game posting the second double-double of his career with a career-high 16 point and 10 rebound performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a 0-5 start is not ideal by any means, the Gauchos have the pieces in place to turn this season around as it is still very early, and with more and more contributions starting to come from younger players fitting into their roles, this could happen sooner rather than later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB resumes play against Sonoma St. at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 1 at the Thunderdome.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UCSB’s 0-3 record to begin the year is its worst start since the 2000-01 campaign when they started 0-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs host the Gauchos boasting a 3-1 record including a 2-0 start at home with impressive wins over Gardner-Webb and Eastern Michigan.

SMU’s win was the most recent as it beat UCSB 80-73 in an overtime match on Dec. 8, 2014. With only 10 seconds left in that game, guard Gabe Vincent nailed a game-tying three to send the game into an extra period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent has played a big role in the Gauchos offense since his arrival in 2014. The former Big West Freshman of the Year has averaged a team-high of 16 points per game to start the season including a 23-point effort in a loss to USF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the junior guard has hit his fair share of struggles this year only shooting 30 percent from the field and 24 percent from three-point range. Last year, Vincent had the same woes through his first three starts, shooting only 24 percent from the field before ultimately getting on track and shooting 40 percent by the end of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eric Childress will also need to be a key factor if the Gauchos hope to notch the first win of the season against a very tough opponent. Childress is coming off a career-high 14-point outing against CSU Bakersfield and leads the team in assists with four per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the biggest key for Santa Barbara will be taking care of the ball. Against the Roadrunners, the Gauchos turned the ball over a season-high 21 times, negating the fact that they outshot their opponents and outrebounded them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key will be to keep the energy high through both halves of the match. This year, Santa Barbara has been outscored 102-100 in the first half but 124-93 in the final half of games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing this, SMU will surely try to take advantage with their high-octane offense. In the second half of games this season, Southern Methodist has outscored its opponents 164-114, meaning the Gauchos will definitely need to be on high alert or the game could turn into a blowout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Mustangs average 73.2 points per game and are shooting an impressive 45 percent from the field and 36 percent from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Guard Shake Milton has played a big role in the SMU offense averaging 12 points per game and shooting a solid 43 percent from the field. The Oklahoma native was one of 20 candidates named to the 2017 Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award watch list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Semi Ojeleye will also be another player the Gauchos must be weary of. The forward was named American Athletic Conference Player of the Week for Nov. 14 after averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds in both games that week. Ojeleye leads the team in points per game with 20.3 and shoots a team-high 48 percent from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defeating SMU will not be an easy task but a necessary one if Santa Barbara wants to get its season on track. A big road victory would be something that could definitely boost the confidence of all the Gauchos, especially the young ones who are dealing with this type of adversity for the first times in their careers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on SMU at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 22 at the Moody Coliseum.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UCSB outscored NAU 32-16 in points in the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Well my teammates are great about throwing me the ball,” Edelman said. “I can just get the deep seal and they pass it to me and it’s a wide open layup; I don’t even have to make a move or anything. They [NAU] weren’t double teaming me, [so] it was pretty easy to catch it down low, turn and score. Having the size advantage [helped too]. It’s different when it’s 6’4” against 6’4,” but when I’m playing against somebody who is four or five inches shorter than me, I for sure have a size advantage on them.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara improved to 2-2 on the season in its return home. NAU, currently on a two-game losing streak, is now 2-2 as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB made a season-high 12-of-14 free-throw attempts in the game. Its 85.7 free-throw percentage was more efficient than any of its free-throw performances from last season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most notably, the Gauchos held the Lumberjacks to their lowest point total through four games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hard fought battle between the two programs ensued as both shot 35 percent from the field in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to get Edelman the ball was evident from the game’s first quarter as she established her dominance in the paint, scoring six points on 3-5 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After taking an 11-7 lead at the 6:15 mark of the game, UCSB was held scoreless until a made layup by junior forward Taylor Farris with 18 seconds remaining in the period. Farris gave the Gauchos stability during their lethargic start, concluding Sunday with eight points on a 4-6 shooting night and six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just feel like I’m doing whatever the coach asks. If you want to play, you have to come out hard,” Farris said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the score, NAU managed to overcome its four-point deficit with an 11-0 scoring run in the closing minutes of the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving life to NAU’s offense was senior guard Brittani Lusain. The senior guard led Northern Arizona in scoring, rebounds and assists with 17 points, nine rebounds and three dimes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU earned its largest lead of five points, up 16-11 as a result of a three-point make by redshirt junior forward Kenna McDavis. The Boise State transfer was responsible for two of the Lumberjacks’ total of four three-point makes, sinking 2-3 from deep to end the first half with 10 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to UCSB, Northern Arizona experienced stagnancy on offense as McDavis’ basket would be NAU’s last field goal of the first quarter and the drought continued into the second. NAU went scoreless from the 2:04 mark in the first until McDavis scored its first points at the free-throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams continued to trade baskets, leading to a 25-25 tie at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU’s last lead of the game, 33-31, was formed by senior guard Rene Coggins taking a wide open right lane to score the go-ahead layup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite going 1-11 from behind the three-point line, coming out of an NAU timeout, the Gauchos gained a spark in the closing minutes of the third quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s penetration of the paint helped provide spacing on the perimeter as an assist from inside by Edelman to Porter for the three-pointer was made. NAU would go on to knot the score at 36-36 in responding with a long distance make by senior guard Taylor Leyva, who has six points and three rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing UCSB with a comfortable lead was a quick 7-1 run to close out the third. The Gauchos gained a 43-37 lead after sophomore guard Coco Miller’s only three-point make of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the fourth quarter, NAU pulled within a one-point deficit a total of four times, but was unable to regain the lead over UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping fend off the Lumberjacks, who trailed 47-46, was senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in recording her first field goal of the game with 4:42 remaining in the game. She achieved a career-high in free-throw makes and attempts, missing just one as she went 9-10 at the line to register 11 points. Jemerigbe and Miller tied for the game-high in assists with five. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite five fouls limiting her to just 25 minutes, the redshirt sophomore made her first start of the season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring each of her field goals from beyond the arc, going 3-5, Porter knocked down a clutch three-pointer to push the Gauchos’ lead to 56-50.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter’s three-pointer was UCSB’s last field goal of the game as the Gauchos secured their victory at the free-throw line. Adding further security to the win was a steal by Miller on an inbound attempt by NAU, leading to Jemerigbe being fouled and ending the game with free-throws. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back on the road on Friday, Nov. 25 at the University of San Diego. It will face the Toreros at 5 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74380\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/edelmans-career-high-20-points-leads-ucsb-to-home-victory-over-nau/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74380\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/edelmans-career-high-20-points-leads-ucsb-to-home-victory-over-nau/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/edelmans-career-high-20-points-leads-ucsb-to-home-victory-over-nau/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/edelmans-career-high-20-points-leads-ucsb-to-home-victory-over-nau/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/edelmans-career-high-20-points-leads-ucsb-to-home-victory-over-nau/","id":314,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[313,312,311],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel To Seattle in Search of a Second Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"If the early offensive pattern for both Seattle University and UCSB holds true, spectators can expect to see a lot of three-pointers when the two teams meet in Seattle on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to truly determine a trend from only a couple games.

They have one girl who’s taken 19 threes in two games and they’ve taken only eight free throws, which is really indicative of a lot of catch-and-shoot from three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of Seattle’s offensive production, including its production from three-point land, comes from just two players: senior wing Kaylee Best and senior wing Alexis Montgomery. Best, a 5’8” senior wing, is shooting over 47 percent from long range and is averaging a Western Athletic Conference-high 21.5 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just need to limit (Best’s) touches,” Hendrickson said. “We need to execute ball-side deny, we need to know their personnel and where she is on the floor, and we need to keep our hands up on defense. The main thing is just going to be keeping the ball out of her hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow Montgomery has started off on fire, shooting 50 percent from three and scoring 14.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopping Best and Montgomery, or at least keeping them relatively quiet, is UCSB’s best chance at forcing the Redhawk offense to a halt. Only one other Seattle player — senior guard Claire Metoyer — is averaging over five points per game. If the Gauchos can get the ball out of Best or Montgomery’s hands, they’ll have succeeded in getting the Redhawks out of their offensive comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their two regular-season games, plus their exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, the Gauchos have shown a definite affinity for the three, but Hendrickson isn’t planning on making that a focus on Friday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our advantage is inside, so we’ll focus on getting high percentage touches there,” Hendrickson said. “If we can do that consistently, the defense will collapse and we can kick it outside. If we can score a number of different ways it really puts pressure on the defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Redshirt junior Drew Edelman will be the key to success of Hendrickson’s game plan. The 6’4” center put up 16 points, all in the second half, to push the Gauchos past Pepperdine on Tuesday and will be the player point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and junior Drea Toler will look to funnel the ball down low to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Hendrickson’s vision come true, and the Gauchos succeed in forcing the Redhawk defense to collapse, there will be several beneficiaries among the UCSB offense. Sophomore wing Coco Miller went off for 24 points, including five threes, against Pepperdine, and, along with guards junior Makala Roper and sophomore Sarah Porter, will be eager for kick-outs from Edelman and the other Gaucho bigs.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Seattle University at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 18 at KeyArena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74355\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74355\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/","id":309,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[308,307,306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns First Victory in Home Opener Behind Miller’s 24 Points","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite having a lower field goal percentage than its opponent in Pepperdine, the UCSB women's basketball team managed to earn its first win of the season with its three-point shooting and attack in t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a rewarding ending at the Thunderdome for the UCSB women’s basketball team Tuesday night as it defeated Pepperdine 66-57 in its home opener.

Hitting her first three-pointer of the game during the run, Bordonaro scored five points to contribute to her team-high total of 15 points on 6-12 overall and 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green scored the other four during the scoring stretch, ending the game with 12 points on 4-11 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gained its first double-figure lead of 21-11 during its 10-0 run that carried over from the end of the first to the second period. It earned its largest lead of 14 points at 27-13 as a result of a made layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB pressured the Waves’ offense into turning the ball over a total of 22 times, but was inefficient in capitalizing on its opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite shooting 6-16  from three-point range in the first two quarters, the Gauchos struggled inside the three-point line and had issues converting on their forced turnovers, going 3-18 on layups in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you miss a wide open layup, you’re focused on the wrong thing,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “You’re wide open, you’ve got to finish. We missed nine [wide open layups]. We just absolutely didn’t reward our defense for opportunities in transition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inconsistencies in transition ultimately led to Santa Barbara’s being held scoreless in the remaining 5:47 of the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pepperdine embarked on a 9-0 run to end the first half, trimming the Gauchos’ lead to 27-22 at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tie of the game occurred at the 7:42 mark of the third quarter as Pepperdine’s Green had an open left lane to the basket, knotting the game at 29-29. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping improve the Gauchos’ 24.3 field goal percentage was their improvements in shot selection in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a balance to UCSB’s three-point attack was its emphasis on getting the ball to the paint in the second half. It attempted just eight three-point attempts, finishing the game 8-24 from downtown, and displayed its commitment to Edelman early. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to feed Edelman in the paint was beneficial as she ended the third quarter with 10 points on 4-7 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three-pointer by Porter just 30 seconds into the fourth quarter regained a double-figure lead for UCSB, building its lead to 45-34.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring eight of her 12 total points in the fourth quarter of the game was Pepperdine’s sophomore forward Yasmine Robinson-Bacote. Able to convert on an and-1 opportunity Robinson-Bacote after a successful drive to the hoop, bringing the Waves’ deficit to 51-44.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steal followed by a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Paige Fecske allowed the Waves to stay in contention, trailing 58-51, as they called a timeout after the field goal with 51 seconds remaining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of Pepperdine closing in on their lead, the Gauchos managed to secure their first victory at the free throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB kept its poise at the line, making 13-21 free throws in the fourth quarter alone as it ended 16-25. Miller and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe led UCSB in its foul shooting, making a combined 13-18 from the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An arid pass out of bounds by Bordonaro followed by a turnover in Pepperdine’s final two possessions of the game allowed UCSB to milk the clock in the game’s remaining 12 seconds, finalizing UCSB’s 66-57 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to maintain their momentum on the road at Seattle University tonight at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

These two guards make plays and take shots, pushing along the speed of play.</p>\n<p>Childress played hard all 34 minutes that he was on the court, coming away with four defensive rebounds as well as four assists. Despite Santa Barbara accounting for 18 total turnovers in their opener, Childress was a bright spot only turning the ball over twice.</p>\n<p>An up-and-coming power player for the Gauchos is redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju.

In their exhibiton, Canty went off for 17 points, a performance the Gauchos hope they can get in this match-up.</p>\n<p>Canty, a distinguished player from the City College of San Francisco, has maintained his position as a starter and managed to rebound four balls, block two and grab five points in his 22 minutes against the Mavs. His size and energy on the court have already made a difference for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite losing key players Devin Watson and Tim Derksen — two Dons that played really well against UCSB — USF is coming in hot after having closely won their first game against Illinois-Chicago 82-80.</p>\n<p>One returning player, sophomore guard Mladen Djordjevic, scored eight against the Gauchos last year. Having worked his way to a starting position this season, the former Serbian U-20 Men’s National Team player scored nine against the Flames along with four assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Two returning starters, forwards Nate Renfro and Chase Foster, stand to step up into bigger leadership roles this year. Last season they only scored a combined three points against the Gauchos. Now that their top dogs are gone, it is their chance to show the team just what kind of players they are.</p>\n<p>As a freshman last year, Renfro shot 51.2 percent and had 19 blocks on the year, proving his capability as a starter. Against Illinois-Chicago, he scored 12 points over 27 minutes along with three assists.</p>\n<p>Foster came away with eight points, shooting 4-9 against the Flames. During the 2015-16 season, the Colorado native made 27 three-pointers and played in all 30 games.</p>\n<p>Senior Ronnie Boyce shone brightly as a leader against the Illinois-Chicago, scoring 28 points in 26 minutes of playing time, 13 points more than any other player on the court. Boyce, a guard originally from Oklahoma, will definitely be a player to watch.</p>\n<p>Transferring to USF as a junior in 2015, he earned his position as third-leading scorer on the team, including a career-high 25 point performance away with a career high of 25 points, a personal record he has already beat in just the first game of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>In last year’s UCSB-USF game, Boyce played only two minutes.

They drive it, they can create shots for themselves and screen well. Coming off our last game, we have to be able to defend 1-on-1 [[one-on-one]] better, work on keeping someone in front of us.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are looking to get on a winning track after season-opening losses, leaving them 0-1 entering Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s meeting against the Waves resulting in a close loss, the meeting marked the breakout of junior guard Makala Roper after a career-high 27 points in the loss. The performance led to Roper being moved from the bench to the starting lineup for the remainder of the 2015-16 season after having just six her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Finishing with 25 starts, Roper capitalized in her starting role. She led the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 points per game and ended with a team-high six 20-plus point performances, four of which occurred after her career game against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Roper will hope to have more of an impact on Tuesday after just eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field and a 2-4 showing from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Preventing Roper from getting into a shooting rhythm were her issues handling the ball as she finished the game with a game-high five turnovers. The Gauchos’ sharpshooter will look to overcome her miscues early in the season after ranking second in the Big West with an average of 4.0 turnovers per game the previous year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what ‘Rope’ does is a byproduct of the efforts of Onome and other players to drive and kick to her,” said Henrickson. “She does a good job of using screens and setting her feet. There are times when we want her to put the ball on the floor and drive it, [which is] an opportunity to manufacture some offense at the free-throw line. [Tuesday] will be a great opportunity for her to get back on track and be the player we all think she can be.”</p>\n<p>The issue with turnovers has plagued UCSB’s entire unit as its lax ball control resulted in it turning the ball over 24 times on Friday. The Gauchos were outscored 26-17 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was really just poor decisions. We tried to make plays that weren’t there,” said Henrickson. “We didn’t take what the defense gives us as opposed to [issues with] weak side help or we don’t seal inside. It’s never a one-player mistake. The guards have to do a better job; the bigs have to do a better job.”</p>\n<p>The inefficiencies when possessing the ball are reminiscent of last season’s start in which Santa Barbara ended leading the Big West with 18.5 turnovers per game. In 2015-16, it amassed 20-plus turnovers in 14 games, going 4-10.</p>\n<p>In addition to turnovers, the season opener highlighted how vulnerable the Gauchos are in the paint. They were at a disadvantage against the Cyclones, being outscored 46-20.</p>\n<p>“We did a poor job of recognizing weak side defense and at times we didn’t give the effort you need to be able to get a touch one-on-one inside,” Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>Although a concern, the team is still conforming to the depth added to its frontcourt this offseason as it has made redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman the starter in her first year with the program. In 25 minutes of play, Edelman tallied six points on 3-6 shooting, a tied team-high six rebounds, and one block.</p>\n<p>There will be little room for error Tuesday night against Pepperdine, as even in their season opening loss against Long Beach State they held the 49ers to 44 points.</p>\n<p>Despite the defeat, the Waves managed to contain the 49ers to dismal shooting percentages of 20.9 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine boasts a young roster that possesses just one senior within its total of six players returning from last year. It lost its best player, guard Erica Ogwumike, this offseason as the team’s leading scorer transferred to Rice University after averaging the fifth most points by a freshman in the nation with 18.4 PPG.</p>\n<p>An all-around talent, Ogwumike led the Waves in rebounds and steals per game at 7.5 and 1.9 per contest, respectively. She scored 22 points in the Waves’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>However, the loss has opened opportunities for other players that could potentially fill the Waves’ void.</p>\n<p>Returning from an injury last season and leading Pepperdine in scoring in its season opener was redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro. She finished with a game-high 12 points, going 4-10 from the field. Bordonaro’s 3-5 finish from behind the three-point line carried the Waves’ 40 percent shooting from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As the lone senior on the team, guard Allie Green topped Ogwumike’s points in the first meeting. She went off for team-high 24 points on 9-15 shooting and was 1-1 from behind the three-pointer. She will look to clean up her shooting after a 4-16 outing from the field and 11 points in the team’s opener.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Pepperdine will tip-off at 7 p.m. this Tuesday, Nov. 15 in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74179\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74179\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/","id":311,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[310,309,308],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall Short to Cyclones’ Wraith in Season Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team was unable to control the combined forces of Iowa's State's home court advantage and dominance in the paint, leading to the Gauchos' 77-60 loss in their road season op...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering Friday’s game against Iowa State, the ultimate defensive focus for the UCSB women’s basketball team was shutting down the Cyclones’ three-point game.

The Cyclones put up 46 points in the paint to the Gauchos’ 20 and notched an advantage in second chance baskets over UCSB 17-2.</p>\n<p>A cold shooting night from all over the floor didn’t do the Gauchos any favors in playing from behind. UCSB finished 18-47 from the field for a shooting percentage of just 38.3 percent and shot 73.9 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe was UCSB’s leading offensive force for the night, scoring 16 points in 23 minutes. Jemerigbe was also the team’s leading outside threat, knocking down three three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter was the only other Gaucho to finish in double figures, putting up 10 points on 3-7 shooting. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler played well off the bench, dishing out six assists and coming up with four steals, the most on the team by a significant margin.</p>\n<p>It seems counter-intuitive based on the Cyclones’ strong play in the paint, but the Gauchos did put up a strong rebounding performance on both ends of the court. UCSB pulled down 28 rebounds, nine of which came on offense, compared to Iowa State’s 36 boards.</p>\n<p>Iowa State jumped out to an early lead and just never looked back, propelled by a combination of jump shots and layups from players like senior guard Seanna Johnson, redshirt junior Jadda Buckley and sophomore forward Meredith Burkhall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos never once held a lead during Friday’s game, and Iowa State at one point managed to stretch the lead all the way to 29 midway through the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Johnson led all Cyclone scorers with 16 points and added seven rebounds for good measure. Four other Iowa State players finished with double-digit points, including redshirt senior forward Heather Bowe, who also had seven steals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to move on in search of their first win of the season on Tuesday, Nov. 15 at home against Pepperdine at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-13/gauchos-fall-short-to-cyclones-wraith-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-13/gauchos-fall-short-to-cyclones-wraith-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-13/gauchos-fall-short-to-cyclones-wraith-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-13/gauchos-fall-short-to-cyclones-wraith-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-13/gauchos-fall-short-to-cyclones-wraith-in-season-opener/","id":306,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[305,304,303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Open Season on the Road, Face Iowa St. Cyclones","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Bonnie Henrickson era is ready to begin its second season as UCSB faces Iowa St. on the road for its season opener.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>College basketball will officially make its return this week as men’s and women’s programs across the nation begin their seasons.</p>\n<p>As for the UCSB women’s basketball team, it will play its season opener on the road at Iowa State this Friday.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In 2015-16, Iowa St. ranked second in the Big 12 in total three-point field goals made, knocking down 208 to go along with its average of 6.93 three-point makes per game. Nothing restricted the program’s willingness to shoot the deep ball throughout the season as they ended with a total of 678 three-pointers attempted.</p>\n<p>Despite making 208 shots from beyond the arc, the Cyclones three-point percentage remained low at 30.7 percent, ranking ninth in their conference.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key to defeating Iowa State is to disrupt the Cyclones from beyond the arc. Inevitably, that is the goal for the Gauchos, who allowed an opponent three-point percentage of 30.9 last season.</p>\n<p>“Iowa State is a program, historically, that shoots a lot of threes,” UCSB Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “The thing is, we’ve got to limit the number of threes they get. We’re not trying to get in a ‘who can make more threes contest,’ because that’s not going to be in our advantage.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos don’t stand much of a chance if they try to outgun the Cyclones, but it’s a very different story if they manage to force Iowa State inside.</p>\n<p>Doing so not only evens the playing field between the two sides, but it would also go a long way toward keeping what’s sure to be a massive crowd quiet.</p>\n<p>“The best way to keep [the crowd] quiet is to not let [Iowa State] hit a bunch of threes,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s many perimeter players will be instrumental in carrying out Henrickson’s defensive strategy. In practice, Henrickson placed a heavy emphasis on perimeter rotations, shifting from one player to another in an attempt to deny the Cyclones any open threes.</p>\n<p>For what it’s worth, the Gauchos were very successful at keeping Cal State L.A. quiet from three-point range in their exhibition game on Sunday, holding the Golden Eagles to 25 percent from long range on 5-20 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>However, doing the same against a program like Iowa State — projected to finish fourth in the Big 12 — will be a much more challenging task.</p>\n<p>While the Cyclones’ first look on offense is to the outside, the Gauchos plan to look inside when they have the ball. The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, playing her first year for the Gauchos after transferring from USC, has given UCSB a veritable post presence.</p>\n<p>“We’re always going to go inside,” Henrickson said. “If we’ve got a good post player, we’re always going to go inside.</p>\n<p>You have to, because if you’re not good right there it’s just too easy to guard everything else.”</p>\n<p>Edelman demonstrated the strength of that offensive ideology on Sunday, posting 10 points and 10 rebounds in 20 minutes of play. Standing at 6’4”, the center enjoys her role as the focal point of the offense.</p>\n<p>“It definitely feels good [to be the first look],” Edelman said. “I can help get some easy buckets, especially early in the game because they’ll collapse and at that point I can look out to the three.”</p>\n<p>Standing out at the three-point line will be an array of solid shooters, a new strength for the Gauchos. Junior guard Makala Roper and sophomore guard Coco Miller played that part admirably last year. Roper led the team with 63 made three-pointers and Miller followed with 53. Ole Miss transfer sophomore guard Sarah Porter is another component within the Gauchos’ array of shooters.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s perimeter depth extends to the point guard position as well, where veteran senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe is joined by Drea Toler, a redshirt junior point guard who transferred from the University of Oregon.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, both Jemerigbe and Toler displayed an affinity for the drive-and-kick, finishing with six and seven assists, respectively.</p>\n<p>Roper, Miller and Porter were the overwhelming beneficiaries of those drives, receiving open looks from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>It’s unlikely that Toler and Jemerigbe will be able to have such success against the Cyclones, but the inside-out game could still pay dividends. Combine that strategy with some success in containing the Cyclones from three-point land, and the Gauchos might just have an upset brewing.</p>\n<p>The matchup between UCSB and Iowa St. will tip-off on Friday, Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. PST at Hilton Coliseum.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 and continued on page 7 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-open-season-on-the-road-face-iowa-st-cyclones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-open-season-on-the-road-face-iowa-st-cyclones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-open-season-on-the-road-face-iowa-st-cyclones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-open-season-on-the-road-face-iowa-st-cyclones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-open-season-on-the-road-face-iowa-st-cyclones/","id":308,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[307,306,305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Face Mavericks Season Home Opener on Sat.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBasketball-161106-DustinHarris-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBasketball-161106-DustinHarris-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For the second consecutive season, the UCSB men's basketball team will face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its season opening game.

It finished the season on a nine-game winning streak before ultimately falling to Hawaii in the conference tournament, ending its hopes of making the NCAA tournament and, effectively, ending its season.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks are also coming off a solid season in which they went 18-14 overall and 10-6 in its conference, the Summit League. Like the Gauchos, the Mavericks are projected to finish fourth in their conference.</p>\n<p>When these two teams met one season ago, Santa Barbara spoiled Nebraska-Omaha’s season and home opener, winning the match 60-59; revenge will probably be on the mind of the away team.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gabe Vincent played a huge role in that one-point victory, scoring 16 points in 27 minutes. Despite the team-high five turnovers, Vincent was efficient with 5-16 shooting, three rebounds, two assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>In the exhibition match against the Sunbirds, the California native looked poised for another great season, scoring 11 points and knocking down three shots from three-point range. Vincent is coming off 80 three-pointers made a season ago, the second most in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB has much more to look forward to besides Vincent, however, with players like junior transfer Jalen Canty and senior point guard Eric Childress.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Childress looked great, scoring 10 points, grabbing six boards and dishing out seven assists. More importantly, he had no turnovers during his 27 minutes played.</p>\n<p>Childress was actually the reason for the Gauchos’ win over the Mavericks last season, as with three seconds left he got an offensive rebound and tipped in the game-winning basket.</p>\n<p>Despite the excellent performance of the two guards, it was the big forward who made the most noise against Fresno Pacific. Canty was sensational, scoring game-high 17 points in just 18 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The California native was running up and down the floor pulling down seven rebounds and registering two blocks. The big man was also efficient as he scored 17 on 8-10 shooting from the field. He did struggle from the line, only mustering one make in five attempts, but that can be fixed as the season goes on.</p>\n<p>“I loved it [his energy], especially in the second half,” Williams said. “He was aggressive trying to score and he rebounded well in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Christian Terrell was also phenomenal in his first game as a Gaucho. The Sacramento native only scored six points, but dished out seven assists and was an efficient 2-4 from the three-point line. He also pulled down five rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly looked like the more dominant team against Fresno Pacific, and it was good to see everyone get a chance to play, but chances are things won’t be so easy against Nebraska-Omaha.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks return two key starters from their lineups last year in senior guard Tra-Deon Hollins and junior forward Tre’Shawn Thurman. Both were named to Summit League Preseason All-League Teams, with the senior earning a first-team nomination and the junior notching a second-team nod.</p>\n<p>Hollins, like Canty, is actually a transfer from community college. In his first season as an NCAA player, the Omaha, Nebraska native shone, averaging 12.5 points and 6.1 assists per game, and led the nation with 3.97 steals per game. The senior garnered a total of 127 steals, the most of any player in the NCAA since 2001 and the fourth most since 1985, the first time the steal was recognized as a statistic.</p>\n<p>Due to his excellent play, Hollins was recognized as Summit League Defensive Player of the Year and Transfer of the Year while also earning a Summit League All-Newcomer selection.</p>\n<p>Like his senior counterpart, Thurman also had a successful 2015-2016 campaign averaging 13.9 points, 6.7 boards and 1.3 assists per game.</p>\n<p>He finished the season with five double-double performances and scored a career-high 30 points against UMKC in a 95-89 overtime victory. Against the Gauchos last season, Thurman scored 10 points, but eight of those came in the second half.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s season opener should prove to be a fun one for both teams and even the fans involved. These are two teams that played a close match just a season ago, with the outcome determined by a game-winning basket with just seconds left.</p>\n<p>Both teams are also returning key starters, which makes the game that much more exciting as we see the battles of the two athletes happen again. With that being said, there is no doubt Santa Barbara will want a win to start the new year.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Nebraska-Omaha are set to tip off at the Thunderdome on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 2 p.m. Our twitter, @thenexus_sports, will be live tweeting the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

You know who is on the court with you and how to get them the ball.”</p>\n<p>With a focus this offseason to improve the team’s pace of play, the Gauchos’ work was evident as they played to an up-tempo beat.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara capitalized on defense, stifling the Golden Eagles’ offense in points off turnovers 23-3. CSULA shot 32.8 percent on a 19-58 shooting effort and 25 percent from behind the three, going 5-20 from deep.</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to establish its quicker play on the offensive end, embarking on a 7-0 run in the game’s opening minutes. Making her presence felt and appearing in her first game as a Gaucho after transferring from USC was redshirt junior Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>Listed as a forward on the team’s roster, Edelman started at the center position instead and had success in the paint. She scored six of the Gauchos’ first nine points en route to ending the game with a double-double of 10 points and a tied game-high total of 10 rebounds in 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ scoring stretch in the game’s early minutes led to a Golden Eagles timeout. CSULA benefited from the quick break, going on a 7-2 run of its own to trim UCSB’s lead to 9-7.</p>\n<p>Igniting the Golden Eagles’ scoring charge was a three-point make by sophomore guard Christine Delapina. Bringing the team within two points was a layup by freshman guard Da’Jah Jackson, who led CSULA in scoring, rebounding and steals with 12 points, five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>Despite coming near, the Golden Eagles were unable to ever tie or take the lead as UCSB registered its best shooting quarter of the night in the first. It shot 11-16 from the field for a 68.8 percentage and 3-6 from long distance.</p>\n<p>The efficient shooting occurred during the Gauchos’ 20-4 run to close out the first period. Setting the stage for UCSB’s scoring outburst was sophomore guard Coco Miller. Able to halt CSULA’s surge with a three-pointer to give UCSB a 12-7 lead, Miller’s make from deep was the start to the Gauchos’ rout.</p>\n<p>Miller concluded the night 5-10, 3-8 from deep for 14 points alongside five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>With 10 players getting at least five minutes of play in Sunday night’s game, the Gauchos’ depth was on full display. Although its shooting stroke seemed nearly flawless, UCSB’s high-scoring performance resulted from its initial plan to attack the paint.</p>\n<p>“We started the game by throwing it to Drew,” said Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “You have to be good around the rim because then it forces ‘are you gonna guard the rim or are you gonna give us threes?’ That stretches the defense, but if you can’t be good around the rim, you’ll stretch it then can’t do anything. [For] every really good team, if you’re good right there you have a chance, especially if you put three-point shooters around the outside.”</p>\n<p>Achieving the drive and kick game plan was no issue for UCSB as it consistently penetrated the paint, sucking in the Golden Eagles’ defense, then converted with three-point makes.</p>\n<p>Unafraid to shoot the ball when given the chance was the team’s leading scorer Porter. She went 5-11 from behind the three-point line; just two of her total seven field goals were inside the line to cap off a near double-double with eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Either driving to the paint for layups or to dish the ball to the perimeter were Toler and senior guard Onome Jemerigbe. Along with Toler’s assists, Jemerigbe chipped in six dimes of her own to go with just one turnover. UCSB doubled the Golden Eagles’ amount of assists 20-9.</p>\n<p>Also helping the Gauchos spread the floor and get the ball to their shooters was their advantage in rebounds. They outrebounded CSULA 54-33. Tying with Edelman for the lead in rebounds was junior small forward Taylor Farris with 10.</p>\n<p>Although Sunday’s game was only an exhibition, it was an encouraging performance for UCSB heading into its season opener this Friday. It reached the 90-point mark just once last season in a 93-78 win over Morehead State and was one point shy against La Verne.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its 2016-17 campaign on the road at Iowa State this Friday, Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. PST at the Hilton Coliseum.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

I thought he was good, especially second half, very aggressive, trying to score, he rebounded well both halves,” Head Coach Bob Williams said.</p>\n<p>The California native led all scorers with 17 points and ran all over the court grabbing seven boards and registering two blocks.</p>\n<p>The home team started a bit slow but managed to take an 8-5 lead into the first official timeout. After a made three-pointer by FPU’s junior point guard Jordan Belasco that tied the game, the Gauchos scored seven unanswered and saw most of its starting five head to the bench.</p>\n<p>After two made baskets by the Sunbirds, sophomore forward Ami Lakoju scored six points in a row over the course of 52 seconds to extend the UCSB lead to nine at 21-12.</p>\n<p>Last year, Lakoju scored a career-high four points at Cal, a statistic he crushed today scoring six baskets for a total of 12 points while snagging four boards.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first half, the Gauchos took an impressive 36-22 lead. Three of Santa Barbara’s newest additions, Canty, and freshman guards Christian Terrell and Clifton Powell Jr. combined for 11 points.</p>\n<p>Without any single player emerging as a beast for Fresno Pacific in the first half, the Sunbirds worked together to earn their 22 points with three-pointers scored by senior point guard T.J. Viney, Belasco and junior guard Sam Holmes.</p>\n<p>As the second half began, it was clear that the home team was starting to pull away. The Gauchos started the second half strong with back-to-back layups from Canty.</p>\n<p>Later in the final frame, UCSB successfully made three long balls in a row, one from junior guard Gabe Vincent and two from senior point guard Eric Childress, to take a 51-29 lead.</p>\n<p>After that, at the 8:29 mark, freshman guard Terrell made a fantastic steal, quickly passing down the court to a wide-open Childress.</p>\n<p>The senior caught the pass mid-stride, scoring effortlessly, raising Gaucho supporters to their feet as the home team took a game high 26-point lead at 69-43.</p>\n<p>Having only scored over 80 points on five occasions last season, the Gauchos finished the game with a whopping 82 while holding their opponents to 62. Fifty of those points were earned by four players — Canty, Childress, Vincent, and Lakoju — with each scoring in the double-digits.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall loss, Kavika Jimenez led FPU with 13 points, six rebounds, and three assists.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara saw many good things from its young team, but primarily from the big three that will be leading the team this year: Childress, Vincent, and Canty.</p>\n<p>Childress played great finishing with 10 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Vincent, on the other hand, was only 3-10 from the field but all three shots made were from long distance, plus two free throws from the line saw him scoring 11 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“I was pleased with the leadership from Eric [Childress] and Gabe [Vincent],” Williams said. “They played well but more importantly were so poised and had good leadership with the young kids as they got rattled.”</p>\n<p>There are a number of seasoned players on this team, but the Gauchos gained new talent this year and though they appeared to be comfortable and fluid on the court, there is room for improvement as the season progresses.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball season will officially start with a non-conference game against Nebraska-Omaha on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 2:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73940\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73940\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/","id":307,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[306,305,304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Perspective: Women’s Basketball Focused for Sunday Exhibition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"  Basketball will officially make its return this Sunday when the UCSB women’s basketball team tips off its exhibition matchup versus Cal State Los Angeles in the Thunderdome.

This could be due to the fact that the Gauchos are replacing five seniors including star guard Michael Bryson, who was a two-time All Big West First Team selection during his collegiate career.</p>\n<p>Bryson led the team in points per game with 20.1, and fellow seniors forward John Green and center Sam Beeler were third and fourth on the team with 10.8 and 6.7 P.P.G., respectively. Bryson also led the team in rebounds with 6.4 per game.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Santa Barbara has retained two key pieces who will look to be huge factors for the team this season in point guard Eric Childress and shooting guard Gabe Vincent.<br>\nChildress is the only senior on the team this season and has hopes of ending his career well.</p>\n<p>“Nothing much changes for me,” said Childress. “I just want to be a leader for these young guys and help keep them composed during the game. These guys are going to look at me to show them the right way to go.”</p>\n<p>Last year, the 6’0” guard was named a Big West honorable mention after averaging a team-high 4.3 assists per game and leading the team in three-point percent at 45.1 after knocking down a career-high 32 long balls. He was also tied for the first in steals with Vincent at 1.2 per game.</p>\n<p>With that being said, Childress knows he still needs to sharpen his game in some levels in order to be the most effective floor general out there, both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“You always want to cut down turnovers as a point guard and I definitely want to find some more scoring opportunities,” said Childress. “I want to play the best I can but I don’t want to ruin this team’s chemistry. I just want to fill my role and be a leader.”</p>\n<p>Like his senior teammate, Vincent was also a Big West Honorable Mention after hitting 80 three-pointers last season, second most in school history, and averaging 14.1 points per game, second best on the team.</p>\n<p>“I had a pretty good offseason, worked on my game,” said Vincent. “Every year people expect more and I expect a lot from myself as well. I’m excited to show what I’ve been working on and see how far we can take this team. The goal is to get that ring and go play in the big tournament.”</p>\n<p>The former Big West Freshman of the Year has some big hype surrounding him due to his great shooting ability. Last year he knocked down over 40 percent of his shots, higher than 38 percent from long range, and shot a career high from the line with 80.8. With constant improvement, the Gauchos will expect nothing less this year.</p>\n<p>“Gabe is a great player offensively and can play both ends of the floor,” Williams said. “I expect big things from him; I think he will have a big year.”</p>\n<p>While returning players are always welcomed, ultimately what will carry this Santa Barbara team is the new additions, and none come with more expectations than City College of San Francisco transfer junior Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>During his 2015-2016 campaign at CCSF, the 6’8” forward was named 2016 California State Player of the Year after leading his team to a 32-1 record and a California Community College title while averaging 13.3 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.4 blocked shots per game.</p>\n<p>“I want to bring rebounding and defending to my team,” Canty said. “For this team to be successful, I’ll be willing to do anything.”</p>\n<p>Returning to the helm for his 19th season, Coach Williams will look to continue to add to the solid legacy he has built at UCSB so far. He is only one of three coaches in Big West history to earn over 300 wins.</p>\n<p>“Love dealing with kids and young men who want to be good and want to get better,” Williams said. “They rejuvenate you. Every year the chance to deal with new fresh kids, and watching their growth.”</p>\n<p>Excited to open the 2016 campaign, the Gauchos will face off against Fresno Pacific in an exhibition match this coming Sunday. Last season, the Sunbirds went 14-13 en route to a disappointing finish in which they were eliminated from postseason contention after losing their senior day matchup.</p>\n<p>Under the helm of a new coach in first-time Head Coach C.J. Haydock, however, Fresno Pacific will look to bounce back and make a statement that this upcoming season will be a better one.</p>\n<p>The Sunbirds are projected to finish 11th in their conference, but they do return two starters from last year’s team, including the team’s second-leading scorer redshirt senior guard Spencer Krannitz, who averaged 14.9 PPG and shot 50.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Although picked to finish fourth in the Big West for the second consecutive season, the Gauchos have the pieces to make a much better run. Besides the two returning guards and Canty, the Gauchos are looking forward to contributions from many other players on the young roster.</p>\n<p>Hopefully Sunday’s exhibition match will be a coming out party for the Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s exhibition vs. Fresno Pacific tips off at the Thunderdome on Sunday, Nov. 6 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The team concluded the 2015-16 season 12-20 overall and 8-8 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Much buzz surrounds Cal State L.A. heading into the 2016-17 season as it will be led by the tutelage of basketball Hall of Fame legend Cheryl Miller. The Golden Eagles finished 6-3 in their last nine games of the season and were able to lock up the No. 8 seed in the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship Tournament before being eliminated by No. 1 seed Cal State Dominguez Hills. CSULA finished 10-17 overall and 8-12 in CCAA play.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB’s improvement of eight wins last season ranked 13th in the nation after having just two wins the previous year.</p>\n<p>The team’s growth shall continue as it returned all five of its starters and introduced new talent to its squad with five newcomers.</p>\n<p>At the core of the Gauchos’ growth was their defense. UCSB finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 62.8 average. It continued its stout defensive efforts during its conference schedule as well, improving to second in allowing just 61.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a team with more depth in both the back and front courts, Sunday’s game should be another step toward the Gauchos trying to finalize their starting lineup and bench rotations.</p>\n<p>Improving UCSB’s backcourt is the addition of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Forced to sit out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, the former Oregon Duck has displayed her ability to consistently play at a high level on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>During her time at Oregon, it was not until the latter half of her second season that she saw more playing time, playing in 29 games and starting in 12 of the team’s last 13 contests. She averaged career totals of 3.9 points and 2.35 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Although the backcourt duo of Toler and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe is no guarantee — possibly making the Gauchos too small in size — the pairing of the two could possibly result in the fastest, most agile backcourt in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As either another option in UCSB’s backcourt or as a stretch guard or small forward, redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter is another Gaucho that was stashed away due to NCAA transfer rules.</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB after a season of very limited minutes at Ole Miss, Porter seems to have a natural knack for scoring based on her time at Horizon Christian Academy.<br>\nShe set a single-game school record for most three-pointers made with eight and concluded her high school career with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>Upgrading the depth of the Gauchos’ frontcourt were the 2016 recruiting additions of centers redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and freshman center Natalia Bruening; their class also included freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>The pair of 6’4” post players provides UCSB with the opportunity to improve on the boards and lessens its reliance on a “small-ball” lineup.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ranked seventh in the Big West in defensive rebounds per game with an average of 35.3. Their inconsistencies when collecting boards while defending led to their issues in allowing second chance points. Including conference play, UCSB was outscored 479-339 in second-chance points.</p>\n<p>Edelman, who will be eligible to play this season, played in a total of 36 games while with the Trojans. She did not have much of a role, averaging just 1.2 and 1.35 rebounds per game in two seasons at USC, but can be of help to the Gauchos who were short on length in their interior. She grabbed a career-high seven rebounds during her sophomore year.</p>\n<p>Coming out of Corona del Mar High School, Bruening enters UCSB after setting school records for career rebounds and blocks during her time with the Sea Kings. Nimble around the rim, Bruening brings vertical ability to UCSB’s paint presence with her volleyball background as well.</p>\n<p>Despite all five of its starters returning, UCSB’s latest additions provide the team with an array of possible changes to come which could lead to a tweak in the starting five or a deeper dependence on the depth within its bench.</p>\n<p>Similar to the circumstances UCSB faced last season in introducing Henrickson to the program, Cal State L.A. finds itself in the same position as Sunday will be a glimpse into the Golden Eagles under the helm of first-year Head Coach Cheryl Miller.</p>\n<p>Enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Miller is a legend in the game of basketball both as a player and coach. She helped bring two consecutive national championships to USC in 1983 and 1984, earning NCAA Tournament MVP honors twice in her collegiate career.</p>\n<p>Cal State L.A. had a total of four different players average double figures in scoring last season. However, just one of these top-scorers, junior center Rikke Fabricius, is returning after being third on in scoring and rebounding with 11.6 and 4.4 rebounds per game. She tallied double digits in points in 19 games.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s exhibition game will begin at 5 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/","id":337,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[336,335,334],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":19,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
