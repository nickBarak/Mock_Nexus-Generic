Hawaii sits in fourth place but only one game behind the Gauchos with a 15-6 overall record and 4-3 mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely not easy [to travel]. It helps to get here a little early to adapt to the time change and get the jet lag out of our system,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “But when it comes to game time we’re going to be ready to play and give 40 minutes of fight. We’ve done it before, so it’s not too big of a disadvantage to come out here.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos enter the game with momentum on their side, winning two home contests last week against UC Irvine and UC Davis in impressive and dominating fashion. The victories propelled UCSB back into first place after a weekend, which saw them fall to Cal State Fullerton and narrowly escape UC Riverside in overtime.</p>\n<p>“After the loss to Fullerton it was kind of another wake up for us to realize that if we don’t come ready to play each night, teams that may not have the best record can easily come out here and beat us,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos with a pair of monster performances last weekend was junior center Alan Williams. The big man garnered his fourth Big West Player of the Week Award this season after he averaged 26.5 points, 15 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two victories.</p>\n<p>Also of importance was the emotional return of sophomore guard John Green on Saturday against Davis. Green played in his first regular season game as a Gaucho after injuries derailed his collegiate career over the past three years. It will certainly be of interest to see how Green progresses and emerges into Santa Barbara’s rotation of wing players including Boswell, sophomore guard Michael Bryson and sophomore forward Taran Brown.</p>\n<p>With a return to health for the majority of its lineup and riding two important conference victories, the Gauchos are certainly poised to continue their run as a contender in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to come out last week and get two solid wins,” Boswell said. “It definitely gives us momentum, and we feel like we can compete with any team in the conference and that we’re the best team in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s matchup will certainly challenge the Gauchos, however, as the Rainbow Warriors are victorious in four of their past five games. Hawaii boasts an impressive 11-3 home record and leads the conference in scoring with over 82 points per game, over eight points better than the second ranked team.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be a tough game. They got some solid wins in the preseason and they have a lot of talent on their team,” Boswell said. “They’ve got some guards that are really quick and can push the tempo and they’ve also got some big guys that are a force to be reckoned with down low. We’ve just got to come out with a lot of energy like we have the last few games and play hard and let the game come to us.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Christian Standhardinger leads Hawaii in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.6) per game, ranking third and fifth in the conference, respectively. The Rainbow Warriors also tout sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year. Fotu ranks in the top 10 of the conference in both points and rebounds. Junior guard Garrett Nevels also places in the top 10 in Big West scoring, giving the Rainbow Warriors three top scorers.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be really difficult; Standhardinger is an awesome player. He gets to the foul line and is one of the best in our league,” Boswell said. “He’s a force in terms of driving to the basket and creating contact. You can’t completely eliminate a factor like him but if we can keep him contained, and make him work for his points and don’t give him second chance opportunities … I think we’ll have a pretty good shot at taking down the Warriors.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s tough when you’re in the game for 40 minutes and play so hard and compete and leave it all on the court and the scoreboard doesn’t indicate the game we played,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But, my head’s still up; these players are going to keep their heads up because we played a really good team and we had every opportunity to win.”</p>\n<p>Halfway through Big West play, the Gauchos now stand at 6-15 overall and 1-7 in conference, losers of eight of their last nine. Hawaii improves to 11-9 overall and 5-3 in league.</p>\n<p>“It’s my responsibility to make sure we focus on what we need to do and continue to stay positive and stay together,” Mitchell said. “We’re now at the halfway mark of Big West play and I will not give up. There will be no fat lady singing until hopefully we’re cutting down nets at the Honda Center.”</p>\n<p>Down three just minutes into the second half, senior guard Destini Mason picked up her fourth foul. Mitchell decided to leave her senior in the game. The decision paid off as Mason scored UCSB’s next five points, sparking a 9-2 run to take a 42-36 advantage.</p>\n<p>“That’s always a tough decision from a coach’s standpoint (to leave her in with her fourth or take her out),” Mitchell said. “You’re looking at [Mi’Chael Wright and Melissa Maragnes] as freshmen and Clair only being here a couple weeks, so I had to go with a senior and trust she’d make the right decisions and not foul out. We needed her on the court.”</p>\n<p>However, Hawaii would not go away. The Rainbow Wahine kept the score close by getting to the free throw line, shooting 22-24 from the charity stipe, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to just 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Up three with three minutes remaining, Hawaii went to its star in senior forward Kamilah Jackson. Despite a quiet night due to foul trouble early, she stepped up in critical moments, scoring six straight points for the Rainbow Wahine to give her team a three point lead with under a minute to go. Jackson finished with 14 points in 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>“We were playing a three-two trap and we kept opening up the inside,” Mitchell said. “We had to cut to that low block because that’s where she wants to work, so I’ll have to look at and see if it was our weak side guard not dropping down for a rebound or if it was our back line not full fronting her.”</p>\n<p>Twice in the final minute, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe drove into the lane and converted a lay-up to bring her team within one.</p>\n<p>However, at 61-60 with 18 seconds left on the clock, UCSB tried for the steal rather than fouling right away. Hawaii ran the clock down to just seven seconds, which gave the Gauchos little time to get down the court to get a decent three point look after the Rainbow Wahine sunk both free throws.</p>\n<p>“We knew going into the game they weren’t really playing with a true point guard, so we were trying to get them off-balance (by trapping), trying to get them to force turnovers and speed them up a bit,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t get a three point shot off as Hawaii took the foul to ensure Santa Barbara would have no opportunity to tie the game and the Gauchos lost their fourth consecutive game.</p>\n<p>While Hawaii’s big lineup proved a tough match-up for UCSB, one matchup that worked well for the Gauchos was senior guard Melissa Zornig, who was guarded by senior guard Sydney Haydel. Santa Barbara went through and to Zornig all night and she finished with a team-high 16 points.</p>\n<p>“They were all power forwards, so they had the mismatch on us, but Coach Mitch told us before the game that that means [we have] mismatches too,” Zornig said. “I’ve just been trying to focus on staying relaxed and not focusing on my shot.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit also added 13 points and four assists while Jemerigbe tallied 10 points. While not in double-figures Mason was critical, scoring nine points and grabbing a career-high four steals.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a bye Saturday and then will return to action next Thursday when it hosts Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I made it!’ Right there, I was like ‘I want to do this.’”</p>\n<p>Just like that, Mason was enthralled with the game of basketball.</p>\n<p>“I was outside all the time … all the time,” Mason said. “Every chance I could get, I was playing with guys and playing with people older than me.”</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to college, where Mason is playing for the UCSB women’s basketball team. The passionate little kid who grew up wanting to play professionally is still inside her and evident to all around her.</p>\n<p>“She’s the first one in the gym most of the time and the last one out of here, always grabbing the freshmen to spend extra time with them on their skills,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She’s just a basketball junkie. That’s the fun part of it — she eats, breathes, lives and is passionate about the game.”</p>\n<p>Now in her senior year, Mason is experiencing a breakout season. While not known for her offense in previous years, Mason is one of the three seniors anchoring the Gaucho attack this year, which has seen tremendous improvement from previous seasons. The senior guard ranks third on the team in scoring at 12.8 points per game, shooting an impressive 42.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Destini on the court is not too different than Destini off the court — just very, very high energy,” teammate Nicole Nesbit said. “She’s a very passionate player. She’s very into the game. You can see it all over her face when she plays.”</p>\n<p>Entering this season, Mason’s career-high was 13 points. That total has been shattered on four separate occasions, the most recent coming during UCSB’s first Big West game of the year at rival Cal Poly where Mason totaled 24 points. She also broke her career-high in field goals made as she went 10-17 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly game foreshadowed good things to come during conference play for Mason. Despite the team’s struggle, Mason has continued to improve during Big West play.</p>\n<p>Mason increased her field goal percentage to 46.9 percent and has elevated her game from long range, knocking down six three-pointers, which is just one shy of her total from nonconference play. She’s also upped her percentage from behind the arc from 31.8 percent to 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“Destini is a very talented player and I think she’s definitely starting to come into her own and feel confident, especially on the offensive end,” Nesbit said. “She is very good in transition; she’s a good attacker. She has good size and can usually post up smaller guards. She has a very nice mid-range jumper. She can shoot the three as well, but doesn’t as often. She’s a complete offensive player and I think she’s starting to believe that.”</p>\n<p>However, Mason is much more than a scorer. It may not show up in the box scores, but since her arrival to Santa Barbara, Mason has served as the defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think I just have a niche for defense,” Mason said. “Defense is just really about heart, which I have, and not wanting to get scored on, which I have, and (then some) positioning, technique and strength.”</p>\n<p>Yet, possibly the biggest asset Mason has given to the Gauchos this season is her versatility. With an undersized roster, Mitchell has often moved the 5’8’’ Mason to the power forward position, although Mason has been known to play positions one through four all season long.</p>\n<p>“I like watching the game and I think that’s why, being a four player this year, it came kind of easy because I watch it so much,” Mason said. “It just came natural because I knew their positioning and what they were looking for.”</p>\n<p>The transition has actually aided Mason who, as a guard, leads the team in rebounding with 6.0 boards per game. She also averages 0.9 steals and 0.5 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“Just having so many players (from Rutgers) that are in the [WNBA], I tell her that she has to be great at everything,” Mitchell said. “You can’t just do one thing well to be a WNBA player, so I just challenge her every day to be a complete player and not just one-dimensional and I think her versatility will give her a look.”</p>\n<p>Altogether, Mason seems to be making the strongest case she can to the WNBA. Add all of Mason’s accomplishments together along with the fact that she serves as the team’s vocal leader this season and Mason easily makes a case for the most improved player under Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of those that it’s the reason you coach, and you smile because I can remember walking into this gym for my first skill workouts and I saw her sitting in the corner, but at that point she had asked for her release and was transferring from UCSB,” Mitchell said. “That’s what you want from young women is for them to mature and grow and be independent and confident in who they are as an individual and as a basketball player. So, you have to smile for her now being out there confident, the jokester and the ultimate leader.”</p>\n<p>If looking closely, Mason’s game actually resembles one of the great players to play in the WNBA and one of her role models: Deanna Nolan, the three-time WNBA champion and 2006 Finals MVP. Both are long guards that have incredible athleticism and while not the flashiest players, make a substantial mark on every game.</p>\n<p>“[Nolan] would jump out of the gym. The elevation on her jumper was ungodly,” Mitchell said. “She also played with that little cocky edge, which I’m okay with, and I think all the great players have somewhat. Some people could misread it, but to me it shows she’s passionate; she plays with a level of excitement that you don’t take that away from players.”</p>\n<p>But as a student of the game, Nolan isn’t the only player that can be seen in Mason’s game. When looking closely, you might see pieces of a pair of L.A. Laker guards.</p>\n<p>“I copied a lot of people, but that’s okay because that’s how you get better,” Mason said. “I take bits and pieces of a lot of different players, so [Nolan] definitely with the way she flows with the offense with the ball.

Williams was a big reason Santa Barbara moved into first place with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 mark in the Big West. Davis now stands at 7-15 overall and 2-5 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I love the fact that he got 20 and 20. It says something about a guy if he can go get 20 and 20 in a game,” Coach Williams said. “That doesn’t happen very often. He’s already getting a lot of national attention but you get 20 and 20, that’s a feat.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished the first half with 10 points and 12 rebounds and followed that up with a 17-point, eight rebound performance in the second half. Big Al also finished the game with four assists and two blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“We go to him every game to see who can stop him because I don’t think anyone in division I basketball can stop him,” freshman point guard Eric Childress said.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 15 points on 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc, becoming only the third Gaucho to make 200 career three-pointers in the process.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 11 points for UCSB, while Childress added eight points and three assists. This game was never in question as the Gauchos outrebounded Davis by a margin of 14 and outshot the Aggies in both field goal and three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that we can run this conference and really be the number one team to win that Big West Championship,” Green said. “Once we have the opportunity to meet these two teams that we lost to [we’re confident] that we’re going to handle business.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest against UC Irvine began the weekend on a high note for the Gauchos, as they stomped the Anteaters in an 80-60 victory. Big Al led UCSB with 26 points and 10 rebounds despite having to go against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye who is all of 7’6” and 290 pounds.</p>\n<p>“We really came out very intense, excited to play and we definitely showed some stuff tonight,” Big Al said. “We showed our heart, we showed our aggressiveness and we showed our competitive edge out there. When we have that competitive edge and we play as hard as we did tonight we’re a tough team to beat.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 16 points and shot a perfect 5-5 from the three. Boswell scored 10 points off the bench, sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added eight points and six rebounds and junior point guard Zalmico Harmon contributed seven points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Following a Saturday victory at Cal Poly, Irvine now stands tied with UCSB for first with a 5-2 Big West record (14-9 overall).</p>\n<p>“We have guys that have really accepted their roles on this team and I think that we’re finally starting to see how good we can possibly be,” Big Al said. “Of course we have a lot of work to do, but when we all accept our roles and play our roles we’re a tough team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays Thursday at Hawai’i.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/gauchos-surge-to-first-place-after-pair-of-wins/","id":558,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[557,556,555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Third Straight at Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is struggling as the Gauchos fell to eighth place in the conference standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During Big West play, there has been one dominant storyline for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ downfall is inconsistent play.

The Aggies move into a three-way tie for third place, improving to 9-11 overall and 4-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With a struggling team, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell changed the starting lineup, benching two of her three seniors and instead starting three freshmen, a sophomore and Zornig. The move worked as the Gauchos jumped out to an early 20-9 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just had to mix it up and I was going with effort,” Mitchell said. “It’s obvious what we’ve been doing so far hasn’t worked and we just wanted energy to start the game.”</p>\n<p>However, Davis responded, picking up its defensive intensity by switching into its trapping defense and offensively taking advantage of its size down low. The Aggies stormed back to take a one-point lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second half, Santa Barbara came out flat once again. Three-point shots sparked a 7-0 fun for Davis, giving the Aggies a comfortable lead. In the second half, UCD shot 41.7 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons on their team,” Zornig said. “They have good post players inside and then a lot of them can knock down the three. That’s their game and we knew that.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the second half, UCSB found ways to cut the lead to five or six points several times, but could never come up with the defensive stop needed to get within one possession.</p>\n<p>“At that point, it’s more mental than anything. You can’t trade baskets, especially when you’re down,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “There were a couple times where we would get a stop, we’d go down and score and then miss a box out or something like that. I know we had a couple of key mental mistakes in the second half and things like that cost you games.”</p>\n<p>The biggest discrepancy came at the free throw line. The Aggies, the best free throw shooting team in the Big West, shot 31-36 from the charity stripe while the Gauchos did not stand up to their second place ranking in conference, shooting just 18-29 from the line.</p>\n<p>“I’m not even going to spend the effort talking about their 36 attempts. It was our lack of knocking down the 29 attempts we had,” Mitchell said. “If you’re going to get that many attempts on the road, you have to focus. You win on the road by making layups, not turning the ball over and getting to the free throw line. We got there; we just didn’t knock them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis’ leading scorer, junior forward Sydnee Fipps, scored 21 points for Davis, but it was sophomore forward Alyson Doherty that killed UCSB and exploited its lack of height down low. Although averaging 11.7 points per game, Doherty exploded for a game-high 23 points on 7-11 shooting, including 9-12 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Nesbit led the team with 17 points while Zornig added 14 points and a team-high eight rebounds. In addition, in her first start in conference play, freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright finished the afternoon with nine points and seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Mi’Chael’s that blue-collar kid that is going to go after every rebound and that’s why we recruited her,” Mitchell said. “She stepped up tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next week to take on Hawaii and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53824\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53824\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/","id":557,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[556,555,554],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Backed Into a Corner, Need Big West Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-092.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-092.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels to UC Irvine today","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s been a disappointing year for the UCSB women’s basketball team so far.</p>\n<p>Currently 1-4 in the Big West, Santa Barbara has lost on the road and at home.

You coach to win every game. The players play to win, so other than that it’s short-term memory and you get back to work.”</p>\n<p>Holding seventh place in the Big West, the Gauchos will have the opportunity to shake up the conference standings this weekend as Irvine sits just one place above them. The Anteaters are 9-10 overall and 2-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While most of its games have been played on the road, Irvine owns a perfect home record of 4-0.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem throughout conference play for UCSB has been consistency. In the team’s most recent loss to Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara played a solid first half, taking a 33-23 lead into halftime. However, the Gauchos broke down defensively in the second half, allowing the Titans 44 points.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a broken record, but we have to continue to do what we usually do, especially with defense,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “At this point in the season, everyone needs to know their role. Nothing has changed from the beginning to the season to now. We have to do what we do and do it well.”</p>\n<p>The only point of reliability for UCSB this season has been its offense. The Gauchos rank third in the conference in field goal percentage, shooting 40.6 percent. Their three senior guards in Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason average double-figures on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>Yet this week, the stress in practice is undoubtedly on defense. Not only has the Santa Barbara defense been uncharacteristically inconsistent this season, holding teams to 62.8 points during wins compared to 73.1 points during losses, but Irvine ranks second in the Big West in scoring with 71.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters may not be the tallest team, but they do have a big post presence inside. Irvine will work its offense around senior forward Camille Buckley, who ranks eighth in the conference in scoring with 15.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll mix it up,” Mitchell said. “We’ll have to be extremely disciplined, like we were the first half against Fullerton, and we’ll have to probably run two different people at Buckley at times looking to double team her because she’s that good.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Buckley isn’t the only offensive threat. Irvine surrounds Buckley with shooters, including senior guard Jennifer Tsurumoto, who ranks first on the team and fifth in the league in scoring with 16.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Any given night, they have Camille Buckley who has the chance to play at the next level. She’s a big time athlete, but they also have shooters,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced. Any given night, they can probably beat anyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>After playing defense, it will be critical for the Gauchos that they secure the rebound, not only to keep Irvine from earning second chance opportunities, but to jumpstart the offense before Irvine can set its zone defense.</p>\n<p>Led by Buckley, who averages 9.4 rebounds per game, Irvine ranks second in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 41.8 boards per game. UCSB currently ranks last at 34.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding is huge,” Mason said. “We only got outrebounded by three [against Fullerton], but it’s when we got outrebounded. It was at critical times and they got momentum off of it because they were knocking down threes.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/","id":553,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[552,551,550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Struggles Continue","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos fall to UC Irvine 77-60","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Prior to the UCSB women’s basketball team’s game at UC Irvine, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said her team would double team Camille Buckley on defense, calling her a big-time athlete who will have the opportunity to play at the next level.</p>\n<p>Despite the defensive focus on Buckley, the Gauchos could find no answer for the senior forward.</p>\n<p>Buckley finished the night with a game-high 27 points and 15 rebounds.

Give her credit, she’s a good player, but we allowed her to get things too easy.”</p>\n<p>The loss marks the first loss to Irvine during the Carlene Mitchell rein as Santa Barbara remains winless on the road in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters outrebounded the Gauchos 43-28. They also shot 26-33 from the free throw line compared to 6-10 for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious there wasn’t an attack mentality in just the discrepancy with the free throws,” Mitchell said. “You’re not going to win on the road no matter who you’re playing if that’s the amount of times we’re sending them to the free throw line. And a lot of those free throws stem from the rebounding side of it. So, rebounding and free throws – that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Similar to all season long, Santa Barbara failed to play a consistent game. The first half saw a back and forth game between UCSB and UCI until the Anteaters finished the first half on a 6-0 run to take a 38-30 halftime lead. Buckley contributed four of those six points.</p>\n<p>Then to open the second half, the Gauchos continued to fall apart. UCSB was unable to find the bottom of the net until 15:56 into the second half, allowing a 10-0 run by the Anteaters. The lead would be too large to overcome as UCSB could only play Irvine even the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“They took it right at us and we had a turnover on the offensive end the very first possession that led to a layup on that end. It was just back to back,” Mitchell said. “It’s frustrating and our kids didn’t fight through it. You’d like them to be able to make one mistake and not let it carry over to the opposite end of the floor. It did two or three times.”</p>\n<p>With the victory, Irvine remains a perfect 5-0 at home. They improve to 10-10 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Santa Barbara, on the other hand, drops to 6-13 overall and 1-5 in conference.</p>\n<p>“You have to be positive completely. As a team, we have to stay together and know what our strengths are,” Nesbit said. “We have to treat every game like we’re going in to win every time.

The Gauchos will attempt to rebound from the loss when they return home, where they are 5-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>Irvine, meanwhile, had a six-game winning streak snapped when they fell to Hawaii on Saturday for its first and only conference loss so far this season.</p>\n<p>An interesting matchup to watch in this game will be UCSB junior center Alan Williams against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye. The 6’7” Williams ranks first in the Big West with 22.9 points and 10.6 rebounds, and is second in blocks at 2.4 per game. Ndiaye, however, is an imposing 7’6”, the tallest player in the nation, and leads the conference with 3.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be interesting to see how much of a defensive impact Ndiaye will have on Big Al, the seventh leading scorer in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Al will be fine against him. Al will be able to score. [Ndiaye] really affects the game, he’s huge. We’ve never played against anything like him, nobody has,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At the same time he scores nine points a game. His biggest effect on the game is on the defensive end, he’s tremendously effective down there at taking away the rim. Al might have to hit jumpers but I think Al will find ways to be productive.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Anteaters are dangerous and versatile, ranking second in the conference averaging over 75 points per game. Senior guard Chris McNealy leads Irvine with over 12 points per game, while junior forward Will Davis II and freshman guard Luke Nelson each average just above 11 per game. Ndiaye along with sophomore guard Alex Young score above nine points per game to give the Anteaters a reliable starting five.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounds pulling down nearly 40 boards per game, while placing atop the Big West with a 48.5 field goal percentage. Ndiaye and Davis II each average just above six rebounds per game to lead the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good rebounding team, they have a plus-six average on the year rebounding-wise, which is a big number in college basketball. And that is not just Mamadou,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly will not go down without a fight, especially in front of a home crowd that has come out to support in recent games. In the last two home games, the attendance at the Thunderdome has averaged more than 4,500 fans per game.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can make this place really tough for opponents to come into. That’s our main goal: to get as many students out here as we possibly can,” Big Al said. “Every game is important when you get into conference, especially home games. You’ve got to win as many home games as you possibly can, and this one’s really important, so we’ve got to get it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the key number for the Gauchos seems to be 70. UCSB is 11-0 when they allow 70 points of fewer and 1-6 when allowing 70 or more. In order to defeat first-place Irvine, Santa Barbara will need to keep Irvine’s numerous offensive weapons in check.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will respond to Irvine with a trio of wing players who have supported Big Al from the perimeter. Brown along with sophomore guard Michael Bryson and senior guard Kyle Boswell have been impressive from three-point land this season, with the latter two each ranking in the top six in three-point percentage in the Big West. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has helped facilitate the scoring with a conference best 5.2 assists per game and a 3.6 assist to turnover ratio which ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a good team. But it’s not a better basketball team than Cal, [and] it’s not a better basketball team than us. We’ve got to show up and play,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January  30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/","id":555,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[554,553,552],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Fullerton at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB gave up a lead to Fullerton, falling to the Titans at home for the first time since 1991.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Cal State Fullerton guard Chante Miles wasn’t her team’s leading scorer Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>She even finished the game three points below her season average, but in the critical moments, she showed up in a big way.</p>\n<p>Despite taking a 10-point lead into halftime, the UCSB women’s basketball team found itself up just four with a little under eight minutes to go in the second half.

She’s such a great ball handler. There were a couple times we gambled in the backcourt, and she made us pay by attacking and getting to the rim.”</p>\n<p>After UCSB regained the lead, taking a slight 55-52 advantage, Miles converted a layup in transition and earned the foul, completing the three-point play to tie the game with 3:27 remaining.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Miles drove into the lane and dished the ball to junior forward Kathleen Iwuoha for the layup, giving the Titans a three-point lead.</p>\n<p>Finally, after Santa Barbara missed a jumper to bring the game within one with 24 seconds to go, Miles was fouled and hit the two clutch free throws to ice the game. She finished the afternoon with 11 points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s hard to guard a great player like that one-on-one,” Mitchell said. “That’s not what our defense revolves around, so it was probably the rotation in why she was able to attack and get a couple and-ones.”</p>\n<p>After winning 40 consecutive games against the Titans, UCSB has now dropped the last two. Saturday’s win in the Thunderdome marks the first win in Santa Barbara for Fullerton since 1991 as the Titans improve to 7-11 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. The Gauchos drop to 6-12 overall and 1-4 in conference.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB struggled with consistency. After holding the Titans to 23 first half points and 29.2 percent shooting from the field, the Gauchos allowed Fullerton 44 second half points.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing because that first half was the style of play we’ve been waiting on the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “The game of basketball is two halves, and they made us pay for all of our mistakes in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Five players finished in double-figures for the Titans, and the team hit an incredible 10 shots from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making threes and everybody’s feeling it, you get in a certain type of rhythm,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “It gathers momentum for the team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also featured three players in double-figures with senior guard Melissa Zornig leading the Gaucho offense with 20 points. Mason added 18 points and a team-high eight rebounds while Onome Jemerigbe added a career-high 11 points.</p>\n<p>The loss concludes a three-game homestand for Santa Barbara. Next week, the Gauchos go on road, facing UC Irvine and UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/","id":552,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[551,550,549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Road Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated Riverside Thursday night before falling to Cal State Fullerton in a televised contest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The ability to close out games has become an area of concern for the UCSB men’s basketball team as the Gauchos finished this weekend with a 1-1 mark. UCSB defeated UC Riverside Thursday in overtime despite giving up a 17-point second half lead before falling Saturday night to Cal State Fullerton in a failed comeback attempt.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara defeated Riverside 68-65 on Thursday and fell to Fullerton 74-72 in a televised game Saturday night, bringing its record to 12-6 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. Saturday’s loss snapped a three-game winning streak for the Gauchos, placing them in a three-way tie for third place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In a game televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket, UCSB came out flat on Saturday, trailing by as many as 12 points in the second half. The Gauchos rallied, however, primarily behind the play of junior center Alan Williams. Big Al recorded 16 of his 26 points in the second half, adding along nine rebounds, two steals and two blocks in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With 2:20 remaining in the contest, UCSB took its first and only lead of the game at 70-68 when Big Al converted a three-point play. Fullerton senior guard Michael Williams then sank a three-pointer with 32 seconds remaining to give the Titans a 71-70 lead.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell’s three-point attempt with 23 seconds remaining raddled in and out twice before bouncing out and into Fullerton’s possession. Santa Barbara was forced to foul and Fullerton made the first of two free throws before missing the second.</p>\n<p>Off the missed free throw, the Gauchos pushed the ball up the court to freshman guard Eric Childress who missed a contested layup with 12 seconds remaining. UCSB was once again forced to foul, leading to two Titan free throws that put the game out of reach for the Gauchos. Fullerton improved to 7-12 overall and 2-3 in the Big West with the victory.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Alex Harris led the Titans with 22 points, while Michael Williams added 19 points, six rebounds and eight assists in a game-high 38 minutes of play. Fullerton shot 45 percent from beyond the arc with Harris and Williams converting four three-point field goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 16 points and five rebounds for UCSB, while junior guard Zalmico Harmon tallied eight points and 10 assists without committing a turnover. Boswell added 11 points off the bench, finishing the game 3-7 in three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>While UCSB came out slow in the first half on Saturday, Thursday’s contest against Riverside was the exact opposite. The Gauchos rushed out to an 11-point halftime lead, building that margin to 17 points within the first two minutes of the second half.</p>\n<p>Riverside slowly chipped away at the lead, however, using two separate 8-0 runs to tie the game at 50 with 8:23 remaining in the game. UCSB built a 60-54 lead with just over two minutes remaining, but the Highlanders rallied once again, closing the half on a 6-0 run.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taylor Johns was fouled with five seconds remaining and his Riverside team trailing 60-59. With a chance to give the Highlanders a late-game lead, Johns made the first free throw but missed the second, avoiding what could have been an epic collapse for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the overtime period, six of the eight points UCSB scored came by the way of free throws. Bryson scored the final four points of the game for Santa Barbara, an impressive feat considering he had all of one point scored in regulation.</p>\n<p>With a chance to tie the game, Riverside freshman guard Sam Finley missed a three-point jumper with one second remaining to secure the 68-65 win for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Big Al led UCSB with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Harmon and sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added 11 points. Boswell added 10 points off the bench for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Chris Patton led Riverside with 23 points behind an impressive 10-13 night shooting. Finley added 20 points and Johns pitched in with nine points and 11 rebounds for the Highlanders. Including a Saturday victory over Cal Poly, Riverside now holds a 7-13 record and a 2-4 mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Irvine Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/","id":551,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[550,549,548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Riding the Momentum","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BBALL-cover-photo-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BBALL-cover-photo-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels To UC Riverside Having Won Eight of its Last 10 Games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Heading into this weekend’s road games, the UCSB men’s basketball team has already matched last season’s win total and has won eight of its last 10 games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to continue a stretch of solid play when they travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday and Cal State Fullerton Saturday in a televised contest.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the backend of a three-game road trip with an 11-5 overall record and 2-1 mark in Big West play.

Closing games is big for us, so if we clean that up a little bit we definitely feel confident for Riverside and Fullerton this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has won its two most recent games after dropping the conference opener to Cal Poly, rebounding with a home victory over Long Beach State before a road victory at Cal State Northridge, the first game of the Gauchos’ three-game road trip.</p>\n<p>In last week’s victories, sophomore guard Michael Bryson shot an incredible 12-16 while garnering his second Big West Player of the Week honor this season.</p>\n<p>“It feels great [to be honored]. We got two big wins that were really necessary for us to get after losing to Cal Poly,” Bryson said. “Me being able to be a part of those wins was definitely great.”</p>\n<p>Bryson’s play was pivotal to the Gauchos’ success last week, as leading scorer Alan Williams was limited to an average of 14 points in the two contests. The junior center leads UCSB and the Big West with 22.8 points per game, good for fifth in the entire nation.</p>\n<p>Big Al also ranks sixth in the nation with 11 rebounds per game and is second in the Big West at 2.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“We want other guys to step up. We saw the problem when it was just Al in a game where everybody else just couldn’t seem to get it going,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It’s a group conversation about how we need to get other people involved, we need other people to step up, make plays, be aggressive, and I think we did a much better job of that the last two games.”</p>\n<p>When scouting Riverside, Big Al and the rest of the UCSB big men will certainly face a tough matchup against sophomore Taylor Johns. The 6’7” forward leads Riverside in points at 12.8 per game while ranking third in the conference in rebounds (8.2) and blocks per game (1.9).</p>\n<p>“I make it a mission to stop whoever I’m matched up against,” Brewe said. “If I am matched up against Riverside’s big guy, it’s going to be my personal mission. I know it’s Al’s mission and Sam’s mission to really stop him and keep him contained. That’s going to be part of the game plan, and we feel like we have the physical presence and the ability to do so.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lost four of their last five games, the lone victory being an 81-69 comeback win over UC Davis. UCSB split the season series with Riverside last season with each team winning on its home floor.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’re not going to overlook them. We need to be edgy, and we’ve already lost a home game — that puts you in a little bit of a hole,” Coach Williams said. “We need to win as many road contests as possible. You want to be in the championship hunt, it’s about how many road games can you win, and we need to make sure we take advantage of any opportunity we have on the road.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton, meanwhile, has also lost four of its last five contests with the only victory coming in a 78-73 home contest against Riverside. The Gauchos also split last year’s contest against the Titans, winning at home and falling on the road.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Riverside on Thursday is scheduled for 7 p.m., while Saturday’s contest at Fullerton is set for a 7:30 p.m. start on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/","id":554,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[553,552,551],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 74-61 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be early in the season, but the UCSB women’s basketball team could not afford another loss.</p>\n<p>Going into last night’s game against UC Riverside, the Gauchos were 0-3 in the Big West and had lost eight of their last nine.

Riverside, on the other hand, remains the lone winless team in league at 0-5 and 4-14 overall.</p>\n<p>After struggling to start league, averaging just 9.3 points in Santa Barbara’s first three league matches compared to 18.2 points per game during the preseason, senior guard Nicole Nesbit returned to her typical offensive force. She led Santa Barbara with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists with eight of her points coming during a game-deciding 12-0 run for the Gauchos in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig also stepped up for UCSB, tallying 16 points, including eight straight points for the Gauchos down the stretch to seal the game.</p>\n<p>However, unlike most games, the Gauchos received offensive production from more than just its seniors. Jasmine ware added 12 points and 11 rebounds, her first career double-double, while junior center Clair Watkins and freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe added eight and seven points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I’d say it’s about time,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said of Ware’s effort. “I understand the expectations when Jasmine came in here were the same as Clair; everyone thinks it’s supposed to be instant and sometimes it’s a process for kids. We always knew. Jas has great athletic ability and a knack for rebounding. Tonight she stepped up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Riverside 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards, which led to 23 second-chance points. The Gauchos also outscored the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“In practice we constantly go over rebounding drills over and over, so I think just taking the drills that we do in practice and moving it to the game is what it’s about,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>After missing a multitude of easy layups throughout the first half, Santa Barbara found its offensive stride in the second half. Down 51-50 with just over 17 minutes remaining, Nesbit completed a three point play to spark a 12-0 run for UCSB. Nesbit earned two three point plays during the spurt.</p>\n<p>“Nic’s a gamer and she knows she’s going to get most team’s best defender on her most nights, but she has the ability to score in multiple ways and she found her legs tonight,” Mitchell said. “Her teammates have confidence in her as well as the coaching staff.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Riverside crept back into the game, going on a 6-0 run to decrease the margin to just five points. For the Gauchos, another senior responded, with Zornig dropping eight straight points to keep the Highlanders at bay and seal the victory.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, Brittany Crain continued her offensive dominance in the Big West, scoring 19 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will finish its three game homestand tomorrow when it hosts Cal State Fullerton. Tip-off is set for 7.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The team has lost eight of its last nine, with its last victory dating back to almost a month ago when UCSB defeated Seattle Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>“I think we all know our potential, so it’s frustrating, but at the same time, we’re staying positive,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “There’s still a lot of season left. As long as we all stay positive and stay on the same page, I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>One of two teams still winless in conference, the Gauchos need to make a run quickly in the ultra-competitive Big West this year.</p>\n<p>The other team still chasing its first conference victory is Riverside. The Highlanders are also extremely hungry for a victory having lost 10 consecutive games. They enter the Thunderdome with a 4-13 overall and a 0-4 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>“We’re both backed in the corner as far as our record and Big West standings,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “There’s no panic, but there is a sense of urgency. We just need to take care of business at home the next two games, and we’ll be at the same record we started out at this point last year. We know what to do. It’s just a matter of buckling down and getting it done.”</p>\n<p>One fatal flaw for UCSB in Big West contests so far has been falling behind by large margins and needing to play catch up late in the game.</p>\n<p>“There’s no reason for us to dig ourselves holes like that,” Mitchell said. “This team is a little uncomfortable with who to go to and through when we need a basket, so everyone puts themselves on an island and tries to do it on their own. You can never do that. It takes five players on the court, so they need to learn to trust each other.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ offense is plenty capable of scoring, ranking first in the Big West in field-goal percentage the majority of the year, Santa Barbara knows that defense is what wins it games and that they must return to their defensive prowess from previous years. Right now, UCSB ranks fifth in scoring defense, giving up 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Opening up conference, we knew we had to write it across our chest as being a defensive team first,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “That will lead to offense and transition baskets, but it has to start with defense. We know that.”</p>\n<p>Commanding the attention of any defense in the conference is sophomore guard Brittany Crain. Crain leads the Hinglanders in virtually every category, but also tops the Big West in scoring with 19.7 points per game, including 22.0 points during conference play. She also ranks first in conference in steals with 2.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to stick to fundamental defense, just really bother her,” Nesbit said. “You try to make her job difficult and contest her shots and stay in front of her.”</p>\n<p>However, the Highlanders do feature four players averaging double-figures. One player that the Gauchos will keep an eye on is senior center Natasha Hadley.

Our offense is fine this year.

Northridge’s defense bothered the Gauchos’ offense the entirety of the game with Santa Barbara struggling to get a quality shot off. Only one player for UCSB finished in double-figures with Nesbit tallying 13 points and six rebounds on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yet, this is Carlene Mitchell’s team and per usual for her, the problem was on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>“Some of (the offensive troubles) can be pressing too much. Some of that can be taking the wrong shots. I don’t worry about it,” Mitchell said. “It is the defensive side of it. I pulled the stats out from last year for the team and last year we scored 45, we scored 55 and maybe 47 against Northridge. So, here’s that double edge sword that we scored 70 in the first three games and most of the first half of the season, so offense is going to be the question, but my question is, ‘how can we score 46 but also win the game?’”</p>\n<p>Northridge shot 44.8 percent from the field. The Matadors also outscored the Gauchos 34-10 in the paint and outrebounded them 45-31.</p>\n<p>After allowing Northridge to go on the 17-2 run in the first half, Santa Barbara then didn’t contain the Matadors to open the second half, allowing them to start the final period on an 8-1 run, which eventually reached a game-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>“We know we need to stick to our defensive principles,” Nesbit said. “At times, we have lapses in defense, but we know as long as we continue to turn up the intensity on defense and stick to the fundamentals that we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Needing to come from behind has become a recent trend for UCSB, falling behind by large deficits in all three Big West games, and the team hasn’t fared well, going 0-3 in those games.</p>\n<p>“As we continue on the season, we need to learn to put two halves together,” Nesbit said. “We sometimes come out flat in the second half and that tends to snowball, but we know that we need to come out with intensity in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Individually, Janae Sharpe led her team with 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists. She was one of three players in double-figures for Northridge. 6’3’’ sophomore center Bernadette Fong, who averages just 5.8 points per game, made UCSB pay down low, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>The loss snaps a 14 game win streak over Northridge and emphasized the struggles of UCSB recently. The team has dropped eight of its last nine games with its last win coming on Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the Gauchos remain winless in Big West play, dropping to 5-11 overall and 0-3 in conference. Northridge, on the other hand, improves to 7-11 overall and 3-1 in league.</p>\n<p>“We have the answers within us, but its how do we put that together?” Mitchell said. “Talent alone is never enough. I’ll continue to say in our conference, we’re one of the most talented, but at this point, we haven’t meshed as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to action Thursday against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/","id":579,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[578,577,576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Long Beach State in ESPN Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB snapped a five-game losing streak to Long Beach State on Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It had been three seasons and five straight games that Long Beach State had UCSB’s number.

The Gauchos held Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and came out victorious despite committing 19 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was important for us to get a win at home. We feel like we shouldn’t lose at home in league for the rest of this year,” sophomore forward Mitch Brewe said. “It was tough coming off Cal Poly, we were lackadaisical and it was a tough game. But we rallied around the crowd, our teammates and coaching staff, and we really came out ready to defend our home court.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach opened the game with a quick 12-6 lead before UCSB responded with an 11-0 run powered by five straight points from sophomore guard Michael Bryson. The Gauchos would lead for the remainder of the half until Long Beach took a brief 22-21 lead with under four minutes left in the half. Tied at 24 and with the final possession, freshman point guard Eric Childress made a brilliant pass to sophomore forward Sam Beeler who slammed the ball home a second before the halftime buzzer to give UCSB a 26-24 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>A quick 9-0 start to the second half stretched the Gaucho lead and UCSB continued to push the 49ers, eventually building a 50-31 lead with just under nine minutes remaining in the contest. Long Beach would rally to as close as eight points with over four minutes left to play by forcing numerous turnovers, but the Gauchos quickly shut the door on any comeback hopes.</p>\n<p>Bryson twice drove baseline and dunked the ball over Long Beach defenders, sandwiching a Sportscenter worthy dunk by sophomore forward Taran Brown that put the game away for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was really happy with the fact that there was some aggressive straight line drives by Michael and Taran, that [Zalmico] was more aggressive,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[I was happy] everybody else on the team felt the need to step up and be more of a weapon offensively because we put too much on pressure on Al when we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Alan Williams who entered the game third in the nation averaging over 24 points per game was held to 12 points in the contest, his second fewest this season. Despite Williams’s lack of scoring, the big man still managed to pull down 15 rebounds, improving his pre-game average of 11.1 per game which ranked sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>Bryson finished the contest with a team-high 13 points to go along with nine rebounds for the Gauchos. Brewe, meanwhile, registered a career-high 12 points and finished 2-2 from behind the three-point line, a recent addition to the power forward’s game.</p>\n<p>“It was important that we had other players make plays,” Coach Williams said. “I think what Long Beach watched was the Cal Poly game where other players didn’t make plays and Al had to carry the load with 33 and 15. What I liked best is Al only gets 12 tonight but he has 15 rebounds again. He stayed after it.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was certainly a factor in this game as junior guard Zalmico Harmon scored seven points to go along with a game-high nine assists for the Gauchos. Long Beach junior point guard Michael Caffey led the team with 21 points but his impact was matched by Harmon’s intensity on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I thought Z was very aggressive and we addressed that and asked him to raise his aggression level. Z has been good as an assist to turnover guy on the year,” Coach Williams said. “For us, the idea that Z was aggressive, that Z scored seven points and gets nine assists, those are good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell finished with eight points and shot 2-5 from behind the arc, while Brown scored six points and pulled down four rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite turning the ball over 12 more times than Long Beach, the Gauchos were efficient with the shot opportunities they had, shooting over 50 percent for the game and 40 percent from the three.</p>\n<p>Long Beach finished 5-27 from three-point land as only one 49er finished the game in double-digit scoring. The 49ers struggled against Santa Barbara’s zone defense as the Gauchos closed down on shooters and forced Long Beach to take plenty of contested outside jumpers.</p>\n<p>“The zone really affected them. The rotations we’ve been working on constantly in practice really came into play in that game,” Brewe said. “And you won’t see a Long Beach team shoot 30 percent very often.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s victory ended a three-game homestand for UCSB in which the Gauchos twice saw large crowds support the team.
