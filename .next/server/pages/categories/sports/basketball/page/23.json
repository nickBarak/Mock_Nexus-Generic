We got sloppy with how we were catching the ball; they catch it standing still and don’t know they slide both of them. Those are your feet!”</p>\n<p>Swaying Henrickson’s frustrated postgame response was the Gauchos’ slew of traveling violations which primarily resulted in their 25 turnovers on the evening. For the sixth consecutive game, UCSB finished with 20-plus turnovers as Riverside outscored Santa Barbara 29-10 in points off turnovers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s miscues helped ignite the scoring onslaught of Highlanders’ potent guard Brittany Crain. The senior finished with a season-high 33 points on 13-24 shooting from the field, 2-6 from three-point range. It was the 10<sup>th</sup> career 30-point game for the reigning Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>After having its streak ended, UCSB owns a 4-12 overall and 1-1 conference record. UCR, alongside UC Davis, remains one of the final two teams with an undefeated conference record at 2-0 and improved to 9-7 overall on the season.</p>\n<p>While Crain torched the Gauchos for a season-high in points, she was also supported by the excellent play of backcourt colleague senior guard Annelise Ito and redshirt junior forward Réjane Verin in the paint. The trio set a season-high in scoring as well with a combined total of 66 points. Ito nearly tallied her third double-double of the season with 17 points and nine rebounds to go with four assists and three steals. Most notably, Verin fell not too far of her first career triple-double with 16 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds to cap off an 8-11 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>The two helped set the tone early, scoring six of the team’s points in its 8-0 run to open the first quarter. UCR quickly took advantage of its size down low which eventually prompted the subbing in of junior center Je Zhé Newton for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As Newton’s size helped slow down the Highlanders’ attack in the paint, UCSB gradually trimmed its deficit behind the scoring of junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore guard Makala Roper. Jemerigbe scored seven of her 10 points in the quarter while Roper notched five, bringing the Gauchos within one at 19-20 with a three-pointer. A make at the free-throw line by Newton tied the score at 20-20 to end the first period with the Gauchos shooting over 50 percent.</p>\n<p>Although, Newton possessed the size advantage in the paint, she could not convert on what should have been relatively easy layups. She registered 10 points on 3-6 shooting and was 4-11 at the free-throw line in 19 minutes of play. While Newton did have a late start to the season due to injury, the opportunity to become UCSB’s starting center await but she has underperformed when given the playing time.</p>\n<p>“Is she an option to start? No,” Henrickson said. “She’s got to give us some more. There just should be more improvement, that’s my frustration. It’s not like we don’t try to throw it to her, we try to, and we’ll continue to try to. We have to have somebody down there.”</p>\n<p>In addition to UCSB’s absence of offense in the post, its shot attempts from mid-range and behind the three-point line would not fall either as Santa Barbara scored just five points in the second quarter. The Highlanders scored 22 points in the quarter with just one field goal and free-throw not being by a member of their “Big 3” to enter halftime with a 42-25 lead.</p>\n<p>“They [UCR] screen and move, and run their offense high,” Henrickson said. “They’re a rhythm—pass, catch, swing it and they score pretty quick. They adjusted; when we got in them, they drove. When we didn’t, they just threw the ball over our head.”</p>\n<p>In spite of facing a near 20-point deficit, UCSB’s effort to start off the third quarter expressed signs of a team that believed it could come back. Senior guard Jasmine Ware led the Gauchos’ attempt, scoring 12 of her team-high 14 points off the bench as she fell just shy of a double-double with eight rebounds. Yet, her effort alone could not prevent Santa Barbara from trailing 42-63, entering the fourth quarter. Sophomore forward Taylor Farris made her first start of the season, but concluded the game 0-2 from the field with zero points.</p>\n<p>UCR continued its dominance in the fourth quarter, specifically from behind the perimeter. The Highlanders drained three-straight threes during the quarter, with Crain making two back-to-back. She helped Riverside seal its 30-point victory with 15 points in the final quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB will search for its first road victory of the season in its first conference away game against Cal State Fullerton on Thursday, Jan. 14<sup>th</sup>. The Gauchos will continue their road trip at Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Jan. 16<sup>th</sup>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67291\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-three-game-streak-ended-in-83-53-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67291\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-three-game-streak-ended-in-83-53-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-three-game-streak-ended-in-83-53-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-three-game-streak-ended-in-83-53-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-three-game-streak-ended-in-83-53-loss-to-uc-riverside/","id":387,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[386,385,384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chiefs Headed for Underdog Cinderella Run?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=355%2C193&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=600%2C193&ssl=1","description":"The Kansas City have not won a playoff game in 22 seasons.

Six days later Kansas City lost its week six match-up against the Vikings dropping its record to 1-5.</p>\n<p>At the time, their chances of making the playoffs was zero percent. Hope seemed gone, analysts said they were done, fans were hoping for a high draft pick and management was hoping they would get to keep their jobs. That’s when safety Eric Berry stepped up.</p>\n<p>Berry knows all about overcoming adversity. In 2011, after a solid rookie campaign, the former Tennessee safety tore his ACL and was out for the season. He ultimately came back in 2012 and continued his great play and became recognized as one of the best young safeties.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in late 2014 tragedy struck Berry again, but this time much worse, as he was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Once again, he fought back. “Fear nothing, attack everything.” This is what Berry said right after he beat cancer less than a year later. He was playing by the second week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Just like Berry, The Chiefs chose to fight for what they truly wanted, a playoff spot and a chance to win their first Super Bowl since 1969. By the end of week 16, that dream came true. After defeating the Browns on December 27th, Kansas City secured the fifth seed in the AFC.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have rallied off 10 straight victories and are a team that everybody would like to avoid. They are giving up 13.2 points per game since week 5 something that has only been accomplished five times the turn of the century, of which two of those teams made it to the conference championship.</p>\n<p>Another reason for the great defensive play is the emergence of rookie Marcus Peters. In 2014, the Chiefs defense combined for six interceptions on the season. In 2015, Peters had eight interceptions by himself.</p>\n<p>It also helps that Quarterback Alex Smith is playing the best football of his career this year. He has already set career highs in yards and advanced metrics like Total QBR. And even without its star RB, Kansas City still ranks 6th in the NFL in rushing behind Charcandrick West.</p>\n<p>Analysts make the case that the reason for the Chiefs rise is the fact that their schedule got easier after week 7. Since then, the combined records of the 10 teams Kansas City has played is 67-91. However, it should be noted that this is the NFL, no game is an “easy” win. The Chiefs had to win 10 straight games, a feat that only on two other NFL teams accomplished therefore implying this isn’t something that happens everyday.</p>\n<p>I’ll repeat that by week six Kansas City had a zero percent chance of making the playoffs and were 300:1 odds in Vegas to make the Super Bowl. Fast forward to today and the Chiefs are in the playoffs with now 14:1 odds to make the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I am wrong for assuming most teams would’ve given up once your record falls to 1-5 in the NFL and that most fans were already ready for the next season. However, when your team leader is a man who overcame a devastating illness that kills millions of people each year, how could you ever possibly justify giving up on him and on the season?</p>\n<p>The Chiefs did something that has only been done once in NFL history and that is make the playoffs after starting the season 1-5 or worse. Eric Berry did something that, unfortunately, many people cannot do, and that is beat cancer. Both underdogs will be looking to end the long 22-year drought without a playoff win that has plagued Kansas City and its fans.</p>\n<p>Something tells me this is the year that its going to happen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

We work hard every day, we all get along and it’s more fun this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shot a season-high 50 percent from behind the three-point line, making 9 of 18 attempts. It finished with its second-best field goal percentage of the year as well at 55.6 percent, just shy of its season-high (57.1 percent) against La Verne.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Gradually becoming the Gauchos’ “go-to” player is sophomore guard Makala Roper, who led the team Thursday night with 19 points and was 4-6 from behind the perimeter. Helping solidify UCSB’s frontcourt as of recently has been sophomore forwards Chaya Durr and Taylor Farris.</p>\n<p>In back-to-back games, Farris has played over 30 minutes and scored in double-figures, finishing with 14 points on Thursday. It was a solid outing for Durr as she earned her first career double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds to go with four steals.</p>\n<p>It was a compelling victory for UCSB as it ended a nine-game losing streak to Cal Poly, its first victory against the program since March 5, 2011. The Gauchos had not beat the Mustangs in the Thunderdome since Feb. 27 2010.</p>\n<p>“It’s the best thing for the kids, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “This is the best thing for the players, the fans and the program. The best thing is in the locker room. Just to watch them smile, laugh and celebrate is the best part. And, it’s a rival game so it’s even better.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s win improved the Gauchos’ overall record to 4-11, 1-0 to start conference play. Cal Poly is now at the .500 mark with a 7-7 overall and 0-1 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded baskets to begin the game, but a 6-0 UCSB run gave it a chance to distance itself from Cal Poly at a lead of 15-8. The trading of buckets continued as a jump shot by sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe brought Cal Poly within three at 15-18. However, a three-pointer off the bank of the backboard by freshman guard Coco Miller ended the first quarter with the Gauchos up, 21-15.</p>\n<p>Miller’s long distance make was the start of an 11-0 run that flourished in the beginning of the second quarter, forming into a 29-15 Santa Barbara lead. A jump shot by senior point guard Lisa Marie Sanchez brought Cal Poly within single-figures at 29-20, but the Gauchos went on to enter halftime with a 38-20 lead.</p>\n<p>Setting up UCSB’s lead was its stellar defense in the first half. It held Cal Poly to a 34.6 shooting percentage and strayed away from sending the Mustangs to the free throw line, not allowing any attempts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos recorded 11 steals in the first half, their most in a half this season. Their tremendous defense resulted in Cal Poly scoring just five points in the second quarter as UCSB held the Mustangs scoreless from the 5:23 mark to the closing of the period.</p>\n<p>“Our best offense was our defense,” Henrickson said. “It helped us that Poly played like some teams we had played, so it wasn’t a whole different scheme, offensively and defensively. It’s contagious when you start making shots. But, in the huddles all we kept talking about was our defense. That’s what got us going, that’s where you get juice and momentum.”</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t let up in the second half, responding with back-to-back three-pointers by Roper and Miller.  However, the Mustangs turned to a full-court press defense in the second half in hopes of making a comeback. To Cal Poly’s benefit, the press worked as UCSB turned the ball over 18 times in the second half to conclude with a total of 27 on the night.</p>\n<p>“Give them [Cal Poly] credit,” Henrickson said. “They’re not a pressing team, but they had to do that to get back in it. We didn’t attack that as aggressively as they attacked us.”</p>\n<p>The improvement on defense led to Cal Poly cutting UCSB’s lead as junior forward Hannah Gilbert guided the Mustangs back from behind. For the second consecutive game, she registered another 20-point game with 22 points on 9-13 shooting and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Still, Santa Barbara earned its largest lead of 51-22 in the third quarter, but saw it diminish in the fourth quarter as the Mustangs managed to trim the Gauchos’ lead to a 10-point deficit of 65-55 with 4:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Bringing UCSB’s lead to such a deficit was Cal Poly’s Sanchez, whose scoring outburst of three-straight three-pointers sparked the Mustangs’ 11-0 run. Sanchez finished with 15 points on a 60 percent shooting effort and 3-5 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 34-18 in the final quarter. Down 10, sustaining the Mustangs’ possible comeback was UCSB’s poor free throw shooting in the fourth quarter. The Gauchos shot 4-13 at the line, but were relieved of their free throw woes by a Roper three-pointer which handed UCSB a 68-55 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the Mustangs’ scoring surge to end the game, their improvement in performance came too late as their 26 turnovers had delayed their offense earlier in the game. Some late baskets would allow Cal Poly to reduce the Gauchos’ lead, but it never managed to get within single-figures again and was defeated 78-67.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain at home for its next conference game versus UC Riverside on Saturday, Jan. 9 at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67254\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67254\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/","id":385,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[384,383,382],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2015-16 Big West Men’s Basketball Conference Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-West-Preview.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-West-Preview.jpg?resize=599%2C414&ssl=1","description":"  Full of resolutions and new beginnings, the New Year can be considered a reset button for many.

The Gauchos, who were predicted to finish second in the Big West this season behind only UC Irvine, open up conference play this Saturday at Hawaii, winners of four straight and looking to put their early season struggles even further behind them.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for us to play. We’re finally hitting the ground running right now coming back from break,” senior guard Michael Bryson said. “We’ve done what we needed to do these past games. As long as we stay with the process we’ll be fine. I’m excited to see what these younger guys can do and who’s going to step up come conference time.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a successful 2014-15 campaign in which it went 19-14 overall and finished tied for the second-best conference record at 11-5. At the helm is 18-year Head Coach Bob Williams, a three-time Big West Coach of the Year who has led the Gauchos to three Big West Tournament titles and is currently the longest tenured coach on the west coast.</p>\n<p>After losing the program’s focal point from the past three seasons in center “Big Al” Alan Williams — UCSB’s all-time leading rebounder and second all-time leading scorer — Santa Barbara has adapted and changed its look with a faster-paced attack and guard-heavy lineup led by Bryson, their sole representative on the All-Conference Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to just a 2-7 start to the season, but have bounced back to take their last four by an average of 22 points per game and currently sit at 6-7. They shouldn’t feel too uncomfortable opening up Big West play with road games at Hawaii and Cal Poly as they have played 10 of their 13 games this season away from home.</p>\n<p>“The key was just keeping our head up. After losing a couple games in a row, we wanted to just switch it up — play a little faster and see what we can do — and it’s working well for us,” junior point guard Eric Childress said. “We’re pressuring the ball up a little harder and getting out and running the floor. Right now it’s 0-0 and from this point on we’ve just got to worry about conference and trying to get to the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Taking over as the team’s top offensive option in his fourth and final year at UCSB, Bryson, who was named First Team All-Big West in 2014-15, has not disappointed. The 6’4” guard out of Sacramento, CA is coming off the third Big West Player of the Week Award of his career after leading the Gauchos to a perfect 3-0 record heading into the New Year.</p>\n<p>Last Monday, Bryson led the way with 17 points and five boards to help give Santa Barbara an 83-78 win over Washington and its first road win over a Pac-12 team since 2003. Just two days later at Seattle, Bryson was scorching hot from deep, tying a school record by knocking down nine three-pointers. With an impressive 36 points and 13 rebounds, both of which were career-highs, he also recorded his third career double-double.</p>\n<p>“[Michael’s] been getting better and better. He’s been getting more physical, a lot more vocal, trying to get to the rim more often and get fouled,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He had a huge game at Seattle and played well at Washington. He is our guy.”</p>\n<p>Backing up Bryson in the backcourt are point guards Gabe Vincent and Eric Childress. After getting off to a slow start this season, Vincent, last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year, has found his shot of late, knocking down 10-22 (45.5 percent) of his threes over the past four games. He is the team’s second-highest scorer, averaging 12.3 ppg while leading the team with 1.2 steals a night.</p>\n<p>Alongside him this season has been Childress, a player who doesn’t need to score in order to impact a game. A perfect example of this was when his only basket in a game at Nebraska-Omaha was a game-winning tip-in to give the Gauchos their second victory back in November.</p>\n<p>After two years of coming off the bench, the third-year guard has started every game this season, doing all the little things on both sides of the floor. He has five or more assists in UCSB’s last three games, leads the team in both assists per game (3.8) and assist-turnover ratio (2.4) and has knocked down nine of his last 12 three-point attempts, shooting a team-best 52.9 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for UCSB, a knee injury to forward John Green last month will keep him out potentially until early February. The fifth-year senior has battled injuries for much of his collegiate career but was finally able to stay healthy last season on his way to being named Honorable Mention All-Big West. He is the team’s third-leading scorer at 11.7 ppg and second-leading rebounder with 5.7 rpg, but has struggled with his shot this season, making just 20.7 percent from deep and 35 percent overall.</p>\n<p>In Green’s absence, forward Maxwell Kupchak has started the last five games, showing good signs of maturation in his freshman year with averages of 5.5 rebounds and 4.5 assists in his last two outings.</p>\n<p>6’10” centers senior Sam Beeler and sophomore Alex Hart along with senior forward Mitch Brewe round out the UCSB frontcourt. Beeler has been extremely efficient inside, leading the Big West with a 72.2 shooting percentage, and is coming off a perfect 7-7 shooting night against Point Loma in which he scored a career-high 14 points. Hart is second on the team at 51.2 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Brewe has continued to play tough inside, as he has his whole career, chipping in with a solid 8.5 points and 5.2 rebounds per game through the last four.</p>\n<p>Finally, senior guard DaJuan Smith has come alive in recent games, going 8/12 from the field in the last three games after making just four shots in his first 10 appearances this year.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Gauchos’ biggest weakness this year has been their inability to get to the free throw line. Although they rank second in conference, knocking down 71.4 percent of their attempts, they are in last place with just 199 attempts. That mark puts them 49 attempts behind eighth ranked Cal Poly and 136 behind top-ranked CSUN.</p>\n<p>“Just our aggressiveness,” Bryson said when asked what the team needs to improve on most. “We’re still not getting to the line as much as we need to, we’re still fouling too much, not playing defense with our hands, not getting in help position. That’s going to be a constant process all the way to the end of the season. Hopefully we can be at our full stride when it comes to March.”</p>\n<p>The early-season shooting struggles which plagued the Gauchos seem to be behind them for now, but coach Williams believes they still have some key things to work on if they are going to shine and make a run for the title this conference season.</p>\n<p>“Mentally we’ve got to just continue to grow and get tougher,” Williams said. “I still think we have a long way to go. First you’ve got to understand your role, then you’ve got to accept your role and excel in it. I don’t think we’re excelling in our roles yet and I think that’s the next phase for us.”</p>\n<p>The path to glory begins this Saturday at 9 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center in Hawaii.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine- Sean White </strong></p>\n<p>It was a historic season for the UC Irvine men’s basketball team last year. The reigning Big West Champions concluded the season 21-13 overall, 11-5 in conference play to earn their first ever bid to the NCAA Tournament with a 67-58 win over Hawai’i in the conference tournament championship. The 13th-seeded Anteaters nearly upset fourth-seeded Louisville in the Second Round but were defeated 55-57.</p>\n<p>For the third consecutive season, Irvine was selected to win the conference title in the Big West men’s basketball preseason poll. The Anteaters are 11-5 overall, earning their most notable wins in the Don Haskins Sun Bowl Invitational as champions of the tournament. Although UCI has achieved a better mark than its 7-7 non-conference finish last season, the Anteaters fell short against credible opponents such as Oregon, Saint Mary’s, Evansville and No. 1 Kansas.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t beaten the teams that are better than we are,” Head Coach Russell Turner said. “I’m surprised that we didn’t rise up and beat a couple of them, but we do have 11 wins against an incredibly tough schedule.”</p>\n<p>Three starters from last year’s team returned for the current season. Senior guard Alex Young, junior guard Luke Nelson and junior center Mamadou Ndiaye can all be accredited for the Anteaters’ progression.</p>\n<p>Tied for college basketball’s tallest player in the nation, Ndiaye is UCI’s mismatch for opponents in the paint with his seven-foot-six inch stature. He leads the Anteaters in scoring and rebounding with averages of 12.1 ppg and 7.3 rebounds per game. Nonetheless, Ndiaye is UC Irvine’s top shot blocker with a total of 43, ranking sixth in the country. He also ranks 17th in the nation in both blocks per game (2.69), field goal percentage (66.4) and has been named Big West men’s basketball player of the week once this season after a double-double performance of 17 points and a tied career-high of 14 rebounds along with four blocks against Utah State.</p>\n<p>Complementing Ndiaye is the experienced backcourt of Young and Nelson. Young recently made history by becoming UCI’s all-time leader in career assists with a current total of 479. While Nelson is shooting 27.4 percent from beyond the arc, he ranks eighth in career three-point field goals made in program history with 150.</p>\n<p>Irvine is well deserving of its third-straight first-place prediction, but must try to reestablish the same execution on defense in pursuit of a top finish. The Anteaters ranked third in the nation last season in opponent field goal percentage, holding teams to a 37.4 shooting percentage and ranked 38th in the country in scoring defense allowing just 63.7 ppg.</p>\n<p>“We’ve built our program around being a defensive team,” Turner said. “We feel like our defense displays and reflects our togetherness, toughness and determination. That’s what worked for us in the tournament last year and enabled us to win the regular season the year before.”</p>\n<p>The quest to repeat begins on Thursday, Jan. 7th as the Anteaters will host UC Davis at 7:00 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii- Daniel Moebus-Bowles </strong></p>\n<p>Under new leadership in Head Coach Eran Ganot, the University of Hawaii men’s basketball team played with an unmatched vengeance in its nonconference portion of the season to put it atop the Big West rankings. Entering the conference schedule, the Rainbow Warriors hold an outstanding record of 11-2, with one of their losses coming by only three points to the then No. 3 Oklahoma Sooners, who now sit at No. 2.</p>\n<p>Ganot, a former assistant coach and director of the Rainbow Warrior program, returned to Hawaii this season just in time to aid a program that has experienced adversity in the previous few months. Due to a violation of NCAA regulations in regards to student-athletes, the ‘Bows were forced to vacate all wins from the past two seasons, lose scholarships, and will be banned from postseason play in the next few seasons.</p>\n<p>The team’s former head coach was let go following the implementation of these sanctions, and Ganot was chosen to lead this program in need. Considering the winning record and the strong performances from his team so far, Ganot was clearly the perfect candidate for the job.</p>\n<p>“Coach Ganot is a very experienced and intelligent coach, not just with the way he plays the game, but also in the way he gets the team to play,” Assistant Coach Adam Jacobsen said. “He has been in our program before and having him back now has truly benefitted our team.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors have been led by a three-headed monster in scoring, rebounds and assists to this point in the season. Junior guard Aaron Valdes, junior center Stefan Jankovic and senior guard Roderick Bobbitt top the team in points as the only three averaging double figures. Of the three, the senior leader Bobbitt, has truly been the most outstanding, averaging 14 points, 5.8 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game while shooting 46.4 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Bobbitt has been a true standout on this successful team with his ability to not only score, but also distribute the ball and run the team from the guard position, making a versatile player that is a handful to defend. Bobbitt will surely be the player to watch as he rides an impressive hot streak into conference play. The senior has scored a minimum of 30 points in three of the team’s last four games and even played all 40 minutes in two of those matches.</p>\n<p>“If I had to describe Roderick Bobbitt in one word, I would call him a competitor,” Coach Jacobsen explained. “Along with being able to score and being a great passer, rebounder and defender, [Bobbitt] also is a huge presence on the court and he allows us to compete with top-ranked teams and players.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors will remain at Stan Sheriff Center for its next conference game versus UCSB on Saturday, Jan. 9 at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State- Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>With the departure of all five starters from last season, Head Coach Dan Monson has rebuilt his Long Beach State team around a core group of incoming transfers and young talent.</p>\n<p>“We are going to have to find our identity this year,” Monson said. “Mike [Caffey] and David [Samuels] were our leaders last year, but I’m excited to see where these new guys bring us this year.”</p>\n<p>While Monson’s new lineup propelled the 49ers to a 3-0 start this year with wins over BYU and Seton Hall, tough losses against powerhouse teams like No. 5 Virginia, No. 8 Arizona and No. 15 Duke have pinned the Beach with a record of 6-9.</p>\n<p>Although it hasn’t been the smoothest opening, there are some positives to take out of these rough matches. Maryland transfer Nick Faust and junior forward Travis Hammonds have emerged as the central weapons in Monson’s spread offense.<br>\nAfter three years at Maryland and sitting out the entire 2014-15 season, senior Nick Faust has taken the reigns as the leader of the Beach. A combo guard with a 6’6” frame, Faust will arguably be one of the main threats in the Big West this year due to his upside and range.</p>\n<p>Averaging 15.7 points per game, fourth best in conference, the former Terrapin has proven his scoring ability, finishing in double-figures 47 times under Maryland Head Coach Mark Turgeon. This year, Faust leads the 49ers in scoring in nine out of their 15 nonconference matches.</p>\n<p>Down on the block, forward Hammonds has improved his points per game average from 6.4 to 10.7 this year. The 6’6” combo forward had a career-night on Dec. 18 leading his team with 27 points and seven boards against Oregon.</p>\n<p>Lastly, coach Monson holds one more secret ingredient in freshman guard Noah Blackwell. The No. 25 California prospect by ESPN is averaging 19.5 minutes and 7.2 points per game and carried his 49ers in a hostile Cameron Indoor Stadium, going 7-12 from the floor for 19 points against Mike Krzyzewski and the Duke Blue Devils.</p>\n<p>The Beach opens up Big West play with a road game against Cal State Northridge on Jan. 6.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside- Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>UC Riverside looks like a team much improved this season, boasting a 9-7 record to this point. Despite the good start, the preseason media poll predicts that the Highlanders will finish fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is very good,” Head Coach Dennis Cutts said. “We had some success last year and we just want to build on that with the returning players we have.”</p>\n<p>Although they are predicted to finish with an average standing in the Big West, UCR may have the necessary pieces to possibly go deep in conference play and the tournament.</p>\n<p>The team is led by two preseason All-Conference players in senior guard Jaylen Bland and junior forward Taylor Johns. Johns is coming off a spectacular season in which he was top three in the conference in both scoring and rebounding as well as named All-Big West First Team.</p>\n<p>Bland is also coming off a great year in which he was named Big West Newcomer of the Year and led the conference in three-point shots made with 95. The senior guard is off to a hot start this year, averaging 16.3 points per contest, ranking first on his team and tying for second best in the conference.</p>\n<p>“They are great players — they can do it all,” Cutts said. “It’s nice to have two proven players lead our team.”</p>\n<p>The team as a whole has been great from behind the three-point line, shooting 37 percent, which is currently fourth best in the conference. They also do a solid job of rebounding, averaging 37 per game — again good for fourth best in the conference.</p>\n<p>However, the biggest reason for the Highlanders’ success is their play of the defensive side of the ball. They hold opponents to a 28 percent shooting average from beyond the arc — best in the conference — and a 39 percent shooting average from the field, thirdbest in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Right now we are confident,” Cutts said. “We are playing good basketball but we know we can improve. We are expecting a battle against Fullerton to start conference play.”<br>\nUC Riverside tips off conference play at the UCR Recreation Center against CSUF tonight at 7 p.m. The game will be streamed live on ESPN3.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly- Antonia Bird</strong></p>\n<p>While sustaining the legacy of becoming the first seventh-seeded team to win the Big West Conference Championship back in 2014, the Cal Poly men’s basketball team is anxious to enter conference play in hopes of making its second appearance ever in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly currently stands at 5-7 overall, a respectable record for the Mustangs considering they faced powerhouse teams such as UCLA, USC and No. 21 Texas A&amp;M in their preseason.</p>\n<p>One of Cal Poly’s multiple offensive threats is 6’4” senior guard David Nwaba. Averaging 11.6 points per game in nonconference play, Nwaba has been one of the top two scorers for Cal Poly in each of his last three seasons. He is also the Mustangs’ leading rebounder with 5.6 boards per game, ranking fourth among Big West players.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Joel Awich also adds to the team’s offense with his presence down low as he entered the Mustangs’ last nonconference matchup against Texas A&amp;M on Tuesday, scoring a team best 11.7 points per game. In addition, he is ranked 12th among Big West players in rebounding with 5.4 per game.  Awich is also a solid defensive player and is currently Cal Poly’s third leading all-time shot blocker with a career total of 95.</p>\n<p>Altogether, Cal Poly averages 76.6 points per game, the second-highest in the conference. The Mustangs have already scored 80-plus points three times this season, a remarkable change from last year when they didn’t reach 80 points in any game. In the last nine years, this is only the second time they have averaged more than 70 points per game.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has committed the least amount of turnovers per game since the beginning of the 2012-13 season, averaging just 9.21 turnovers over 107 games. It will take an aggressive defensive effort to force the Mustangs into making offensive mistakes.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s next game will be its conference home opener versus UCSB on Jan. 14 for a Blue-Green rivalry game that will take place at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge- Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSU Northridge men’s basketball team enters the new year, coming off of a 5-9 preseason featuring some tough games against perennial giants USC and UCLA, the Matadors are aiming to compete with the top teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>They are led by former Sacramento Kings coach and two-time NBA All-Star Reggie Theus, who is entering his third season as the Northridge coach. He has led the squad to two Big West Tournament appearances, including a trip to the final in the 2013-14 season, and will be looking to do the same this year.</p>\n<p>“We obviously want to grow as a program and win as many games as possible,” Theus said. “We have a young team with six freshmen, so we’re developing our young players so the program will be strong for years to come.”</p>\n<p>The younger players will eventually have to fill the hole left by seniors Stephan Hicks and Stephen Maxwell. Last year, Hicks was named to the Big West All-Conference Second Team and finished his career at CSUN with 1,973 points, good for eighth on the conference’s all-time scoring charts. Maxwell was an honorable mention for the All-Conference team.</p>\n<p>Theus is sure his current roster can make up for the loss with a deep backcourt, featuring junior guard Aaron Parks, who is returning after a big end to last season, including a 21 point outburst in the first round of the Big West Tournament in the 71-67 loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“We have a really solid guard trio with [Parks, Kendall Smith, Michael Warren], and we’re expecting these guys to have great seasons for us,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>Smith and Parks are the two leading scorers for Northridge thus far this year, averaging 17.0 and 15.0 points per game, respectively. Smith also brought home the Big West Player of the Week in his first two games for the Matadors after taking a year off of basketball following his transfer from UNLV.</p>\n<p>With conference play starting up Jan. 6 against Long Beach, the Matador coaching staff is preparing its players to peak later in Big West play when the postseason approaches.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of things we need to fine-tune and tweak, but you need to be playing your best basketball in February,” Theus said. “Going into the end of the season we’ll be playing our best basketball. That’s the goal.”</p>\n<p>After an eighth place finish last year, with Smith and Parks being one of the stronger backcourts in the Big West, that can be enough to lead the Matador charge up the Big West standings.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis- Sinead Leon</strong></p>\n<p>After a historic 2014-2015 season, the reigning Big West Conference regular season champion UC Davis men’s basketball team is looking to repeat its success from last year.</p>\n<p>With a perfect 14-0 home record, the Aggies finished with the best record in conference play for the first time in school history. They also went on to claim the No. 2 spot for most overall victories in school history with 25 in total.</p>\n<p>However, this season has not looked too great so far for the Aggies, who are ranked second to last with a 5-8 overall record in non-conference games and tied to finish seventh according to this year’s preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the game is that things can turn around at any time, and what better time than a clean slate heading into Big West play.</p>\n<p>UC Davis will count on senior forward Josh Fox, a returning veteran from last year’s successful squad, to be a key asset not only with his play on the court, but also as a leader. Fox was named Big West Conference Sixth Man of the Year, along with All-Big West</p>\n<p>Honorable Mention. His preseason performance has only shown why he deserved such awards as he opened up the season with double-doubles against North Dakota State and has continued to lead the charts in several games.</p>\n<p>Other players to keep an eye out for are junior center Neal Monson and freshman Siler Schneider. Monson had nine rebounds in his first reserve appearance against Seattle, and with an average of 8.8, he is now ranked No. 2 in the Big West in rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>While Schneider has had three double-digit scoring games out of his last four appearances.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Jim Les has expressed how excited he is for the new players this season, as he considers it to be one of the most talented recruiting classes in years.</p>\n<p>Although they could be considered the underdogs looking at their record so far, the Aggies should not be underestimated as they have rebounded from being the last place team one season to being regular season champs the following year.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton- Xavier Cardenas </strong></p>\n<p>With preseason play now in the books, the Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team looks ahead to its conference season opener tonight against UC Riverside. With the help of key veteran guard play from redshirt junior Tre’ Coggins, the Titans hope to surpass their projected ninth place finish in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>This veteran roster brings in the fourth best overall record coming into conference play at 7-6 with key victories against University of Pacific, Nevada and Cal State East Bay.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Titans are shooting 42.3 percent from the field along with a 37.2 percent mark from outside the arc, good for ninth and third in the conference, respectively. They are also second in rebounds, averaging 38.3 rpg, and are 4th in ppg at 73.5. The efforts of a determined Fullerton team have been reflected in the production of Coggins. The junior is averaging 16.3 ppg shooting at a 40.8 percent clip while picking up 1.8 assists per game. However, his scoring ability has placed him as the fourth highest scorer in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Titans wrapped up the season at 9-22 overall, but finished just 1-15 in conference play. Yet, if the preseason progression of this mixture of young and experienced roster is any indication of what to expect, then Cal State Fullerton can have a good run in conference play, as it is currently outperforming other Big West teams statistically.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton travels to Riverside to tip off against the Highlanders tonight at 8 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*All statistics accurate as of 1/6/16</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9, 10, and 11 of January 7, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67220\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/2015-16-big-west-mens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67220\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/2015-16-big-west-mens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/2015-16-big-west-mens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/2015-16-big-west-mens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/2015-16-big-west-mens-basketball-conference-preview/","id":386,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[385,384,383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry to Start Big West Play for UCSB on Thursday, Continues with UCR on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The non-conference schedule is wrapped up and conference play has arrived!

Thursday’s conference opener couldn’t be any more enticing as the Blue-Green rivalry will be in full effect with the Gauchos hosting Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>They welcome the Mustangs, 7-6 overall, who have finished within the top three of the Big West standings for the past seven-straight seasons, but have not won the conference tournament championship since 2011.

The Highlanders are 7-7, but have a losing record on the road of 3-6. While Riverside last played on Saturday, both UCSB and Cal Poly should be well rested having not played in over a week.</p>\n<p>“It’s been nice to have this much practice time to clean up things,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Sometimes when you play so frequently and don’t get enough practice, you get game slippage. We’ve just got to work on us, honestly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the indefinite ineligibility of freshman forward Kali Jones, UCSB has been forced to play with a smaller lineup. However, in three games without Jones, the Gauchos have surpassed their season average of 35.9 rebounds per game with an average of 47.6. They are 2-1 and have outrebounded each of its opponents, recording consecutive season-highs of 49 versus La Verne and a season-best 58 versus Morehead St.</p>\n<p>While UCSB seems to have established its presence on the boards, it will be tested in the paint by Cal Poly’s junior forward Hannah Gilbert. Despite the graduation of former two-time All-Big West First Team selection, guard Ariana Elegado, Gilbert has embraced a bigger role as the Mustangs have become more active in getting the ball in the paint.</p>\n<p>Her 52.6 field goal percentage led the Big West last season and she currently leads the conference in rebounding with an average of 9.6 boards per game, ranking 35<sup>th</sup> in the nation in addition to being second on the team in scoring, averaging 12.2 ppg. Gilbert also is atop the conference in double-doubles with five on the season and recently earned Big West Player of the Week honors for achieving career-highs in points and rebounds with 23 and 17. Her career night helped Cal Poly break its single-game school record for rebounds with a total of 74, surpassing the former record of 67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s physicality and ability to consistently box out in the paint will be key in denying the Mustangs of having an advantage on the boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s matchup versus UC Riverside on Saturday will be the end of a four-game home stretch before heading back onto the road. Santa Barbara looks to end another losing streak this weekend as it has loss the last three meetings to Riverside.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent a fourth-straight loss, the Gauchos must contain UCR’s lethal scoring offense. The Highlanders lead the Big West in points per game (73.6), field goal percentage (43.6), assists per game (18.6- 11<sup>th</sup> nationally), free throw percentage (72.7), three-point percentage (35.1- 49<sup>th</sup> nationally) and commit the fewest turnovers with an average of 15.4 per game.</p>\n<p>In addition to its No. 11 national ranking in assists per game, Riverside ranks seventh in the country in total assists with 260 this season while ranking 23<sup>rd</sup> with a 1.21 assists turnover ratio.</p>\n<p>The share of wealth on offense lands three Highlanders — senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito as well as redshirt junior forward Réjane Verin— within the top five scorers of the Big West.</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that the reigning Big West Player of the Year in Crain is atop the conference in scoring (17.6 ppg)  after ranking 11<sup>th</sup> in the nation and first in the Big West in points per game last season with an average of 21.7. She also ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.6 percent.</p>\n<p>Ahead of Crain by a margin of .03 is UNLV transfer and former Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year, Verin, who’s 17.9 ppg leads the conference while she also ranks second in field goal percentage (49.5) and fourth in rebounds per game (7.9).</p>\n<p>In the team’s last game against Grand Canyon University, Crain and Verin both recorded double-double performances of 20 points and 10 rebounds, a milestone that hadn’t been achieved by a pair of UCR players since 2013.</p>\n<p>Completing the Highlanders trio of scoring alongside Crain in the backcourt is Ito. Her averages of 12.8 ppg and 7.1 rebounds per game ranks fifth in the Big West while she leads the team’s foundation of assists with an average of 4.9 per game which stands second in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCR is loaded on the offensive end, which will call for a big game from UCSB’s top scorers in sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Roper leads the Gauchos in scoring at an average of 12.1 ppg while Miller is second on the team at 9.2 ppg. Both are tied for the team lead in most games with double figures scored at seven while Roper has the edge of one game over Miller for most 20-point games at three.</p>\n<p>If Roper and Miller can manage to stay engaged and provide UCSB with scoring on offense throughout an entirety of four quarters, the Gauchos may be able to close out their conference opening weekend with a victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s conference opener will be Henrickson’s introduction to the Big West after spending just over a decade at the University of Kansas. Although the Big West isn’t one of the powerhouse conferences like the Big 12, Henrickson maintains the same mentality despite the change in conference.</p>\n<p>“I have great respect for the Big West,” she said. “You have quality coaches. I appreciate and respect teams that play the game it’s supposed to be played. This time of the year, you either get better or you get worse, nobody stays the same. It’d be a disservice and disrespectful if I coached them [UCSB] any differently.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest versus Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. while Saturday’s game on Jan. 9 versus UC Riverside will take place at 4:00 p.m. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67198\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67198\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/","id":382,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[381,380,379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn Second Consecutive Win in Final Non-Conf.

It earned a 76.7 free throw percentage versus Morehead State, scoring half of 8-2 run to open the game at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Her best performance since being placed within the Gauchos’ starting lineup, sophomore forward Chaya Durr scored a career-high 18 points while tallying six rebounds and a team-high two blocks. Both her and junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe shot 3-3 from the field in the first quarter. Jemerigbe ended the contest with 14 points.</p>\n<p>However, matching UCSB’s quick start was the Eagles’ sophomore forward Eriel McKee and freshman guard Miranda Crockett. Crocket scored a game-high 27 points and seven assists while McKee registered a double-double with 21 points and 11 rebounds. The two combined for 18 points in the first quarter on 50 percent shooting but could not prevent UCSB’s 26-21 lead at the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB achieve its 46.5 shooting percentage was its production off the bench as well. Senior guard Jasmine Ware and sophomore forward Taylor Farris provided 27 of the team’s 29 bench points.</p>\n<p>Farris notched a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, her second consecutive game with double-figure rebounds, while Ware scored 17 points on a 6-9 shooting effort. Helping the Gauchos maintain their narrow lead was senior forward Kendra Morrison who grabbed six rebounds in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>As both teams traded points throughout the quarter, it was UCSB’s success at the free throw line (8-10) that allowed it to have a 46-42 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ improved defense in the second half enabled their splurge of points in the second half as they took their first double-figure lead in 7:37 mark of the third quarter. As UCSB held Morehead St. to an overall field goal percentage of 38.5 percent, Ware’s 10 points in the third quarter extended UCSB’s lead to 72-59.</p>\n<p>Adding to the spectacular efforts of Crockett and McKee, redshirt junior guard Brianna McQueen scored 16 points, but was the only player besides the two that made an effective contribution to the Eagles’ attempt at a comeback.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos’ lead continued to expand as they recorded their best shooting percentage in the fourth quarter at 52.9 percent. UCSB earned its largest lead with 3:37 remaining in regulation at 85-64, leading it to its 93-78 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin its Big West Conference schedule in the New Year, hosting Cal Poly on Thursday, Jan. 7<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/","id":381,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[380,379,378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Eight Game Losing Skid with 89-41 Victory over La Verne","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-v-Santa-Clara-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-0870.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-v-Santa-Clara-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-0870.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team's total of 89 points in its win over La Verne on Sunday was its most in five years.

La Verne is now on a three-game losing streak, landing the Leopards with a 2-5 record.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, Santa Barbara outscored its opponent in each quarter of a game. The first quarter of Sunday’s game resulted in UCSB outscoring La Verne 18-8. It was the first start of the season for senior forward Kendra Morrison, who scored UCSB’s first two field goals of the game to ignite its 12-2 run.</p>\n<p>The emergence of Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper and senior guard Jasmine Ware helped UCSB build upon its lead in the second quarter. Miller and Roper provided two three-pointers each with Miller scoring eight and Roper six in the quarter while Ware scored eight points off the bench. Both Miller and Ware registered career-highs in assists as Miller finished with five and Ware had six, respectively.</p>\n<p>A make from beyond the arc by junior guard Faye Osburn brought La Verne within 10 points of the Gauchos’ lead of 27-17, causing a UCSB timeout. However, the scoring combination of Miller and Ware helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 43-22 at halftime as the two scored the team’s last 12 points to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Providing balance to the Gauchos’ tremendous offense was their stingy defense which held the Leopards to a 23.7 field goal percentage and 16.7 three-point percentage. UCSB held La Verne to just eight points in the paint. Sophomore forward Taylor Farris played a key role in the Gauchos’ denial of points down low. She tied her career-high of four blocks and recorded a career and game-high of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>It was a similar tale in the second half as the Gauchos opened the third quarter with a 6-0 run. Despite senior guard Shannon Irwin and junior forward Noelle Cobb scoring 13 points each, La Verne was unable to contain UCSB’s offensive attack. In addition to its control of the paint, Santa Barbara’s second unit was seemingly unstoppable outscoring the Leopards 42-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored La Verne 47-19 in the second half. As the fourth quarter ended, the Gauchos’ largest lead of 51 points helped them to cruise to their 89-41 victory.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game was the first of four-straight home games for UCSB. Santa Barbara will host Morehead State next Monday, Dec. 28<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/","id":376,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[375,374,373],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Poor Rebounding Lands UCSB With Pair of Losses in Trip to Louisiana","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.18.2014-6578.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.18.2014-6578.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Losses to Louisiana-Lafayette on Tuesday and LSU on Sunday extended the UCSB women's basketball team's slump to eight games.

Louisiana-Lafayette outrebounded UCSB 37-22.</p>\n<p>The abundance of turnovers led to no Gaucho player tallying double-figures in scoring. Santa Barbara never led in Tuesday’s game and its slew of seven turnovers in the first quarter spurred the Ragin’ Cajuns’ 12-0 run to take a 17-4 lead. Louisiana- Lafayette’s backcourt was active early as senior point guard Kia Wilridge totaled eight points in the quarter while junior guard Jaylyn Gordon scored six to help the team go up 20-10 heading into the second quarter. Wildridge finished with a game-high 14 points as Gordon was just one point shy of her teammate at 13.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained committed to scoring its points in the paint, helping it to achieve such a high field goal percentage. More than half of Santa Barbara’s points occurred from buckets down low as it scored 22 of its points in the paint. Leading UCSB in scoring was freshman guard Coco Miller with eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field, 2-5 from behind the three-point line. She also had a career-high five steals.</p>\n<p>However, the Ragin’ Cajuns held the Gauchos scoreless for nearly four minutes during the second quarter. A make at the free throw line by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe ended the Gauchos’ scoring drought but Louisiana-Lafayette still went into halftime with an 11-point lead of 30-19.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting continued in the second half, not making its first field goal until the 5:11 mark of the third quarter from a Miller jumpshot.</p>\n<p>Helping Louisiana-Lafayette expand its lead in the third quarter was the production of senior guard Keke Veal off the bench. She scored the team’s last six points to end the quarter, ending the game with 12 points on 6-16 shooting, four rebounds, and a team-high four steals to give La.-Lafayette a 42-30 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Veal’s 12 points was the primary source for Louisiana-Lafayette outscoring UCSB 22-10 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Scoring spurts throughout the final quarter helped UCSB to trim the Ragin’ Cajuns’ lead but was not enough as they gained their largest lead of 24 with 2:01 left in regulation. They outscored UCSB 23-12 over the final 12 minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing UCSB to record a 47.1 field goal percentage, Louisiana-Lafayette concluded Tuesday with a 44.6 field goal percentage on 22 more shot attempts than UCSB from the field to earn the 61-42 win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were outrebounded 29-43 against LSU, but it wasn’t just their lack of boards that resulted in their 68-50 victory over UCSB.</p>\n<p>A career night by senior forward Akilah Bethel guided the Tigers to victory. She scored a career-high 18 points in addition to nine rebounds and tied careers high in assists (5), steals (4) and made field goals (8) to earn Louisiana Sports Writers Association player of the week honors.</p>\n<p>Despite its field goal percentage of 34 percent to end the game, UCSB only trailed by two at 22-24 with 1:53 left in the first half. But, a jumpshot by Bethel sparked LSU’s 6-0 run to close the second quarter to take a 30-22 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring was senior guard Jasmine Ware as she finished with 10 points but certainly her performance alone was unsuitable to trim the Tigers’ lead to single-digits.</p>\n<p>The third quarter signaled the emergence of sophomore guard Jenna Deemer. She went scoreless in the second quarter after recording six points in the first but was 3-6 from three-point range on an overall 6-11 shooting effort to finish with 16 points, helping give LSU a 48-33 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 field goal percentage in the fourth was its best shooting performance of the afternoon. Yet, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the outstanding 66.7 field goal percentage that the Tigers obtained in the quarter to secure the 68-50 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last away non-conference game is a rematch at Santa Clara this Friday, Dec. 18<sup>th</sup> at 6:00 p.m. in Leavey Center.

After not being on the court since last Thursday, the Ragin’ Cajuns returned to the court on Saturday to earn an 84-36 win versus Dillard University.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB did not have one player average double-figure points per game last season. However, sophomore guard Makala Roper has emerged as the Gauchos’ top scorer this season, averaging 12.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>She has scored within double-figures in five of the team’s nine games, in which four of these scoring performances occurred while she was coming off the bench. Most notably, she scored a career-high 27 points against Pepperdine, prompting her addition to UCSB’s starting lineup. While the free throw line has been troubling for UCSB, Roper leads the Gauchos in free throws made with 31 and is just two three-pointers shy of the team-high of 15 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>LSU is undefeated in home games this season at 3-0. Due to unspecified disciplinary reason, the Tigers lost their leading scorer in former first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection guard Danielle Ballard.</p>\n<p>Still, the Tigers have managed to make up for Ballard’s averages of 14.5 ppg and 7.2 rebounds per game from last season. After starting in just one game and averaging 5.7 ppg last year, sophomore guard Jenna Deemer has embraced a larger role for this year’s LSU team.</p>\n<p>The New Orleans, Louisiana native leads the Tigers in scoring with an average of 11.3 points per game. Nonetheless, she has been LSU’s best deep range shooter. Deemer has made a team-high 20 three-pointers this season and is currently shooting a superb 42.6 percent from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Although junior guard Raigyne Moncrief and transfer forward Alexis Hyder average double-figures in scoring as well at 10 ppg each, it’s their rebounding abilities that makes them most effective on the court. Hyder leads the team in rebounds with 8.2 per game as Moncrief follows behind her at 7.0 per game.</p>\n<p>On average, Santa Barbara is outrebounded in the paint. UCSB averages 34.3 rebounds per game while its opponents have averaged 39.8 rebounds per game this season. Yet, if the Gauchos can be aggressive on the boards and find a way to limit LSU’s second chance points, it may increase their odds in Sunday’s bout.</p>\n<p>Finding a way to gameplan against the Ragin’ Cajuns’ arsenal of guards will be the most challenging aspect in Tuesday’s game for UCSB.  The Gauchos have a chance to end Louisiana-Lafayette’s winning streak in what will be the first meeting between the two programs ever.</p>\n<p>Louisiana-Lafayette has a veteran trio of guards in senior Keke Veal, senior Kia Wilridge and junior Jaylyn Gordon. Each player averages 14 points per game, providing different talents on the court. Wilridge is currently shooting an impressive 53.8 percent from the field while Gordon has been a sharpshooter from behind the three-point line with a 40.4 percentage.</p>\n<p>The Ragin’ Cajuns have held opponents to a measly 27 percent from behind the three-point line so far this season; however, the Gauchos’ ability to knock down their long distance shots may be the best chance they have to combat the level of scoring in Louisiana-Lafayette’s backcourt.</p>\n<p>Along with Roper, freshman shooting guard Coco Miller provides UCSB with the best three-point shooting ability. She holds the team-high of 15 three-pointers made this season and finished 5-10 from behind the perimeter in a 19-point performance versus Santa Clara last Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game against LSU will tip-off at 1:00 p.m. Pacific time while next Tuesday’s matchup on Dec. 15<sup>th</sup> against Louisiana-Lafayette will begin at 9:00 am Pacific time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/","id":368,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[367,366,365],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Half Meltdown Leads to UCSB’s 70-63 loss to LMU, Prepare for Three-Game Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WBasketball_CamerynBrock_for1162015-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WBasketball_CamerynBrock_for1162015-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a season-best 81.5 free throw percentage, the UCSB women's basketball team could not maintain its consistency in the second half in its 70-63 loss to Loyola Marymount on Friday.

There’s a tremendous amount of pride in that locker room, they want it.”</p>\n<p>Despite enduring another defeat, Friday marked the UCSB debut of Je Zhé Newton, a transfer from Central Arizona College. Now healthy after an injury that held her out for the first eight of the team’s nine games, Newton played just 17 minutes and finished with five points, six rebounds, one block and steal.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“She’s [Je Zhé] a kid who can handle people being physical with her and she can give it back,” Henrickson said. “It’s nice to give Kali a little break from that because she gets everybody’s biggest, strongest kid. To her credit she has paid attention while she’s been out. For a kid that can keep somebody behind her, we have to throw her the ball more and get her enough touches.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was a season-best performance for the Gauchos at the free throw line as they shot 22-27 from the stripe for an 81.5 percentage.</p>\n<p>After its sixth consecutive loss, Santa Barbara is now 1-8 overall. As for LMU, it was the Lions first win on the road as they improved to 3-5 on the season.</p>\n<p>Both teams had a total of three players score within double-figures, but it was UCSB’s 19 turnovers that aided the Lions’ second half improvements. After just seven turnovers in the first half, UCSB turned the ball over 12 more times while seven occurred in the third quarter alone. The Lions capitalized on the Gauchos’ mistakes, outscoring UCSB 28-10 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>LMU’s prowess on defense aided its 50 percent shooting performance in the second half, propelling the Lions in their win over UCSB. Despite being held under a field goal percentage of 30 percent in the first half at 28.1 percent, LMU emerged in the second half. Particularly, the Lions’ 21-10 outscoring of UCSB in the third quarter was their most pivotal stretch in their offensive resurgence.</p>\n<p>A 10-2 run early in the first quarter helped LMU earn a 12-6 lead. UCSB made 14-15 free throws in the first half and made four of its first six points at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, providing an offensive stimulus for UCSB was senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware. Prior to Tuesday’s game versus Santa Clara, Ware had been in the Gauchos’ starting lineup but came off the bench in their contest against the Broncos. She only played for 10 minutes and had zero points.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Ware played 27 minutes and was the primary catalyst for UCSB’s 27 bench points. She shot 6-13 from the field, 2-3 from long distance for 18 points and led UCSB in rebounds with seven, scoring 15 points in the first half. Her individual 8-0 scoring run in the first quarter gave UCSB a 14-12 lead as it extended its lead to end the quarter up by two, 18-16.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s consistency at the free throw line helped it maintain this lead. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr was efficient, scoring six of her 10 points on the night at the free throw line where she was a perfect 6-6.</p>\n<p>A layup by freshman forward Kali Jones gave UCSB it largest lead of five at 35-30 with 1:06 remaining in the first half. A late layup by LMU’s senior guard Sophie Taylor reduced the Gauchos’ lead to three as they went into halftime with a 35-32 lead.</p>\n<p>Guiding Loyola Marymount’s resurgence in the second half was senior guard Deanna Johnson. She scored 12 of her team-leading 17 points in the half and finished with a 5-8 shooting night and was 6-6 at the free throw line. Johnson’s jump shot was the Lions’ first field goal in the third quarter, sparking their 7-0 run to take a 39-36 lead.</p>\n<p>However, matching Johnson’s performance was sophomore guard Makala Roper. She scored 16 of her 18 points in the second half as back-to-back three-pointers by her and Ware created the Gauchos’ 7-2 run and regained their lead at 44-41.</p>\n<p>In spite of this scoring run, Santa Barbara shot 8-27 in the second half for a 29.6 field goal percentage after a 41.7 percentage in the first half. The Gauchos were held scoreless in the last 2:11 of the third quarter while LMU erupted for a 10-0 run and earned its largest lead of 53-45 to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB managed to trim this deficit behind an 11-point performance by Roper in the fourth quarter. She scored four of the team’s six points to begin the quarter, a 6-0 run that brought UCSB within two 51-53.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed their stoutness on defense, holding LMU scoreless for nearly half the fourth quarter. It wasn’t until the 6:18 mark that the Lions scored their first field goal but it was the beginning of a 6-2 run that gave them a 59-53 lead, causing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>After 19 points on Tuesday, freshman guard Coco Miller couldn’t follow up her play with six points and four turnovers on 2-11, 1-8 shooting from beyond the arc on Friday. However, her one three-point field goal came at the most crucial time as she drained the long-range shot with 1:04 remaining in regulation to bring UCSB within a three-point deficit of 61-64.</p>\n<p>LMU’s 6-2 run in the game’s last minute secured its 70-63 win as the Gauchos looked stagnant on offense and allowed a go-ahead coast to coast layup off an inbound to end the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road for its next three games, spending the majority of its time in Louisiana facing LSU on Sunday, Dec. 13<sup>th</sup> at 1:00 p.m. in the Maravich Center and Louisiana-Lafayette on Tuesday, Dec. 15<sup>th</sup> at 9:00 a.m. in the Earl K. Long Gymnasium. The Gauchos will have a chance to redeem Tuesday’s loss to Santa Clara in a rematch on Friday, Dec. 18<sup>th</sup> at 6:00 p.m. in the Leavey Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66958\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66958\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/","id":373,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[372,371,370],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Fifth-Striaght vs. Broncos, Host LMU on Friday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_4-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_4-web1.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"It was a poor shooting night for the UCSB women's basketball team, shooting 13-47 from the field in its 48-37 loss versus Santa Clara on Tuesday night.

She ended the game 1-10 shooting, 1-6 from behind the perimeter and made just one of four free throw attempts.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think she was shot-ready today,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “A good shooter has to have a short-term memory.

After beginning its season 0-2, Santa Clara is now 5-2 after earning its fifth-straight victory.</p>\n<p>Despite its shots not falling, Santa Barbara did manage to stay in the game in the first quarter, making 2-5 three-point attempts. Scoring one of the team’s field goals was freshman forward Kali Jones with a layup. Yet she would be sent to the bench due to picking up two early fouls and did not play for the rest of the first half.</p>\n<p>A UCSB turnover in the last 20 seconds of the first quarter resulted in a buzzer layup by sophomore guard Taylor Berry to give the Broncos an 11-9 lead to close the quarter. They capitalized on the quick lead, turning the score into a 6-0 run to open the second quarter.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 5:50 mark that UCSB earned its first field goal of the quarter from a layup by sophomore forward Chaya Durr. Limiting UCSB’s attempt to feed the paint was the Broncos’ 2-3 zone. For the first time this season, the Gauchos were outscored in the paint 14-28.</p>\n<p>Leading the Broncos’ frontcourt was sophomore forward Morgan McGwire as she led Santa Clara with 13 points on 6-10 shooting and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara also used a 2-2-1 full court press throughout the game in combination with its zone. UCSB was unable to overcome the pressures of the defensive traps and double teams of Santa Clara’s on-ball defense, turning the ball over 17 times in the first half and ending with a total of 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It [2-2-1 zone] was aggressive, it came to a double right away,” Henrickson said. “We have to have cutters coming to the ball. Everybody has to be more aggressive, not just the ballhander.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara turned the ball over a total of 29 times, but the Gauchos were unable to benefit from the Broncos’ mistakes, scoring just 13 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You have to score,” Henrickson said. “We missed opportunities at the rim. You have to be able to knock down free throws, the free throw line has been an issue for us all year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its night with a 33.3 free throw percentage, making 5-15 attempts.<br>\nDespite their turnovers, the Broncos managed to increase their lead to a margin of eight at 19-11 with nearly two minutes remaining in the first half. However, a strong first half performance by freshman shooting guard Coco Miller kept the Gauchos’ deficit from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>After two quarters, Miller was 3-4 shooting the ball in which all of her field goal makes and attempts were from long range. Her two three-pointers as the second quarter ended helped trim the Broncos’ lead to 17-21 at halftime. Adding to Miller’s nine points was a free throw make to give her a game-high 10 points in the first half. She finished the game with a game-high 19 points, finishing 5-10 from three-point distance.</p>\n<p>Before recording her third personal foul with 2:54 on the clock in the third quarter, Jones’ return uplifted UCSB’s presence in the paint. Santa Barbara scored eight of its 11 points down low but could not stop the Broncos’ response as they maintained a 27-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Pulling the Gauchos within a one-point deficit was Miller’s basket beyond the arc, cutting Santa Clara’s lead to 26-27. The Broncos entered the fourth quarter with a 30-28 lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara trailed in the beginning of the first quarter, but never lost its advantage once it took a 5-3 lead in Tuesday’s contest. A 13-3 scoring run gave the Broncos their largest lead of 12 at 43-31 with 3:45 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points was Miller with a three-pointer and three makes at the free throw line. Still, her lone performance was not enough to surpass the Broncos’ defense, which held the Gauchos scoreless for the last two minutes of regulation to earn the 48-37 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB was outrebounded 31-45 on Tuesday night, leading to its being outscored in second chance points 7-24.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain in Santa Barbara for another home game versus Loyola Marymount this Friday, Dec. 4 at 7:00 p.m. The Lions are 2-5 overall and are winless on the road with a 0-3 record in away games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/","id":372,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[371,370,369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take On USC in 2015 Home Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB got its offense going last week, but can the Gauchos keep it up hosting a Trojan team off to a hot 5-2 start?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in just its second home game of the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team welcomes the USC Trojans to the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66880\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1912400557\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66849\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66880\" data-attachment-id=\"66880\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/maxwell-kupchak-reaches-for-a-rebound-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Maxwell Kupchak reaches for a rebound.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos went 1-1 on the road last week and are coming off Sunday’s tough 70-68 loss on a last-second, game-winning putback by Arizona St.’s senior forward Eric Jacobsen. They enter tonight’s matchup with a record of 2-3.</p>\n<p>Although expectations weren’t exactly sky-high for USC coming into the year, a big 72-69 upset road win over then No. 20 Wichita St. one week ago capped a surprising 5-0 perfect start to the season. The Trojans have since dropped their last two games on the road to No. 12 Xavier and Monmouth and come to Santa Barbara at 5-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Inconsistent shooting had been the story for the Gauchos to start the season, but they appeared to find some answers on the offensive end in their last two outings, particularly from their starting guards in junior Eric Childress and sophomore Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Against Arizona St. on Sunday, Childress put up an all-around stat line characteristic of his ability to do all the little things, recording nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Vincent, who had been particularly struggling with his shot through the first three games of the year, went 12-25 from the field and 6-13 from deep over the past two games. He is averaging 10.8 points and 1.4 steals per game, good for third and second best on the team, respectively.</p>\n<p>Two players who have most certainly not hurt UCSB’s shooting percentage are seniors Michael Bryson and Sam Beeler. Since missing the first game of the season due to suspension, Bryson has stepped easily into his role as the team’s best offensive player, shooting a team-best 37.5 percent from three and 48.2 percent from the field. His 18.8 points per game average ranks second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beeler, who has started all five games at center, has shot an extremely efficient 76 percent from the field, finding most of his shots deep in the paint for an average of 7.6 points a night.</p>\n<p>The Trojans’ 5-0 start to this season was their best start since going 8-0 in 2000-01. They are led on the offensive side by former Etiwanda High School standout guard Jordan McLaughlin. The sophomore, who was voted one of the team’s two captains for the 2015-16 season, was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team last season with averages of 12.1 points, three rebounds and 4.5 assists. He has been especially hot to open this season, leading the team with 15.3 points per contest and shooting 55.2 percent overall and 51.9 percent on threes.</p>\n<p>Backing him up are junior guard Julian Jacobs and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, who come in averaging 12.4 points each. In just his freshman year, Boatwright has impressed with an ability to score from inside and out, tying McLaughlin for the team lead in three-pointers made with two per game.</p>\n<p>Jacobs has shown that he can do much more than just score, sitting at second on the team with averages of 6.3 rebounds and 1.28 steals and leading the way with 5.5 assists.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be the Gauchos’ last home game of 2015 before playing their next six on the road. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/","id":342,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[341,340,339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Foul Troubles End with Losses at Pepperdine and Wyoming, Host Santa Clara on Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 59 personal fouls and its inability to make free throws landed the UCSB women's basketball team with losses to Pepperdine and Wyoming over the weekend.

They combined for 46 points on 18-35 shooting and made 9-15 attempts at the free throw line. Green led the team with 24 points and was 5-5 at the line while Ogwumike scored 22 points and was 4-10 shooting free throws.</p>\n<p>Compared to Pepperdine’s field goal percentage of 35 percent and its three-point percentage of 20 percent, UCSB had a stronger performance shooting, 41.4 percent from the field and meagerly were better from three with a 28.6 percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the Waves’ 71.1 free throw percentage was better than Santa Barbara’s 55.6 percentage and proved to be the deciding factor in Sunday’s game.</p>\n<p>Leading the Waves’ 11-2 run to begin the game was Ogwumike with seven points. Despite allowing the scoring run, a make from beyond the arc by Roper sparked UCSB’s 11-0 run to take a 13-11 lead, forced a Pepperdine timeout and eventually ended with a 15-15 tie to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ 28-27 lead with 2:35 left in the second quarter would be their last of the game. But jumpshots by Jones and sophomore forward Chaya Durr resulted in UCSB trailing 32-33 at the end of the first half. Durr registered a game-high 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s 10-point, 48-38 lead was its largest of the game at the 3:21 mark of the third quarter.  Contributing to the lead was the duo of Green and Ogwumike, scoring 17 points. The Waves’ lead lasted until the 1:43 mark of the quarter but was trimmed to 48-54 by UCSB’s 6-1 run to end the third.</p>\n<p>Two layups by Jones for UCSB, a layup by Ogwumike and a free throw for Pepperdine were scored to start the fourth quarter prior to neither team scoring for nearly the next two minutes.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Pepperdine found itself in foul trouble as well, committing a total of 28 fouls. But, ending the game’s scoreless streak was Roper, making a pair of free throws. Her ability to make free throws was most crucial in the fourth quarter as she made 10-11 and scored 14 points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A missed layup by Pepperdine freshman guard Kayla Blair led to senior Dioseline Lopez scoring a layup to bring the Gauchos within two at 69-71. This prompted Santa Barbara’s plan to intentionally foul which landed Ogwumike at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Ogwumike missed both free throw attempts while Jones grabbed the rebound for UCSB and led to the Gauchos calling a timeout with five seconds remaining in regulation. With little time remaining, Lopez attempted a game-winning three-pointer but came up short as UCSB loss 69-71.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has struggled to consistently knock down free throws in each game so far this season. Its 53.3 free throw percentage on Friday certainly was an influence in its loss.</p>\n<p>Season-highs in scoring, field goal and three-point percentage still weren’t enough in UCSB’s contest against Wyoming on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 50 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from behind the three-point line to score 67 points, but a series of scoring runs in the second half and their ability to make free throws helped the Cowgirls defeat UCSB 76-67. Wyoming made 27-35 free throws for a 77.1 percentage.</p>\n<p>It was a career night for freshman shooting guard Coco Miller, recording career-highs with 24 points, four steals, and two blocks.</p>\n<p>A total of four Wyoming players scored 12 or more points on Friday. The Cowgirls established their offensive dominance early, opening the first quarter with a 10-2 run. Wyoming outscored UCSB 19-8 to finish the quarter. Combining for 12 of the team’s points were senior guard Marquelle Dent and freshman forward Marta Gomez. They ended the first with six points apiece as Dent shot 3-3 and Gomez went 2-3 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Dent led Wyoming in points with 17 and had a game-high six assists while Gomez was just one-point behind her lead with 16.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara a just three fouls in the first quarter but would commit many more through the second quarter and beyond, allowing Wyoming to build upon its lead at the free throw line. Wyoming’ largest lead of 15 points appeared in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 9-0 run of its own to trim the Cowgirls’ lead to 21-27. Scoring Santa Barbara’s last five points to close the quarter was Miller as the Gauchos trailed 28-34 to head into halftime. Her performance in the second quarter was most pivotal as she scored 10 of her 24 points.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to bring Wyoming’s lead within a single figure deficit, the emergence of senior guard Jordan Kelley to start the second half increased the Cowgirls’ lead back to double digits. She scored Wyoming’s first seven points to begin the third quarter to extend their lead to 41-31. Kelley concluded the game with 13 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB to counter Wyoming’s scoring was its bench, outscoring the Cowgirls 26-9. Providing a career-high 11 points off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris to go along with a team-high five rebounds.</p>\n<p>An 8-0 run to close out the third quarter helped UCSB reduce Wyoming’s lead as a three-point basket by Miller brought Santa Barbara within four at 51-55. But the Gauchos found themselves down by double-figures at the start of the fourth quarter as Wyoming went on a 7-0 run to take a 62-51 lead with 8:17 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB’s 11 steals was its second-highest this season, Wyoming‘s 14 free throw attempts in the fourth quarter was its most throughout the entirety of the game and ultimately led the Cowgirls to their 76-67 win over UCSB. Dent shot all nine of her free throw attempts in the quarter, making seven and scoring nine points in the fourth. Nearly perfect from the line was sophomore guard Liv Roberts, finishing 8-9 at the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the month of December hosting Santa Clara this Tuesday in the Thunderdome at 7:00 p.m. Currently on a four-game winning streak, the Broncos are 4-2 overall and beat UCSB 47-33 in last season’s matchup in Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/","id":407,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[406,405,404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer 62-60 loss to UTGRV on Game-Winning Layup, Prepare for  Wyoming and Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a 21-point effort by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper and a game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison, the UCSB women's basketball allowed UTRGV to score a game-winning layup for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison with seven seconds remaining in regulation knotted the UCSB women’s basketball team with the University of Texas- Rio Grande Valley at 60 apiece.

Protect the rim, make that kid make a pass at least. But we don’t lose it there. We lose it in all those stretches, we just kind of fall asleep and don’t attack. We didn’t rotate and protect the rim, it shouldn’t have never been.”</p>\n<p>Despite allowing an 11-0 run to open the third quarter and trailing 36-45 entering the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara nearly forced overtime in its comeback effort. Twenty-one points off the bench by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper guided the team’s come-from-behind attempt. Her 21 points were a game-high in Thursday’s contest and were two points shy of her career-high of 23.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Savoy’s late basket handed the Gauchos their second consecutive loss, making them 1-4 overall while it boosted UTRGV’s overall record to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Although junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore forward Chaya Durr were added to the team’s starting lineup for Thursday’s matchup, leading UCSB’s 8-1 run to start the game was senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware.</p>\n<p>In just five minutes of play, she scored six points on 3-4 shooting. The Gauchos’ success on offense eventually led to the Vaqueros playing a “one-man” full court press. This caused some problems for UCSB when inbounding the ball but was not the primary challenge in facing Rio Grande Valley.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t a full-court pressure,” Henrickson said. “The inbounder has to just let it go. You’re just letting one guy dictate the flow of the game. We looked better in the second half but we struggled in the first half with it. Not that we turned it over, but we didn’t get much flow and rhythm.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had a season-low 12 turnovers, but even more problematic was the Gauchos’ foul trouble. Freshman forward Kali Jones fouled out in the fourth quarter with 4:09 remaining in the game in addition to a total of five UCSB players had two or more fouls.</p>\n<p>UTRGV capitalized on UCSB’s abundance of fouls, going on a 10-0 run to take an 11-8 lead to end the first quarter. Prior to fouling out, Jones started to establish her presence in the paint in the second quarter. She scored four of her six points in the quarter and finished the game 3-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Jones’ minimal production in the game helped jumpstart the Gauchos outscoring the Vaqueros 34-18 in the paint as Durr, Roper, Ware and Morrison carried the workload down low while Jones played just 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 37.5 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages, Santa Barbara’s consistent drive to the paint helped it go into halftime with a three-point lead of 30-27.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s foul trouble proved to be costly in the third quarter. Having to send Jones, Ware and Jemerigbe to the bench nearly two minutes into the quarter, the Gauchos’ reserves were fatigued and it was evident as the Vaqueros outscored UCSB 18-6.</p>\n<p>Scoring eight points in UTRGV’s 11-0 run was junior guard Shawnte’ Goff. Despite an off first half in which she had four points all at the free throw line, she finished the game with 15 points on 4-10 shooting, 2-3 from long range and recorded three steals.</p>\n<p>“We had some momentum going into the locker room but came out flat,” Henrickson said. “We made some energy plays but that wasn’t until the last four minutes. It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play but how you play.”</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB’s bench outscored UTRVG’s 37-10, scoring 31 of these points were Roper and Morrison. In the last 3:26 of the quarter, the two scored the team’s last 11 points.</p>\n<p>Roper scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the fourth quarter, cutting the Vaqueros’ lead to five at 42-47. After playing just five minutes in the first half, Morrison went 4-7 from the field and had seven of her 10 points in the fourth quarter. She was also responsible for Santa Barbara’s last five points in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite Morrison’s game-tying layup, UCSB did not get back on defense quick enough and was beat by Savoy going coast to coast for the game-winning layup.</p>\n<p>In the 3:40 mark of the third quarter, Durr suffered an undisclosed injury while committing a foul.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Friday, Nov. 25<sup>th</sup> at Wyoming at 6:00 p.m. in Arena-Auditorium.

Despite only playing one game at home thus far, the Dons have gotten off to an impressive 3-1 start to the season.</p>\n<p>Establishing a flow on the offensive end will be one of the keys for the Gauchos at this early point in the season as they look to replace their offensive focal point from the last three seasons in Alan Williams. While they went 5-2 without Big Al last year, they haven’t found as much success this season, already matching their loss total in games without him and shooting just 36.2 percent overall and 23.4 from three-point range as a team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The starting backcourt of reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent and Eric Childress have struggled, with 25.8 and 31.3 percent marks overall, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson is the team’s top scorer, averaging 18.5 points a game. He has spent nearly every minute on the court after missing the first game due to suspension, leading the way at 38 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Senior forward John Green has stepped nicely into his role as the No. 2 offensive option, being the only Gaucho to record double-digit scoring numbers through the first three games and averaging 16.7 per contest. He has been UCSB’s best rebounder, averaging 7.7 a game, two more than starting center Sam Beeler.</p>\n<p>Beeler is coming off an impressive game against Oregon State in which he recorded the first double-double of his career. It will be very beneficial to the guard-heavy Gauchos if they can establish Beeler as an inside presence. While the team has struggled with shooting efficiency, the 6’10” senior has gone 9-12 over the last two games.</p>\n<p>San Francisco has already notched a couple of close wins this season, most recently a 58-57 victory over UC Riverside on Saturday on a game-winning layup by senior guard Tim Derksen with two seconds left.</p>\n<p>The Dons are led by Devin Watson, who scored a career-high 27 points in the win over the Highlanders. His 19.5 points per game is tops on the team, but he has been able to put up big numbers thanks to his average of over six free throw makes per game.</p>\n<p>After putting up 11 points and 13 boards on Saturday, Derksen has two double-doubles through four games. He is the team’s second leading scorer at 12.5 points and 8.5 rebounds a night.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Chase Foster has been knocking down the long ball this season, shooting 47.4 percent from three to give him 8.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to end their two-game skid tonight at 7:30 at the Sobrato Center in San Francisco.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66809\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66809\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/gauchos-look-to-end-two-game-skid-at-san-francisco/","id":404,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[403,402,401],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":23,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
