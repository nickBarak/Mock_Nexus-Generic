Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A new era is set to begin for the UCSB women’s basketball team with newly instated Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson taking the reins heading into the 2015-16 season. Joining her will be two incoming freshmen, guard Caroline “Coco” Miller from JSerra Catholic High School and power forward Kali Jones from Vista Murrieta High, as well as a completely revamped assistant coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“The players have worked hard in workouts and have been welcoming as far as relationship building, and all of us have appreciated that,” Henrickson said. “Really excited about [the new staff] as well, the people that we’ve been able to bring here, their skill set and their energy.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson was announced as the team’s new head coach less than a month ago, replacing Carlene Mitchell after a four-year stint in which the Gauchos went 43-82 overall. After winning the Big West Championship back in 2011 and earning a spot in the NCAA Tournament in Mitchell’s first season with UCSB, the Gauchos’ record worsened each year. They most recently finished in last place in the conference with a mark of 2-27 overall, leading to the change which brought Henrickson to the team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The last thing I want them doing is thinking about December and January and February,” Henrickson said. “I think right now they need to focus on being better on the 21st of May than they were yesterday. As soon as you start looking ahead it can be overwhelming. We’ve just got to saw the wood, grind it out every day and try to get a little better.”</p>\n<p>Aiding Henrickson in bringing UCSB back to the top of the Big West will be the team’s only two additions on the court for next year in Miller and Jones.</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’10”, Coco Miller will be a player that UCSB can look to offensively to help improve the team’s poor shooting percentages from last year. In her junior year at JSerra Catholic, Miller averaged a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds per game, resulting in her being named First Team All-State and First Team All-CIF. By the end of just her junior year, she had already become the school’s all-time leading scorer with 1871 points.</p>\n<p>“There’s a need for us to be able to shoot the ball better from three,” Henrickson said. “That’s exactly what she does. The kid can shoot it. Tough kid, high basketball IQ and good energy.”</p>\n<p>Helping to fill the void left by graduated senior Clair Watkins on the inside will be Kali Jones. The 6’1” power forward is a versatile weapon in the paint who averaged 16.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and nearly three blocks per game in her junior year at Chaparral High. Jones transferred to Vista Murrieta High for her senior year with the hopes of improving her game further against a higher level of competition.</p>\n<p>“She’s played some really talented kids, that’s what she was looking for. I admire those reasons that she wanted to play there,” Henrickson said. “She’s long, she’s got some size, which we need. She’s a really driven, motivated kid.”</p>\n<p>Every player on the team this past season, excluding graduated seniors Clair Watkins and Kristine Brance, is set to return to the roster in the fall. With new leadership and a fresh start, UCSB will be taking a step-by-step approach as it looks to improve heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>“When you just talk about winning, there’s a lot of things you’re not having conversations about. It’s all about a process. The win is the result,” Henrickson said. “If you’re result-focused, you’re probably going to screw up the process. We will coach these young ladies up and help them get better every day.”<br>\nThe Gauchos will play their first game under Henrickson in early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/","id":413,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[412,411,410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Golden State Looking Good in the Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Staff writer Edward Moss takes us through the Warriors current state after the first round","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62903\" style=\"width: 1270px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20141203__warriorsthompson1_500.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516579328\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62903\" data-attachment-id=\"62903\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/orlando-magic-at-golden-state-warriors-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20141203__warriorsthompson1_500.jpg?fit=500%2C290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"ARIC CRABB\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X\",\"caption\":\"Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) celebrates his game winning basket against the Orlando Magic during their game on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2014 in Oakland, Calif.

Thompson and Curry took over in the second half, with the Splash Brothers amounting for 48 points total.</p>\n<p>Game three saw the Warriors go down big again, this time needing a twenty-point comeback in the fourth quarter. Curry scored 40 points in the game including a ridiculous three-pointer in the final seconds of the game where he got trampled by two Pelicans’ defenders after he fired the shot. No foul was called on the play and the game went into overtime. The Warriors took control in the extra period and went on to win 124-119.</p>\n<p><b>The Splash Brothers are awesome, but don’t forget about Draymond Green</b></p>\n<p>MVP candidate Curry had a fantastic first-round series, averaging 33.7 points per game and Thompson was right behind him with 25 points per game. Both played huge roles and were able to take turns putting the team on their shoulders with the score close and the game on the line.</p>\n<p>With these two players sharing the limelight, it’s easy to look past how big of a role Green had in the series. Averaging 12.8 rebounds per game and 2.5 steals per game, Green played a tremendous role on the defensive front. He also added 15.8 points per game, showing off his size and strength at both ends of the floor. Expect Green to play a large role in the next round as he will be asked to defend the opposing team’s top player, as he did against New Orleans’ Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p><b>Game Plan For Next Series: Keep doing what’s been working</b></p>\n<p>The Warriors will be hunted by whichever team they end up playing. It’s their job to stick to their game plan from the rest of the season. If the Warriors pass and shoot the way they have been doing it all year, I can’t imagine any team being able to beat Golden State in the second round. The Warriors will be well rested and they will have veteran forward David Lee back from a lower back injury.</p>\n<p>Expect a lot of three-balls and for the Warriors to let Curry lead the way. He can dominate any team in the league with his shooting and when doubled teamed he always has an eye for an open teammate.</p>\n<p><b>Most likely second round opponent: San Antonio Spurs</b></p>\n<p>I expect the Warriors’ opponent to be the San Antonio Spurs, and Golden State will have to hope that their series with the Los Angeles Clippers goes the full seven games in order to make the winning team as tired as possible. While they have the advantage in experience, the Spurs are not as talented as they have been in past years and they aren’t getting any younger. The Warriors are too good to lose in the second round, but expect the series to be much more of a challenge than the first one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/","id":412,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[411,410,409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Close Season Out With Pair of Losses","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB finishes the year out with two losses as it fails to qualify for the Big West Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61751\" style=\"width: 341px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-12-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028905843\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61762\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61751\" data-attachment-id=\"61751\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/kristine-brance-soars-past-a-rainbow-warrior-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-12-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"Stephen Manga\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Kristine Brance soars past a Rainbow Warrior.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team had a rough year to say the least, but coming down to its final two games, it still had a slim chance to qualify for the Big West Tournament. That chance was taken away after a 60-36 loss to Hawaii on Thursday. The Gauchos then closed their 2014-15 campaign out with an 84-63 loss at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends the year with a 2-27 overall, 2-14 Big West record. Hawaii finished the season winning its final 14 games to claim the Big West title with a record of 22-7 overall and 14-2 in conference play. The Mustangs were able to claim a third place finish after their win over the Gauchos, ending the regular season with a 15-13 overall and 10-6 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB entered its final game against Cal Poly knowing that it would only be for pride, the Gauchos played some of their most inspired basketball in the first half. Senior guard Kristine Brance, playing her final game in a UCSB uniform, got things started with a three-pointer on the team’s first possession, setting the tone for what would be a high scoring first stanza.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, the Gauchos shot an impressive 15-25 from the field in the first half for a season-high 41 points. They were able to do this behind their long-range shooting, where they went 7-9 from beyond the arc. Junior guard Dioseline Lopez was hot early, going a perfect 3-3 from distance, while freshman guard Makala Roper went 2-3 herself. Despite the hot shooting though, UCSB still found itself down 48-41 at the half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Ariana Elegado answered UCSB at every turn, putting up 19 points of her own on 5-6 on three-pointers in the first half to go along with five assists. The senior guard went on to finish with 24 points on 8-14 from the field.</p>\n<p>Bench production was the theme for the Gauchos on the day, as all three of their double-digit scorers were not starters. Lopez and Roper ended the game with 13 and 11, respectively, while forward Chaya Durr knocked down an efficient 5-6 from the field herself, finishing her freshman campaign with a solid 11 point outing.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they could not maintain their hot shooting in the second half, going just 8-24 from the field and being outscored 36-22. Once again, a huge difference on the glass which saw UCSB get outrebounded 47-22 for the game proved to be the difference.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Taryn Garza recorded 12 rebounds and was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 11 points, giving her the game’s only double-double. UCSB’s sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe facilitated the offense throughout the game, finishing with a personal-best nine assists. She had seven in the first half alone.</p>\n<p>In Thursday’s game against Hawaii, UCSB needed a win to keep its slim hopes of postseason play alive. The Gauchos got off to a hot start as a layup by Brance gave them a 20-16 lead with 10:40 remaining in the first half. However, the Rainbow Wahine answered back with a 14-0 run, eventually taking a 30-23 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>A pair of free throws from freshman small forward Taylor Farris capped an 8-0 run by UCSB, pulling her team within a bucket at 30-28, but once again, Hawaii pulled away, going on yet another 14-0 run. The Gauchos managed just 13 points in the second half on 5-23 shooting as they fell 60-36.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe paced her team with another solid offensive performance, going for a game-high 14 points on 5-6 from the field and 2-2 on threes. Hawaii saw only one player scorer in double-figures, but shot a proficient 47.1 percent from the field as a team. Junior guard Destiny King led the way with team-highs of 11 points and nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Seniors in center Clair Watkins and Kristine Brance played their final college games this past weekend, leaving a young UCSB team that will looking to bounce back after a disappointing season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61762\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61762\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/","id":421,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[420,419,418],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Last Test: Beat Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MBasketball_vsUCI-20150228-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MBasketball_vsUCI-20150228-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Big Al and Zalmico Harmon will play in their final game at the Thunderdome against rival Cal Poly.

With the Big West Tournament held next week, the Gauchos are on a four-game winning streak, their longest of the season.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Poly sports a 6-9 conference record and is one game below .500 overall at 13-14.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For UCSB and Cal Poly, the game is where the teams’ season comes full circle. Back in January, Cal Poly hosted the Gauchos for each team’s respective Big West opener. It was a contest Cal Poly would like to have back. Down by 10 points with seven minutes left in the second half, the Gauchos went on a 20-5 run to close out the game, escaping with a 50-45 win.</p>\n<p>The same style of play seen in the previous encounter should also be on display Saturday considering Cal Poly is a team that forces opponents to slow down the tempo and play grind-it-out basketball. This season, the Mustangs have held the opposition to a season-low 59.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>It has also been nearly a year since Cal Poly upset the Gauchos in last season’s conference tournament as a No. 7 seed en route to its Cinderella appearance in the NCAA Tournament. For UCSB, it is another chance to exorcise those demons.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s contest against the Rainbow Warriors, Santa Barbara scored a season-high 98 points. Five different players scored in double-figures for the team with freshman guard Gabe Vincent leading the pack with a career-high 25 points on 8-13 shooting from the field. In total, 10 different players on the team scored and UCSB finished with a 56.4 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Senior center Alan “Big Al” Williams recorded his fourth double-double in five games since coming back from an injured shoulder. Big Al will once again be leaned on against Cal Poly to secure the paint and hunt down rebounds for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s offense does not focus on one single player like how Santa Barbara’s scoring centers around Big Al. The Mustangs’ leading scorer is junior guard/forward David Nwaba, who averages 11.9 points this season. Although his point total ranks only 14th in the league, he presents matchup problems because of his speed and athleticism.</p>\n<p>Both Big Al and senior guard Zalmico Harmon will be honored prior to the match for their last home game at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday’s game is set for 3 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 1  of March 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Mark Salay is the sports editor for the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s.

They have held their opponents under 60 points in each of their last three games, something they only accomplished four times in their previous 24 outings.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Jasmine Ware has taken over as UCSB’s top offensive player, scoring in double digits in three of her last four games. At 9.9 points per game during Big West play, she leads the way for her team which ranks last in the conference in a number of offensive categories, including points, field goal percentage and assists.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will face a Hawaii team which has been nearly unstoppable in the New Year. After dropping their first two conference games, the Rainbow Wahine have won 12 straight to take their place at the top of the conference.</p>\n<p>Hawaii ranks second in the Big West in points, averaging 68.5 a game. The Rainbow Wahine do much of their damage at the free throw line, where they rank first in makes and attempts. This could be a problem for a Gaucho team which has consistently been outshot at the line, as they enter in last place in both categories.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine are first in the Big West in blocks with 3.6 per game, led by senior guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu with an average of 1.3. Kuehu is also her team’s leading scorer, coming in averaging 12.4 points a game on an efficient 49.8 percent shooting, good for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB will close out the regular season against rival Cal Poly. The Mustangs will have a huge advantage in rebounding, coming in at second in the Big West averaging 42.2 a game. Rebounding has been a point of emphasis for the Gauchos as they have only outrebounded their opponents three times this season in 27 tries.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Vincent will need to get better when — not if — he becomes the best player on the team in the years to come. He’s only a few months removed from his senior year of high school, yet he plays like a senior with plenty of poise. He’s had to: to handle the pressure of making a game-winning shot, to have made his collegiate debut on the road against college basketball powerhouse Kansas, to start right away at the off-guard position on a team loaded with veterans.</p>\n<p>The youngest of three siblings, he grew up with parents that sometimes brought their work back home. Both his parents are psychologists, an experience Vincent described as “different”.</p>\n<p>“They’re in my head constantly without me even knowing it,” Vincent said. “… They know the answer before I can even answer it most of the times.”</p>\n<p>His parents had the right read on their son’s talent for basketball as well. Since he was in the sixth grade, Vincent began playing AAU ball, travelling to play in competitions.</p>\n<p>He split time playing for St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif. and the Oakland Soldiers on the AAU circuit. It was with the Soldiers that Vincent took the next step to improving his game, playing alongside another talented freshman this year, Arizona’s Stanley Johnson, and against players such as Duke’s Tyus Jones.</p>\n<p>Vincent’s place as the starting shooting guard was cemented before he even committed to Santa Barbara, according to Head Coach Bob Williams. He impressed the coaching staff that much. The problem was convincing him UCSB was the right place.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t really interested in Santa Barbara at first because I heard about the whole party scene,” Vincent said. “It didn’t seem businesslike at first.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were lobbying hard for him, he was wielding offers up and down the West Coast his junior year of high school. Offers from the University of Portland, Pacific and Utah State came in. In total, he was offered scholarships from 10 different schools, but not until he visited UCSB did his perspective on the campus change.</p>\n<p>“I just fell in love,” Vincent said. “As soon as I took my visit I said this is where I wanted to be.”</p>\n<p>With persistence from Assistant Coach Ryan Madry, Vincent signed in late September 2013 and proceeded to average 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.1 steals as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>Now with only Saturday’s game against Cal Poly left in the regular season, Vincent has for the most part shed the mistakes he was committing early in the season. What has helped his transition is how quickly he’s gelled with the team. In the season opener against Kansas in front of 16,300 screaming Jayhawks fans, it was just him and his teammates on the court.</p>\n<p>“I was still able to understand everyone on my team. It was almost as if I had been around them enough to that they were the only voices I heard,” Vincent said. “… The crowd just seemed like white noise.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60650\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1591443251\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61585\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60650\" data-attachment-id=\"60650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-09/late-run-gives-ucsb-thrilling-win-over-hawaii/the-gaucho-defense-holds-back-hawaii-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"The Gaucho defense holds back Hawaii.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>This season has seen him demonstrate his future potential. Against No. 22 Southern Methodist University in Dec., he knocked down the game-tying three pointer that sent the game into overtime. His best game offensively came Wednesday night at Hawaii, where he scored a career-high 25 points on 8-13 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>It is not surprising to hear how Vincent talks about his role as the team gets ready for the Big West Tournament next week. He knows the one-and-done nature of postseason play and realizes he needs be ready when the time comes.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing for something else, so it makes everything more important. It raises the stakes,” Vincent said. “I just think it’s import for everyone to embrace their role and not fight it.”</p>\n<p>So what keeps one of the frontrunners to the conference’s Freshman of the Year honor grounded? <em>Eyes to the sky</em>. That’s Vincent’s motto to remind him how he got here. He anticipates he might be the future of UCSB men’s basketball. Nonetheless, he remains even-keeled about the situation.</p>\n<p>“It’s the elephant in the room sometimes, but I try not to think about it too much,” he explained.</p>\n<p>For now, however, UCSB is more than satisfied with Vincent driving past defenders, setting his feet, snapping his wrist towards the basket, watching if the ball will go in. And Gabe always with his eyes to the sky.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of March 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Mark Salay is the sports editor for the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s.

Riding a season-high three-game conference win streak, the Gauchos face a Hawaii team that nearly defeated them at the Thunderdome the last time these two played.</p>\n<p>“They’re the most athletic team in the league,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They turn you over, they scramble the game up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has managed only three road wins on the year. However, they have all come at the expense of league opponents. Coming off wins against the top two teams in the Big West in UC Davis and UC Irvine, Santa Barbara’s mark currently stands at 9-5 in conference and 16-12 overall. The team is one game behind UCI for second place in league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re starting to roll a little bit on teams, and it’s just good for chemistry going forward,” junior forward Mitch Brewe said. “In a little over a week we have the Big West Tournament, so it’s good to get some momentum going into these upcoming weeks.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii, a team that battled early season adversity with the firing of its head coach and withdrawal of Preseason Big West First-Team forward Isaac Fotu, stands at 7-7 in conference and 19-11 overall. UH is locked in a tie for fifth place with UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara defeated the Rainbow Warriors earlier on the season 75-74 in a game Hawaii would like to have back. In that contest, the Gauchos trailed by as many as 13 points in the second half, but used the three-ball to claw their way back and take the lead.</p>\n<p>UH thought the game was headed to overtime after freshman guard Isaac Fleming knocked down a game-tying three with one second left. However, referees concluded after looking at instant replay that Fleming had his foot on the line, leaving the Rainbow Warriors with a one-point loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading scorer, senior center Alan “Big Al” Williams, missed out on the previous encounter since he was still recovering from a shoulder injury. Since his return, he has played like his usual self, recording double-doubles in three of his last four games. At 11.7 rebounds per game, Big Al leads the league in rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Big Al is a large man, and he has an incredible knack for getting the ball,” Brewe said. “The way he sheds defenders and sheds other guys on the court to get the rebounds is incredible.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have had their struggles on the road, the Rainbow Warriors have lost only two conference games at home. UCSB will also have to go up against the added intensity Hawaii will bring, given tonight’s game will be Senior Night for UH.</p>\n<p>This will be the final road game for Santa Barbara before it closes out the season at home against rival Cal Poly Saturday. With the Big West Tournament next week, the Gauchos take aim at finishing with momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much of seeding, every team in this league is good. Getting a lower seed might just be a sleeper game just like it was last year,” freshman guard Gabe Vincent said. “But it’s definitely just playing, seeing how well we execute and getting ourselves ready for what’s next.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set for 9 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Ware knocked down a jumper with 4:32 remaining to give the Gauchos a 17-9 lead as they built an early cushion, but the Big West’s reigning Athlete of the Week in Davis’s senior forward Sydnee Fipps answered back with a pair of triples to cut the lead to 17-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took a 21-17 lead into halftime, holding the Aggies to just 5-22 from the field as both teams struggled to find the basket.</p>\n<p>The second half told an entirely different story as both teams became hot from the field. A three-pointer by UCSB’s senior guard Kristine Brance broke a 27-27 tie to give the Gauchos a three point lead at the 13:55 mark. A pair of free throws by freshman forward Chaya Durr capped a 6-0 run which put UCSB up 36-29 with 10:44 left.</p>\n<p>The Aggies battled back, going on a 9-2 run of their own to cut the lead to 42-41 with 6:28 to go. The Gauchos were able to answer back with a late-game run, something they have not been able to do all year. Durr put in a pair of layups to give UCSB a 50-41 lead with just 1:36 remaining, capping off a crucial 8-0 run.</p>\n<p>Unlike the last time the two teams faced each other, Davis was not able to pull off a late comeback. Santa Barbara put the game away at the line, making seven free throws in the final 53 seconds to finish with a 57-52 win.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was up to the challenge on Saturday, forcing 21 turnovers while converting 13 points off of the Aggies’ mistakes. The Gauchos were also able to keep up with them on the boards and keep them away from the free throw line, two things they have struggled with all year. The Aggies were just 7-10 from the line while they only outrebounded UCSB 38-36.</p>\n<p>Fipps finished with a team-high 13 points and five rebounds while senior guard Kelsey Harris backed her up with 12 points and seven boards. Brance put in 10 points of her own while knocking down 2-6 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Both the Gauchos and the Aggies were able to turn their first half shooting woes around. UCSB went 13-28 from the field while Davis shot 13-29, including 6-13 from three-point range, but the difference came in the turnovers. The Gauchos turned the ball over just three times in the second half compared to eight for the Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to Santa Barbara this Thursday to play its 2015 home finale against Hawaii.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/gauchos-edge-uc-davis-for-second-win-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/gauchos-edge-uc-davis-for-second-win-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/gauchos-edge-uc-davis-for-second-win-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/gauchos-edge-uc-davis-for-second-win-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/gauchos-edge-uc-davis-for-second-win-of-the-season/","id":415,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[414,413,412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Grinds Out Win at Home Versus Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150228_mens_basketball_vsUCI_07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150228_mens_basketball_vsUCI_07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Late minute execution propelled the UCSB men's basketball team to a narrow 54-51 win against UC Irvine in front of over 4,500 in the Thunderdome.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61479\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150228_mens_basketball_vsUCI_07-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"238530620\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61500\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61479\" data-attachment-id=\"61479\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/mens-basketball-grinds-out-win-at-home-versus-irvine/20150228_mens_basketball_vsuci_07-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150228_mens_basketball_vsUCI_07-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Sam Aragon\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;'Big Al' Williams dominates an Anteater as he drives for the hoop.

I think we’re one of the best out here when we do what we do. We didn’t shoot it well [Saturday], but we still played well.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Zalmico Harmon’s three pointer with 1:25 left in regulation tilted the advantage in favor of UCSB, putting the score at 49-45 and forcing the Anteaters to foul the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>With five seconds on the game clock, Irvine’s senior forward Will Davis II got the Anteaters to within a point after scoring on a three-point play. After two free throws by Harmon, the Gauchos intentionally fouled sophomore guard Jaron Martin with 1.5 seconds left to prevent another three-point play. Martin missed both free throws to seal the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The key was to get stops, we’re a great team when we get stops,” Vincent said. “We were trying to find the inside-out with their zone and try to get to the middle, that way we could create more, and get the ball inside and get some layups.”</p>\n<p>Big Al was the difference for UCSB. Williams did not play against UCI in the season’s previous encounter, however, his defense Saturday on 7’6” Mamodou Ndiaye — the tallest player in Division I — forced the sophomore center into five turnovers and only six points. Williams made the night difficult for Ndiaye, who played a total of 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>Although the team shot only 40 percent from the field, Big Al’s boards helped offset the poor shooting night.</p>\n<p>“Al rebounding in the paint was phenomenal,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “The best thing we did all night was Al went and got rebounds, and then we took care of the ball, we didn’t turn it over. Those were our two keys offensively.”</p>\n<p>Junior forward John Green scored 14 points while junior guard Michael Bryson chipped in 11 points, four rebounds and two blocks.</p>\n<p>For UCI, Davis led the way with 16 points and was the only player to score in double-figures for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“In the first half [Davis] hurt us a little bit because he’s athletic, he’s pretty quick,” junior forward Mitch Brewe said. “He has good moves inside, but I think second half we thwarted his moves a little bit. We were able to keep him at bay.”</p>\n<p>In a game televised by ESPN2, a season-high 4,716 attended the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are back on the court Wednesday when they travel to Hawaii for a game set for 9 p.m. locally.</p>\n<p><em>Mark Salay is the sports editor for the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s.

UC Davis would knock down two opening threes, however, to take the early lead.</p>\n<p>After both teams traded baskets, junior guard John Green would slam home a dunk and UCSB followed by forcing a turnover at the other end. Junior guard Michael Bryson would cap it off with a momentum swinging three-pointer to give UCSB a 16-10 lead with 12:60 left in the half.</p>\n<p>However, the momentum would fade, as junior forward Josh Fox would sink two shots and sophomore center Neil Monson added a basket and a free throw for UC Davis. The rest of the first half seemed to go back-and-forth and the teams would eventually end in a 30-30 tie.</p>\n<p>The big story for UC Davis was its stellar field goal percentage of 50 percent and a perfect 8-8 mark from the line. For the Gauchos, their eight offensive rebounds and 10 forced turnovers led to a multitude of stops and second chances.</p>\n<p>Green was on fire to start the second half, scoring 11 points in the first five minutes of action. Coupled with a jump shot from Williams and stingy defense, the Gauchos would climb to a 43-36 lead with 14:52 remaining.</p>\n<p>“It was a tie game at half playing against the number one seed,” Green said. “I know I need to step up for the team and luckily I had the ball in my hands and made the right decisions.”</p>\n<p>With momentum swinging heavily to UCSB, UC Davis tried its best to get back in it with a jumper from sophomore guard Darius Graham and two made free throws from senior guard Avery Johnson to cut the lead to three.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos were relentless on both ends of the floor and seemed destined to put this one away. Junior guard Michael Bryson would get hot hitting two threes and junior guard DaJuan Smith would add a layup to propel the gauchos to a 48-40 lead with 12:51 remaining.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would once again try to climb back and after two made free throws and a jumper from Fox, the Aggies got to within four with 9:50 left. However, this is as close to a comeback as the team would come.</p>\n<p>Williams, Bryson, and senior guard Zalmico Harmon would continue to score and stifle any UC Davis rally. Harmon added three crucial late free throws and Williams scored the last three points of the contest to seal the deal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The officials weren’t making the calls this game, but that’s just part of the game,” Williams said. “At the end of the day my focus is about coming out and helping the team to play our best and get the win.”</p>\n<p>Bryson scored a game high 20 points for the Gauchos and Williams earned a double-double with 15 points and 16 rebounds. Overall the team shot 49.2 percent from the field and forced 16 turnovers.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>The Gauchos will be back in action this Saturday as they host UC Irvine at 9 p.m.</p><div

The Anteaters improved to 6-22 overall and took a two-game lead over Santa Barbara with a 3-10 mark in the Big West for the final playoff spot.</p>\n<p>With Irvine having swept UCSB and now clinching the head-to-head tie-breaker, the Gauchos would have to win their last three games while the Anteaters lose their last three in order to qualify for postseason play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Things were looking good early for Santa Barbara after a free-throw from sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos a 13-5 lead midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>However, the Anteaters immediately answered back to take the lead. A jumper by senior forward Methlyn Onogomuho with 6:08 left in the half put UCI up 15-13, capping off a 10-0 run.</p>\n<p>UCSB once again took the lead with just over two minutes before the half, as senior center Clair Watkins’ lay-up put her team up 19-18. This would be the Gauchos’ last lead of the game, as Irvine’s sophomore guard Irene Chavez took over from there.</p>\n<p>Just before the half ended, Chavez knocked down back-to-back three-pointers to give her team a 24-19 lead heading into the break. Jemerigbe put in a lay-up to start the second half, cutting the Anteaters’ lead to three before Chavez answered right back with a jumper to make it 26-21. On the following possession, Chavez hit another three-pointer, her fourth straight made basket, to push Irvine’s lead up to 29-21.</p>\n<p>From there, the Anteaters were able to hold UCSB at bay. A lay-up by UCSB’s freshman forward Chaya Durr cut the deficit to 45-35 with just under six minutes remaining. Irvine then went on an 11-3 run which included seven makes from the free-throw line as the Anteaters pushed their lead to 56-38, the largest it would be all game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished the game out on a 7-2 run, capped off by a steal and lay-up by junior point guard Dioseline Lopez as time ran out, but their second half efforts were not enough as they fell 58-46.</p>\n<p>Chavez finished her night with a game-high 18 points on 6-12 shooting off the bench. More impressively, she knocked down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ biggest weakness of late has been their poor rebounding, the difference in last night’s game came from the field. Both teams finished the night with 50 field-goal attempts, but UCSB was able to convert just 30 percent of its shots compared to 44 percent for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>UCSB was only outrebounded 37-32 on the night, an improvement from their -9.8 rebounding margin coming into the game. The Gauchos turned the ball over 16 times to Irvine’s 19 as both teams finished the night with 19 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ bench shot an impressive 66.7 percent from the field, but only attempted six shots. The starters shot just 25 percent as a unit. Junior guard Jasmine Ware was the only starter for Santa Barbara that finished with an efficient shooting night, going 6-9 from the field for a team-high 12 points.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a road game against UC Davis tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Durr</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For many young athletes hoping to play at the college level, the senior year of high school is the most important one of all. It’s where the good talents are separated from the great ones, where all those college scouts who haven’t been paying attention to you get their last chance to see what they’ll be missing out on if they don’t act fast enough. For freshman forward Chaya Durr of the UCSB women’s basketball team though, that chance never came.</p>\n<p>After spending much of her sophomore year at Sacramento High being the first name off the bench, Chaya became the team’s leader in her junior year. She consistently dominated opponents with her long and versatile body type and filled the stat-sheet on both sides of the floor, resulting in her being ranked as high as No. 38 in the nation among wing players.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off a tournament in Oregon in which she played what she described as “the best games I’ve ever played in my life,” Durr and her AAU team flew to Tennessee to play in another tournament. Then, at the top of her game and right before her all-important senior season began, disaster struck.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to get to the basket, I was dribbling the ball and I fell,” she said. “I wouldn’t necessarily say anybody hit me, I was just off-balanced, and that’s when I went down. It was really painful.”</p>\n<p>There are a select few injuries that every athlete dreads, and even without contact, Durr was handed one of the worst cards she could’ve drawn: she had torn her ACL and would miss her entire senior season.</p>\n<p>“I was really devastated,” she said. “I almost couldn’t stop crying because it was still really painful for a few days.”</p>\n<p>Although she would have to sit out for the next 11 months, Durr tried to take whatever positives she could from the situation.</p>\n<p>“I was thinking maybe it’s meant to be,” she said. “One of my friends told me that it was a minor setback for a major comeback, so that really motivated me a lot to rehab as much as I could when I could.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for Durr, who went to high school with current Gaucho teammate junior guard Jasmine Ware, UCSB’s presence was there every step of the way.</p>\n<p>“In recruiting Jasmine, we were able to watch Chaya play when she was in ninth and tenth grade,” Gauchos Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We knew that she would be one of those athletes that could be a program changer. We really felt that, so we were able to get her to campus early, get to meet our kids and see what our program was about.”</p>\n<p>Despite being faced with an injury that could have drastically impacted the next few years of her life, Durr’s dynamic play prior to her senior year had already earned her a spot at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately for her, but maybe fortunately for us, she did tear her ACL and we’ve been there since day one,” Mitchell said. “That’s probably how we ended up with her, a top 30 player in the country with athleticism, work ethic and a blue collar mentality. The sky’s just the limit with her.”</p>\n<p>With her final year of high school in the books, it didn’t take long for Durr to make her decision on where she would play in college.</p>\n<p>“I committed to Santa Barbara right after [the injury] happened,” she said. “Santa Barbara was the place I had wanted to be forever. My biggest motivation was to get strong for college, because I am going to that next level and it’s going to be bigger and better competition.”</p>\n<p>After a lengthy rehab process, Durr finally returned to the court prior to her freshman year, making her first appearance in a UCSB uniform against Occidental in an exhibition game. In just 14 minutes, she scored nine points to go along with 10 rebounds and two steals, immediately proving her value to her new team.</p>\n<p>“It was our first game, so of course I was nervous, but I went out and I played really well,” she said. “At that moment I knew coach could trust me; that I could get in and get it done.”</p>\n<p>In a season with more downs than ups for a struggling Gaucho team, Durr’s strong performances have been some of the few bright spots this year. After seeing limited time during the first month of play, she again showed her worth in a home game against Washington State, recording her first double-digit scoring performance with ten points. However, it was on the defensive side where she truly shined, as she recorded five steals, tied for the most of any Gaucho this season.</p>\n<p>“Defense is my thing. It’s all I really care about,” Durr said. “That’s always been my favorite thing since high school. I know that when I play good defense and I’m getting steals that that leads to the offensive side.”</p>\n<p>Another month later against CSU Bakersfield, Durr recorded multiple career-highs with 15 points and eight rebounds, further proving that her ACL was no longer an issue.</p>\n<p>“The knee is way in the past,” she said. “I forget I even tore it at some point.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, against Cal State Northridge just one week later, Chaya suffered a concussion, causing her to miss the next nine games of Big West play. Once again, the injury was extremely untimely.</p>\n<p>“When she went down with her concussion, she was probably in the form that we saw in high school,” Coach Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>In her return game against Cal State Fullerton, despite only playing six minutes, Chaya may have helped provide the spark that would see the Gauchos win just their first game of the year.</p>\n<p>“Right when I got in, I got two back-to-back rebounds, which is what our team was struggling with,” she said. “I was just really excited to be back. I probably couldn’t stop smiling, it was just really tough sitting out even a month because I know what it feels like to sit out and it’s not a good feeling at all.”</p>\n<p>With just four games remaining and the Gauchos still with a chance to make it to the Big West Tournament, they will take every contribution they can get.</p>\n<p>With Durr finally back and healthy once more, both her play and her infectious personality could be just what UCSB needs to extend its postseason.</p>\n<p>“Mentally it’s really hard to come back from injury, but you can never tell because of how happy she is and the fighter she has inside of her,” Ware said. “She’s there when you need her the most. If I threw a bad pass or something, she’s going to try and save it for me. She’s just a real team player and there’s nothing more you can ask for.”</p>\n<p>Success might not necessarily be coming to UCSB this season, but with a versatile team player like Durr set to grace the Thunderdome court over the next few years, the future is bright for the Gauchos. With her big injury now behind her, the stage is set for Durr and her team to show everyone what they can accomplish together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of

records in the conference, tonight’s matchup between the two could have huge postseason implications.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters enter in eighth place in the Big West at 5–22 overall and 2–10 in conference play. At 1–24 overall and 1–11 in the conference, the Gauchos’ last remaining hope of finishing with the No. 8 seed and qualifying for the Big West Tournament will come down to overtaking Irvine over the last four games of the regular season, starting with tonight’s game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be playing a very hungry Irvine team because we’re both trying to battle it out just to get into the tournament,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They’re extremely athletic, but if we can carry over the positive things we did against Fullerton, it should give us an opportunity to get a good win on the road.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, they are coming off their best two-game stretch of the year, starting with last Thursday’s game against UC Riverside in which a season-high four players scored in double-digits in a 71-65 loss.</p>\n<p>Their momentum reached its highest point all season on Saturday when they put on a defensive exhibition, holding the Big West’s leader in three-point attempts to just 5-26 shooting from beyond the arc. The Gauchos defeated Cal State Fullerton 48-39 to grab their first NCAA win in 364 days, ending a 29-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“We know what it feels like now to win,” junior guard Jasmine Ware said. “We want to keep feeling that feeling. Keep winning. Do what we did [against Fullerton] but even better.”</p>\n<p>The main point of emphasis for the Gauchos over the last several weeks has been their rebounding. Their rebounding margin of -9.8 per game is worst in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding. There’s no doubt about it,” Mitchell said when asked what it would take for UCSB to get another win. “They have big athletes inside, they’re strong. We have to limit them to one shot and done and get out.”</p>\n<p>One of the big athletes being referred to is UCI’s forward Mokun Fajemisin. Since the start of Big West play, the 6’0” sophomore averages 13.4 points to go along with her second-best conference mark of 9.3 rebounds per game. The last time the two teams played on January 29, Fajemisin dominated the paint to the tune of a 14 point, 15 rebound, four block stat line.</p>\n<p>“We gave them way too many second chance points last time,” Mitchell said. “We had our hands full with them [at home], but as we did [against Fullerton], when you force turnovers, we’ve got to turn those into points on the other end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB has not had a standout scorer all season, it has most often found itself in a position to win late in games behind strong defense and a balanced offensive force. As the Gauchos are going up against the only team in the conference with a worse shooting percentage than them, a strong defensive effort could be what it takes to help keep their postseason hopes alive.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been fortunate that we’ve had kids who have been very consistent in our practice efforts since day one,” Mitchell said. “It’s nice to see them smile after the win, but you can’t be satisfied with one.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Irvine are set to tip-off tonight at 7 p.m. in the Bren Center.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 26, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/playoff-hopes-on-the-line-against-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/playoff-hopes-on-the-line-against-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/playoff-hopes-on-the-line-against-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/playoff-hopes-on-the-line-against-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/playoff-hopes-on-the-line-against-uc-irvine/","id":445,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[444,443,442],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Top Two Teams in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's basketball prepares for its biggest week of the season starting with tonight's home game against UC Davis, followed by Saturday's game versus UC Irvine.

Now in a tie for third in the conference with four games left, Santa Barbara takes aim at the same opponents this week — the same teams that hold the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in the conference, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We like where we are because it kind of puts us in an underdog position, so we kind of have that pressure,” senior guard Zalmico Harmon said. “As we’ve shown throughout the year in even overtime losses, we actually do a lot better with pressure on us, and we have a lot of resiliency to come back and play well at the later half of games.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At 7-5 in the Big West and 14-12 overall, the Gauchos sit two games back of UCI whom they play Saturday at home. Attaining the top seed will be an uphill battle as the Aggies (11-1 league, 21-4 overall) — tonight’s opponent — have a stranglehold on the position.</p>\n<p>Davis, a team that won a total of four conference games last year, is by no means a fluke. A lot of the team’s success can be attributed to its star player in guard Corey Hawkins. The 6’3” senior leads the league in points per game with 20.8, more than three points ahead of second place Mike Caffey of Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got a firsthand look at the damage Hawkins is capable of inflicting from his previous encounter with UCSB when he went off for 28 points, the most points scored in a conference game this season by him. Guarding the perimeter is one way to keep him off the score sheet; he tops the conference in three-point shooting at 52.8 percent and torched the Gauchos with six made treys on eight attempts.</p>\n<p>“He scores a lot every time he plays, he’s a pretty good player,” Taylor said. “We just have to take away his three-ball and just be on him every time he touches the ball, give him no space and have great help defense. It’s going to be a team effort.”</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, last week saw the return of Big Al. Williams was kept out of seven games because of shoulder problems, but in his two games back, he averaged 13.5 points and 8.5 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Also missing from the last time UCSB faced Davis was Harmon due to the flu. With their full starting lineup in, the Gauchos look to capitalize on their home-court advantage.</p>\n<p>“This time it’s different because we got Al and we got [Harmon] back,” sophomore guard Eric Childress said. “We’re basically going with the same strategy as before, but we have our captains back now. They’re going to bring the energy up for us, and we’re going to come together and pull this one out.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for tonight’s game at the Thunderdome is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 26, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Mark Salay is the sports editor for the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s.

The Warriors had a brief absence of Bogut, but that was nowhere near enough to throw them off course with their other weapons. And don’t believe for a minute that Steph is actually hurt right now.</p>\n<p>Atlanta plays a style of ball that would succeed without some of their pieces, but luckily for them, that hasn’t presented itself yet.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Grizzlies missed out on Z-Bo for a long stint early on, but since his return they have looked nearly perfect. Conley has also been in and out of the lineup a bit, but even in their absence, they stayed with the Warriors on top of the tough Western Conference. This resilience from these teams keeps them atop the power rankings once again as the only squads with 40+ wins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1) Golden State Warriors (43-10, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​One of the reasons for this team’s ability to avoid injury this year is smart moves from Kerr such as his recent choice to sit Steph with his soreness. The team is opening up a six game road trip and although they got their 10<sup>th</sup> loss they will surely have a better chance in the next five with a rested MVP candidate. Best record in the NBA despite the ATL season-high win streak. That speaks volumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2) Memphis Grizzlies (41-14, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​They do say Defense wins championships. A Western Conference finals between these top two teams could be one for the ages and remind us all of the recent Seahawks v. Broncos Super Bowl. We all know how that turned out. The Grizzlies won both their games in this short week including last nights close battle with the Clippers. Holding Lob City to under 90 points is something to be proud of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3) Atlanta Hawks (44-12, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Rounding out the top three for the second straight week is this Hawks squad who has definitely cooled off from that streak that I mentioned earlier. Just 4-4 in the month of February due to some offensive troubles has people questioning the team’s depth and durability. This can’t be proven at the moment though, give them a chance to get out of the rut from the All-Star break.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4) Cleveland Cavaliers (35-22, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​This team is seriously starting to look scary. Really any move that they could’ve made before the trade deadline would’ve benefited them, besides maybe sending away Lebron, but now they truly look like a deep and talented enough team to make a run in their first year together. The chemistry is building and it’s only going to go up from here. Toronto and Chicago, your spots are no longer safe. Good luck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5) Houston Rockets (38-18, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Their one spot drop isn’t on their behalf by any means; the Cav’s pickups were just too strong. I hate to move them down too, with James Harden playing like he is right now. The man is literally willing this team to every win and making a solid MVP case for himself along the way. Don’t forget this team (just Harden) is doing this all without Dwight Howard as well. When he gets back, the defense may be in good enough form to win a round or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6) Los Angeles Clippers (37-20, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Tough loss to the mighty defense of the Grizzlies without star Blake Griffin, but a couple W’s before that helped the pursuit to a higher seed. If they can outlast this hack-a-DJ phase or if DeAndre can just learn to shoot them, then they should be able to move up at least a spot or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7) Dallas Mavericks (38-20, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Amaré looked so good in his first minutes as a Maverick that I thought his jersey was orange and Nash was feeding him. This team has all the tools to compete and right now they could land anywhere between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup> seeds and that’s not bad in the West but they will surely be playing some tough competition to start. They have a harsher schedule than most teams around their seeding ahead so home court advantage is going to take work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8) Toronto Raptors (37-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​This new starting lineup looks as good as the hype is treating it, but a loss to an AD-less Pelicans team is a tough one to swallow for The North. They’re one of few teams that has under 20 losses but when you look at their division, which they have a 13 game advantage over, it isn’t hard to tell why.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9) San Antonio Spurs (34-22, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Let’s just say that the last time I wrote this blog, this team had 34 wins… Taking losses from teams like the Jazz just isn’t going to cut and for once in this millennium, this mighty franchise may be showing some wear and tear. Kawhi isn’t providing the spark and the big 3 is settling down. 5-5 in their last ten games took a toll on them as they hang on to the seventh seed currently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10) Chicago Bulls (36-21, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The defense just hasn’t been there this year and how could you expect it when you add an offensive player like Gasol and Butler comes out of his shell? The team gets to play quite a few games in a row at home this week which would be nice except that they have a better road record. Derrick Rose needs to wake up from hibernation that started with his first injury and lead this team again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>11) Portland Trailblazers (36-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​With a struggling Nick Batum, the Blazers made a breakthrough pickup in trading for an offensive Aaron Afflalo. This without a doubt makes them a scarier team than they already were but if LA can’t stay in the game, we’ll know for sure that the team should’ve shut him down at the first sight of that injury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12) Oklahoma City Thunder (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Holding on to the eighth seed will not be as difficult of a task with a nearly brand new team that emerged post trade-deadline. Depth was an issue with this team and now the frontcourt has more potential than ever. Russell Westbrook has forgotten KD’s absence and is making a case for himself as the League’s most valuable player. When’s the last time two separate guys on the same team won back-to-backs?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>13) Milwaukee Bucks (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Bringing the defending ROY to your squad can never really hurt but we will have to see if the young guard spoils the chemistry or not, Knight was a perfect piece to this team but building for the future is never a bad thing to do, ask any team that is dominant now. Jabari Parker was a favorite for ROY this year before injury, they could have had back to backs. When’s the last time that happened either?</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><strong>14) Washington Wizards (33-23, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​A team riding a three game skid and has only won two games in the last ten. For those of you mathematicians out there, that means they have picked up over 33 percent of their losses just in those last 10 games alone. Playing without Beal has shown their soft spot and just like the Spurs, they have the same amount of wins as they did in last week’s rankings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>15) Phoenix Suns (29-28, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Yet another team to go winless in the past week. Can’t exactly blame them when trying to implement an entire new lineup after so many moves on deadline day. A team that was once overloaded with guards may have found a good mix in the Knight-Bledsoe duo. If they can get cooking, then the Thunder may have to actually start worrying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16) Detroit Pistons (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Reggie Jackson undoubtedly adds a necessary depth to this team’s backcourt and with the playoff race as tight as it is, this team now has a legitimate chance. They have the talent and the coaching, they just need to put the two together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>17) New Orleans Pelicans (29-27, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The third team in the battle for the West’s eight seed does not look like a heavy contender if AD can’t get his body right. He tried to deliver what looked like a hit stick and ironically destroyed himself in the process, which is never a good sign. He and Ryan Anderson will be out for quite a bit so Tyreke will get the green light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>18) Indiana Pacers (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Still on the rise winning seven of their last ten and their last three straight. A mixture of Stuckey and Hill has been a recipe for an unstoppable offense as they have sparked Indiana to a playoff team once again. By playoff team, I of course just mean that they have a seed. I wouldn’t exactly call them a playoff team just because of that. They have too much left to prove after this season’s start. PG return, come soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>19) Boston Celtics (21-33, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Isaiah Thomas was a big step forward and on the same day they took a big step back losing their best player Sully once again. Along with that IT is showing his old Kings style of play getting thrown out of his first Celtics-Lakers rivalry game. The combo of Smart and Thomas could be enough to snag an eighth seed but they have some catching up to do and without Sullinger it won’t be easy. Impressive win over Suns last night, but a loss to the Lakers? Really?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>20) Charlotte Hornets (22-32, -3)</strong></p>\n<p>​They and the Suns are tied for the biggest skid at the moment standing at five straight losses. Before hopping on this losing streak they held control of the seventh spot in the East and now have fallen to 11<sup>th</sup> behind Detroit and a hot Indiana. Mo Williams was supposed to be able to fill-in in Walker’s absence but this team can’t wait much longer for his return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>21) Brooklyn Nets (23-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Maybe got a little confidence in their thrashing of the Nuggets last night but we will see how far that will carry them. They made a great move in swapping KG for Thad Young, which gives them a little more depth for the future. This team has been playing .500 basketball as of late but in the eighth spot, that may not cut it. Time for their many vets to get going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>22) Utah Jazz (21-34, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​An impressive running through over the defending champions last night that followed an even more impressive win over the Blazers. The dealing of Enes Kanter allowed for Gobert to take more minutes and the defense looks better than ever since the trade. Defense is really what they lacked in so this is the most positive sign they’ve seen all year. The west may be too brutal for any luck this year though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>23) Miami Heat (24-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of the Dragic boys was the talk of the trade deadline but that happened just following it with Chris Bosh without a doubt has a bigger impact. I wish Bosh a speedy and efficient recovery but in the meantime Dragic and Hassan better figure out a way to keep a playoff seed. This point guard may be the best that D-Wade has ever had, but his success seems to be independent of that in his career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>24) Sacramento Kings (19-35, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>Only snagging three out their last ten games isn’t going to impress future Hall of Famer George Karl. Since arriving Karl has flipped the pace of the offense, which has now happened to this team a total of three times on the season. Give them a chance to get into the flow of things and maybe next year they’ll have another hot start; maybe one that they can stay on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>25) Orlando Magic (19-39, +3)</strong></p>\n<p>​A three game win streak says a lot about new interim head coach James Borrego and a 4-2 overall record is nothing to scoff at with the team he has adopted. Let’s just try not to focus on the fact that they beat the Sixers, Lakers, and Knicks and give him a round of applause.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>26) Minnesota Timberwolves (12-43, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Really? Kevin Garnett? Please don’t even try to lie and convince me that this was purely a basketball move, sending away a young kid with potential for the greatest player in that franchise’s history, who is older than some coaches and plays like it. I understand drawing fans and making money, but at least try to hide it better. I thought this was a building season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>27) Denver Nuggets (20-36, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The most positive part about their trade deadline play was getting rid of some heavy contracts that frees up space for other players. The only question more interesting than what will happen to this team, is what will happen to our Gaucho Brian Shaw?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>28) Philadelphia 76ers (12-44, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Here I am thinking that MCW was the guard that they waited so long to get, but I guess I thought the same about Nerlens and Embiid  as well. MCW played one year, balled out, and got shipped out for some pieces that put this team in an interesting place. With McDaniels leaving as well, they fall back into the category where dumb fans will ask if they can even beat Kentucky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>29) Los Angeles Lakers (14-41, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​An overtime victory over the rival Celtics is enough to pull you out of last place in my eyes, without bias. But the team better watch out and not grab too many victories or they may be losing their top, and really only draft pick this year. Oh and by the way, they are pretty close to a franchise worst record. It’d be for the best to get it though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>30) New York Knicks (10-45, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Hey nobody is in single digits, that’s something to celebrate. That’s about all one can celebrate with Melo being shut down for the rest of the season. With this record another upside is of course a possible first pick on the way to try and straighten out Melo’s team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61291\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61291\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/","id":448,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[447,446,445],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":25,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
