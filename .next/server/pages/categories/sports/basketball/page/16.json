Helping steer the 49ers’ scoring was senior point guard Anna Kim with four points during the stretch.</p>\n<p>Kim finished with a team-high 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting along with four rebounds, three assists, and one steal.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s lethargic start simply stemmed from its shots not falling. Although it managed to chip away at Long Beach’s lead as the game progressed, UCSB ended shooting 35.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first basket for UCSB was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a layup in the post. Despite outrebounding LBSU 41-28, Santa Barbara still had to counter the 49ers’ attempt to shut down the paint.</p>\n<p>Edelman recorded her ninth double-double of the season, her second of the Big West Tournament, with 14 points and tied her career-high of 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Getting down low was a challenge as UCSB went 3-of-14 from the field (21.4 percent) with Porter netting the final two scores from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Long Beach State’s defensive press was successful in disrupting UCSB’s pace on offense as the 49ers held the Gauchos scoreless for 4:36 of the final five minutes of the first quarter, allowing the Beach to take a 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A 10-4 run to open the second period sustained the 49ers’ double-figure lead, increasing it to 28-12 following a made jumpshot by senior guard Raven Benton to jumpstart the string of points. Benton had 12 points while going 5-of-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>With the momentum shifting in favor of Long Beach State, UCSB looked to trim its deficit after calling a timeout with 4:55 remaining before halftime.</p>\n<p>Providing the first step toward cutting the lead was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with a long range make. On the Gauchos’ next possession, it was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler with the defensive rebound and drive on the other end of the court for a layup that reduced UCSB’s deficit to 17-28.</p>\n<p>Another layup by Toler helped bring UCSB within a 10-point margin, but free-throws and a jumpshot by the 49ers’ Gigi Hascheff gave LBSU a 33-19 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>Giving LBSU its largest lead of 19 points was Kim with a make from behind the perimeter as the 49ers went up 38-19.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained focused and had a 16-2 scoring outburst that catapulted the team to possibly achieve the come from behind victory.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 36.4 percent and 25 percent from behind the three-point line in the quarter, UCSB’s defense helped to produce on the offensive side of the ball.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Long Beach State to just nine points as the 49ers went 3-of-16 (18.8 percent) and 1-of-6 from long range (16.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“It had to start with our defense,” Henrickson said. “We were active. I think we had more deflections in a five minute stretch than we did in the whole first half. That’s who we need to be consistently. We made the run because we started to guard.”</p>\n<p>The run included a 7-of-8 performance at the free-throw line, in which Toler knocked down her pair to ignite UCSB.</p>\n<p>Uplifting the Gauchos’ spirit was a made three-pointer by Porter to finally trim LBSU’s lead to single figures at 40-31.</p>\n<p>Both a pair of made free-throws by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and a make from three-point range by Hernandez led to UCSB’s deficit being 35-40. A trip to the free-throw line for LBSU’s Benton allowed the 49ers to take a 42-35 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to outscore the 49ers 20-14, the clutch emergence of senior forward Madison Montgomery for LBSU was pivotal to the game’s final result.</p>\n<p>Montgomery scored 10 of her 14 points in the final period, six of which came from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>But it was the best scoring quarter for UCSB who had a 63.6 field goal percentage and was able to gain a 51-49 lead with 2:27 remaining in regulation after a three-point make by Toler, who had nine of her game-high 16 points in the game’s last 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>However, responding with baskets after losing the lead twice was Montgomery with a layup and eventual three-pointer that led to a 54-53 lead for LBSU. Extending the lead to 56-53 was a layup by senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer.</p>\n<p>Two trips to the free-throw line ended with Toler making 1-of-2 attempts at the line before UCSB was in the position of having the game’s final possession while facing a 55-56 deficit.</p>\n<p>Able to draw up a play following a replay review, UCSB made sure it got the ball to its ‘go-to’ player in Porter, whose shot didn’t fall just seconds before the final play clock buzzed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/","id":530,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[529,528,527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pulls Off Upset Over No. 1 Seed UC Davis, Face LBSU on Saturday in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=804%2C470&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team continues to inch closer to claiming its 15th Big West title after defeating UC Davis.

It’s been a long road so to just have the opportunity to play in the championship is mind blowing. I never pictured we would be here, but here we are,” senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe said.</p>\n<p>Following the career performance their teammate Sarah Porter the previous night, both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler emerged as the Gauchos’ leading scorers en route to their win over the conference title favorite.</p>\n<p>The backcourt duo combined for 44 points. Jemerigbe recorded a new career-high in points with 21. Toler’s 23 points was also a new career-high as she was responsible for all 23 of UCSB’s bench points, helping the Gauchos outscore UC Davis 23-2 in the statistical category. Her 10 made field goal off 17 shot attempts also is a career best mark.</p>\n<p>“The energy Drea and Onome provided us on the defensive end and how much they attacked and got to the rim was the difference offensively, “Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 10-for-10 shooting performance in the third quarter was the game’s deciding factor, forcing the Aggies to play catch-up against a streaking Gauchos team. Santa Barbara ended Friday with a 50 percent field goal percentage (27-of-54) and 42.9 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>After earning a bye in the first two rounds of the Big West Tournament, UC Davis came out of the gates looking like a team that was possibly on its way to a blowout victory. It gained a 7-0 lead through nearly three and a half minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Helping create the early lead was both junior guard Rachel Nagel and redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch. As one of the topm post players in the Big West, Bertsch scored the Aggies’ first basket. The scoring stretch also included a three-pointer by the team’s sharpshooter in Nagel, who finished with a team-high 18 points.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing the Aggies to shoot 42. 9 percent, UCSB held their star play in Bertsch to just 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting before eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>“We just felt like we needed to defend in transition, because Bertsch rim runs as well as anybody,” Henrickson said. “Even though we lost to them earlier, we felt confident if we could get another shot and defend them in transition we would at least give ourselves a shot to be successful. That was much better for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of a timeout, UCSB managed to recuperate along with the help of subbing in Toler, who scored four-straight points off go-ahead layups. Knotting the score at seven apiece was Porter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Joining Toler was Jemerigbe with drives to the paint to give the Gauchos their first lead of the game at 11-9. Back and forth scoring between the two teams led to a 15-13 lead for UC Davis after a made jump shot by Nagel.</p>\n<p>The pace of play would slow down with both teams exchanging scores as ties and lead changes occurred. A three-point differential was the largest margin between the two.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining, Porter knocked down a shot from beyond the arc to put UCSB up 29-27. But a made halfcourt shot to beat the buzzer by Nagel gave UC Davis a 30-29 lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>With both teams vying for momentum, the third quarter worked in favor of UCSB outscoring UC Davis 23-15.</p>\n<p>A 7-0 run with contributions from Toler, redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, and capped off by a made three-pointer by Jemerigbe propelled UCSB to a 40-34 lead. Edelman finished scored nine of her 12 points in the quarter as she concluded with a 4-of-7 shooting and four rebound night.</p>\n<p>Complementing Edelman was Jemerigbe with 10 of her 21 points in the period. The senior scored the team’s only two three-pointers during the quarter and ended it with a layup that increased UCSB’s lead to 52-45 heading into the final 10 minutes of regulation.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer by junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh cut the Gauchos’ lead to 59-54, bringing Davis within its smallest deficit of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Yet, an 8-2 scoring stretch sparked by a long range make by Toler which ended with a three-pointer by sophomore guard Coco Miller led to a 67-56 UCSB lead with 2:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>It would not be enough time for an Aggie comeback as a steal and go-ahead layup by Toler provided the finishing touch to UCSB securing its semifinal victory before closing with Porter at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Long Beach State will play Saturday, March 11 at 4 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim. The game will be nationally televised on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/","id":529,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[528,527,526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Porter Etches Name in UCSB and Big West History in UCSB Quarterfinal Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=798%2C402&ssl=1","description":"Big-time player show up in big-time games.

Whether when coming off screens, off the dribble or even contested, Porter’s hot shooting hand was consistent as she made 6-of-6 three-pointers and two free-throws in the game’s first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Balancing Porter’s three-point shooting was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a dominant performance in the paint. For a third time this season, Edelman tied her career-high of 22 points. Also, Edelman’s game-high 14 rebounds led to her tallying her eighth double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Signs of Porter’s career night began with her scoring the game’s first basket form long range. From that point on, both teams exchanged scores. Responding on UCR’s behalf was Malou Thiebaut De Kergret with a made three-pointer to give the Highlanders a 10-8 lead. The sophomore forward had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting before fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>The one-point deficit was the last time UCSB trailed before responding with a 15-0 run. Sparking the run was Porter with her third-straight three-pointer at the 4:53 mark of the first. The Gauchos’ lead increased from a layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler to 23-10, leading to UCR calling a timeout as it had been held scoreless for a little over five minutes.</p>\n<p>Toler concluded Wednesday night with 13 points, eight assists, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Breaking the Highlanders’ scoring slump was a jumpshot by junior guard Michelle Curry. Junior guard Lauren Holt scored on UCR’s next possession to cut their deficit to single digits at 14-23.</p>\n<p>But another three-pointer by Porter in the final five second of the first quarter gave UCSB a 26-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being down to start the second quarter, Curry took matters into her own hands, embarking on an individual 8-2 run that cut UCSB’s lead to 28-22. She scored 11 of her team-high 22 points in the period.</p>\n<p>Although Riverside managed to contain Porter’s perimeter shooting during the quarter, holding her to just one missed shot attempt, UCSB responded with a 7-2 run of its own. The scoring stretch built its lead to 35-24.</p>\n<p>UCR cut the Gaucho’s lead to a five-point deficit three times during the period as a made free-throw by Curry left the Highlanders down 37-42 entering halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 40-26 advantage in both rebounds and points in the paint. The outcome of both values led to Edelman’s big night, which picked up at the start of the second half as she scored the Gauchos first six points of the third.</p>\n<p>Still, the Highlanders continued to claw away at Santa Barbara’s lead. After Curry’s jumpshot brought UCR within three at 48-51 before a layup by UCSB’s Toler, Kergret knocked down a three-pointer on Riverside’s next possession that resulted in a 51-53 deficit with 4:49 remaining in the third.</p>\n<p>As UCSB was in a position of possibly losing its lead, emerging was Porter from beyond the arc to give it a 56-51 lead. Igniting the Gaucho’s 11-4 run to end the period was a three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. Toler scored the team’s last field goal with a layup, helping UCSB enter the fourth with a 67-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Similar to how the game began, Edelman and Porter scored UCSB’s first points in the game’s final period to put the Gauchos up 72-61.</p>\n<p>Porter scored her coveted ninth three-pointer of the game with 5:18 remaining, giving UCSB a 77-63 lead. Both teams would end up trading baskets and taking trips to the free-throw line with Edelman scoring the Gauchos’ last field goal of the game to eventually lock up their victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Davis this Friday, March 10 in the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament at noon. ESPN3 will provide coverage of the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/","id":517,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[516,515,514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Uncharted Destiny: Toler & Porter Find Best Fit in UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Any amount of time spent away from a sport is one of the most difficult experiences a student-athlete can endure.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite being California natives, Toler from Inglewood and Porter from San Diego, the decision to pack things up and come to Santa Barbara was not a simple sign-and-release process.</p>\n<p>As roommates and members of the Gauchos’ backcourt, Toler and Porter both sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules.</p>\n<p>According to <em>ncaa.org</em>, “Under the basic transfer regulations, you must spend an academic year in residence at the school to which you are transferring.”</p>\n<p>Both players redshirted last season, giving Toler her current redshirt junior status while Porter still has two years remaining as a redshirt sophomore.</p>\n<p>Toler transferred from the University of Oregon, while Porter spent her first year of her collegiate career at the University of Mississippi, but this doesn’t tell all about their past experiences.</p>\n<p>Although both could participate in team practices and dress for play, the regulation prohibited the two from playing during the regular season and postseason, leaving them anxious and eager on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Toler expressed that it “was beneficial in being able to learn, but tough in being limited to only cheering for teammates and not being able to actually play.”</p>\n<p>Expressing similar sentiments to her teammate, Porter assured that although it was a learning experience it was also “bittersweet because of the inability to play the game I love.”</p>\n<p>Before making the transition to UCSB, the start to each of their careers was not a structured beginning when looking back at their recruiting experiences.</p>\n<p>The recruiting process can be one full of clouded judgment as the constant phone calls, visits and promises can either enhance or deter one from making the most suitable decision.</p>\n<p>The current state of the recruitment process has been shifted over the years as out-of-state universities now make more of an effort to recruit student athletes from all over the country. The response to the search has been kind as players are intrigued by the thought of a change in scenery.</p>\n<p>Even so, this change hasn’t always warranted a promising outcome. It tends to only scratch the surface, showing what’s most appealing to the eye, sometimes leading student athletes to make questionable decisions.</p>\n<p>Although Toler ended up staying on the West Coast for her first two years of college, the journey to becoming a duck wasn’t a pre-determined destination.</p>\n<p>“Coming out of high school was hard. When I first came out, I actually committed to Sarah’s school, Ole Miss. It was the first school I went to and I just committed without knowing too much about it. I feel like that was more of a freshman thing to do.”</p>\n<p>The period of uncertainty led to Toler’s eventual commitment to Oregon. A change in head coaches between her freshman and sophomore seasons, however, influenced her decision to leave the school.</p>\n<p>Despite her undersized frame, Toler’s speed, ability to drive and court vision were each areas of her game which she believed UCSB catered to, making this the next best school for her.</p>\n<p>“Once I came [to UCSB], it was different because I knew what to look for [regarding] the coaching, type of system and what the school offered academic-wise,” Toler said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a coveted high school career helped build up Porter’s reputation, who became well-known for her scoring ability, as she left Horizon Christian Academy as a member of its 1,000-point club with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>“I actually originally committed to Fresno State coming out of high school, but the coaches left, so I reopened my recruiting process,” Porter explained. “Ole Miss sounded amazing to me, [but] I kind of went blind into the situation because I didn’t know the coaches that well, which is why it ended up not working out.”</p>\n<p>In the cases of Toler and Porter, it is plausible that the prestige of each of their former universities being within Power Five conferences set the stage for where they thought their future resided.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season on the bench, Porter’s consistency as the Gauchos’ go-to shooter helped land her within the starting lineup as a stretch guard/forward.</p>\n<p>“The third time around, I knew what I wanted to look for,” Porter said. “I wanted to come to a school where I felt comfortable with the coaching staff, the academics were good and they had everything they needed to offer me.”</p>\n<p>Following the end of last season, in which only three seniors graduated, it was a wonder as to how exactly either player would fit into a team with four of its starters returning.</p>\n<p>Understanding that there are no guarantees, especially pertaining to the court, Toler and Porter have certainly answered any concerns prior to entering this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping UCSB capture the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament, each player confirmed the anticipation that surrounded them following their redshirt seasons.</p>\n<p>Toler ended the regular season tied for the conference lead in assists per game with a 4.4 average. Primarily coming off the bench, Toler finished atop the Big West in assists per 40 minutes at 8.3 as well. She also ranked second-best on the team in scoring in conference games at 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Porter was another valuable piece as her three-point shooting led to her being one of the top perimeter shooters in the Big West. Her 38.1 three-point percentage during the regular season ranked seventh. Most notably, she placed third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 61, which currently ranks sixth most in a single-season in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>It was unfortunate that the two were forced to sit out during the hype of the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.

Powell brought in eight points in the first half as well as six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Mustang roster, senior guard Ridge Shipley and sophomore guard Donovan Fields led Cal Poly, going eight and six respectively in the first period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shooting started off with a jump shot from Powell and a quick three-pointer in response from Fields. Both teams traded baskets consistently until the 12th minute when only four points were scored, one from Mustang junior guard Victor Joseph and the other from Gaucho junior forward J.D. Slajchert, until 7:40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The score was kept relatively close until the sixth minute when UCSB made a small charge to take the lead 23-18, thanks to a surge of energy from freshman guard Max Heidegger along with Powell. After a three-pointer from Shipley at 3:54, no further points were scored in the first period, putting the score at 27-23 Gauchos at the half. </span></p>\n<p>At no point did the Mustangs ever catch up to the Gauchos; the closest they came to closing the lead was right at the beginning of the second period with a jump shot one minute in from junior forward Luke Meikle, bringing the score to 27-25.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to score 30 in the second half, 12 of which came exclusively from Childress. Overall, Childress led the board with 19 points, the next closest scorers only bringing in 10 each. He had a great game with three steals and two assists.</span></p>\n<p>Junior forward Alex Hart only put four on the board tonight, a few less than he has been lately, but managed to snatch up 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to run away with the score, starting with a jump shot from freshman guard Christian Terrell. From 16:49 to 11:47, UCSB brought in 14 points while Cal Poly had seven missed shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last five minutes of the game were characterized by a three-pointer and jump shot by Heidegger and four foul shots from Childress as well as a three-pointer from Victor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came away with a 39.0 field goal percentage, well above Cal Poly’s 30.5. Santa Barbara had 45 rebounds and profited 13 points off of turnovers while the Mustangs had 36 rebounds and made six points off of turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 16 points from the Gaucho bench, 10 of which belonged to Heidegger, who continues to improve and play with fire and speed. In the last few games, the younger members of the team have truly grown, hopefully leading to a successful 2017-2018 season for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p>In the end, UCSB will only be losing one senior in Childress, but the guard will be a tough replacement to find, not just on the court, but off it.</p>\n<p>Childress ends his career with the third-most assist in UCSB history (407), and the second-most steals (153).</p>\n<p>The senior has been a consistent force for the Gauchos over the past four years, and he will always be known as one of the better players to represent the UCSB basketball program.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/838260790360588288</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/","id":514,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[513,512,511],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Clinches No. 4 Seed in Big West Tourney With Blue-Green Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=980%2C522&ssl=1","description":"For the second consecutive year, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the UCSB women's basketball team will be playing for the Big West title.

It’s all or nothing now, the momentum we have from this game will hopefully roll over to the next.”</p>\n<p>In one of the game’s most critical moments, it was Jemerigbe’s made three-pointer with nearly six minutes left in the game that prevented a surging Cal Poly team from possibly completing a comeback.</p>\n<p>Along with Jemerigbe, both senior forward Mi’Chael Wright and senior center Melissa Maragnes were celebrated for Senior Night.</p>\n<p>Shifting the game in Santa Barbara’s advantage were runs to close the first half and open the second before Cal Poly embarked on its fourth quarter comeback, cutting the Gauchos lead to six before coming up short.</p>\n<p>It was a highly energized atmosphere inside the Thunderdome with conference tournament seeding at stake. Nonetheless, both teams traded baskets in reflection of the game’s intense pace.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead which included a basket by junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, who scored a game-high 24 points but could never establish any consistency as she shot 9-of-22 and 4-of-10 from long range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck with a balanced attack, first going to redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman in the paint, then from behind the three-point line with redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter for a 5-4 lead. It was a start that led to a 15-3 run that before Lynn Leaupepe scored five-straight points to end the quarter as Cal Poly trailed 15-12.</p>\n<p>Porter continued to warm up from deep with two three-pointers in the first to minutes of the second quarter. The Gauchos’ shooter scored eight of the team’s first 10 points.</p>\n<p>It was Porter’s most productive period as she tallied 10 of her 13 points during the period, and ended the game 4-of-7 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Yet, tying the game at 25 apiece with a three-pointer was junior guard/forward Mary Kate Evans for her only field goal off the bench.</p>\n<p>The tie wouldn’t last long once UCSB put together its 12-3 run before halftime. Half of the Gauchos points were scored at the free-throw line. Also responsible for half of the points lodged was Jemerigbe as her two made free-throws handed UCSB a 37-28 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>With momentum already going UCSB’s way, the opening minutes of the third quarter belonged solely to the Gauchos as they constructed a 16-6 run.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch began with the draining of a three-pointer by Jemerigbe to give UCSB its first double-figure lead of the game at 40-30.</p>\n<p>Helping Cal Poly chip at the Gauchos’ lead was senior forward Hannah Gilbert as she scored seven points and went a perfect 3-of-3 from the field in the quarter. Overall, Gilbert shot 50 percent (5-of-10) and ended the game with 12 points, four rebounds, one block, and one steal.</p>\n<p>But Santa Barbara’s scoring outburst proved to be too much as its bench emerged as well. The combination of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler’s drive and kick ability along with freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez’ perimeter shooting helped run up the score on UCSB’s end.</p>\n<p>The two scored six apiece, and it was Hernandez’ made three-pointer at the 4:17 mark of the third that gave UCSB a 53-34 lead as it seemed destined to route its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>Toler finished with 15 points and a game-high seven assists, while Hernandez ended with six points.</p>\n<p>Despite its 19-point deficit, Cal Poly still showed signs trying to curtail UCSB’s growing lead. Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe complemented her sister’s scoring with seven-straight points during the third quarter but it would not be enough still. Her final results to the game were 16 points and five rebounds while going 7-of-16, 2-of-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to hold the sisters to inefficient shooting nights was key in its defense holding Cal Poly to percentages of 38.5 from the field and 35 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“We held them to 40, they had 55 last time. Good heavens they’re good. There’s not much you can do with a midrange game,” Henrickson explained. “We tried to keep them on one side of the floor. [On Friday] we played some things live, which we don’t normally a lot. Every assistant had a stat. What are their numbers, percentages, zone numbers? At the end of the day, the players have got to buy in. We [had] to play the percentages and we did.”</p>\n<p>Yet, a quick 8-1 run helped the Mustangs trim UCSB’s lead to 62-49 heading into the fourth. It set the stage for their dominant start to the game’s final 10 minutes as they then went on a 9-2 run, bringing its deficit to 64-58 with 6:08 remaining following steal and made layup by Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s lead being jeaopardized, Jemerigbe prevailed with a three-pointer to give UCSB some comfort. Regaining the Gauchos’ double-figure lead of 69-58 was a made layup by Toler.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB scored one last field goal and scored the remainder of its points at the free-throw line where it finished 19-of-26.</p>\n<p>Ending the season at home and with a two-game winning streak is momentous for a Gaucho team preparing for March Madness beginning with the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Wednesday against the remaining highest seed at 8:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/","id":506,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[505,504,503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prevail For 71-53 Victory In Return Home, Can Secure No. 4 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is in the position to lock up home court after its win over UC Irvine Thursday night.

In addition to its victory, UCSB is in this position thanks to the help of UC Riverside’s loss to UC Davis in its final game of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think for the seniors, it’s always about them,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “What you want is for them to have that chance. The pride that you finished in the top four in a really good league [is significant]. At least we have a chance to control [our path].

It was the opposite for UCI as it endured its third consecutive defeat in its final road game of the season, making the Anteaters 4-25, 2-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s plan to feed forward Drew Edelman the ball in the paint was evident from the game’s beginning as she finished the game one-point shy of tying her career-high with a game-high 21 points along with tallying a career-high 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] started with a smaller lineup. Since they didn’t start with their [usual lineup], it was a much easier target for the guards to hit,” Edelman said. “They were lobbing me perfect passes, so we connected well.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored UC Irvine 24-6 in the paint and grabbed a total of 47 rebounds – its most in a conference game this season.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s dominance in the paint freed up space along the perimeter, allowing sophomore guard Coco Miller to emerge. Miller recorded 14 points as all four of her made field goals came from behind the three-point line where she shot 4-of-5.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] can’t stop everything. So if they stop the inside, [then] we have the open three,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Both Edelman and Miller ended the first half with a combined 23 points. The Gauchos’ frontcourt leader in Edelman scored the team’s first six points, which was the start to her 9-of-12 shooting night.</p>\n<p>Having entered the Thunderdome as the top three-point shooting team in the Big West, UC Irvine established its perimeter focus right away as half of its field goals in the first half (6-of-16) were made from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s first five shot attempts of the game came from long range. Knocking down the Anteaters’ first three-point attempt was sophomore guard Andee Ritter to give UCI a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Able to increase her program single-season record of made three-pointers to 81 after Thursday night, Ritter had 16 points but was couldn’t establish a shooting rhythm as she finished 5-of-18 from the field and 2-of-9 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>It was an efficient shooting start for UCSB as it shot 50 percent from the field. But the Anteaters stuck around as the two teams exchanged scores to end the first tied at 17 apiece.</p>\n<p>The trading of baskets didn’t last long as the Gauchos opened the second quarter with a 15-0 run to take a 32-17 lead.</p>\n<p>Back-to-back three-pointers by Miller and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter triggered the string of points.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos’ dominance in the paint led to UCI getting into the foul bonus nearly halfway through the second. Making 10-of-12 free-throws in during the period, UCSB had one of its best free-throw shooting nights, finishing 17-of-21.</p>\n<p>It was not until the 4:50 mark that the Anteaters scored their first field goal as a result of a made three-pointer by senior guard Irene Chavez. She then hit another shot from long distance to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 33-23.</p>\n<p>Chavez tied Ritter’s team-high 16 points but was more efficient from behind the three-point line, where she scored all 5-of-11 of her field goals.</p>\n<p>Her two shots from long distance were the Anteaters only two baskets of the quarter as they were outscored 18-6 in the quarter and trailed 35-23 at the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB pieced together a 10-3 run to open the third quarter and earned its largest lead of 19-points after a made three-pointer by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe to increase the Gauchos’ lead to 45-26. Jemerigbe seven points, six rebounds, and a game-high seven assists.</p>\n<p>Each time it seemed like UC Irvine was ruled out, it was Chavez who emerged with pivotal scoring to keep the Anteaters in the game. With 4:10 remaining in the third, Chavez started and ended UCI’s 13-6 run with three-pointers to trim its deficit to 53-42.</p>\n<p>A made jump shot by senior forward Piper McKenzie and a pair of made free-throws by senior forward Brittany Glassow brought the Gauchos’ lead to single figures as Irvine trailed 53-46. Eventually, a set of made free-throws by Ritter made UCI’s comeback attempt more plausible as it trailed by five, 56-51 with 5:11 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>But the Anteaters’ rally ended quickly once UCSB established its 15-2 run to close the game. While UCI struggled on offense with a 21.4 shooting percentage, the Gauchos prevailed from the field at 50 percent to lock up the win.</p>\n<p>After its win, only the task to win its next game lies ahead of UCSB. It will hope to secure the No. 4 seed on Saturday, March 4 against Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76185\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76185\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/","id":513,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[512,511,510],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battling For Big West Tournament Seeding","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The month of March is finally upon us, nearly guaranteeing some of the best college basketball all season.

The Gauchos have a chance to win the season series over UC Irvine in back-to-back seasons.</p>\n<p>Dating back to when the two programs first faced each other on Jan. 28, UCSB recorded a program-high 15 made three-pointers and finished with season highs in points (85), field goal percentage (55.4) and win differential (25 points), all while tying its best three-point percentage (50).</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ three-point barrage was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. She finished with career highs of 22 points and seven made three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Since setting the new record, UCSB had struggled from beyond the arc, but seems to be getting back on track as it has shot over 30 percent from deep in two of its last three games in which it has made at least seven threes.</p>\n<p>While Thursday could potentially be the game to reignite the Gauchos’ perimeter shot, it is also an opportunity for them to improve upon their ball movement and pace on offense.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara tallied a season-high 23 assists in its win over UC Irvine. The success from three-point land may have led to UCSB becoming too comfortable from deep as its sharing of the ball decreased.</p>\n<p>In four of seven games, UCSB has recorded 20-plus three-point attempts and has had less than 20 assists in all seven contests.</p>\n<p>Despite the statistics showing a decline, the Gauchos still own one of the best passing backcourts in the conference. Both point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler rank top five in total assists in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>Toler leads all players with 118, while Jemerigbe is fifth with 103. Both remain in the top five in assists per game as well with Toler in third with a 4.4 average and Jemerigbe with a 3.8 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Success from behind the three-point line is influential on both sides as UC Irvine has become one of the top long-range shooting teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off setting a program high of 15 made three pointers in their loss to Long Beach State on Saturday. Senior guard Irene Chavez and sophomore guard Andee Ritter combined for 41 points and were responsible for 12 of the team’s three-pointers. Both knocked down six trey balls, marking a career high for Chavez.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Ritter has made strides all season long as she currently leads the Big West in total threes and steals at 79 and 62, respectively. She is the only Anteater ever to make at least 70 three-pointers in a season.</p>\n<p>UCI holds a Big West-leading 38.2 three-point percentage through conference play and is second in made three pointers with 107.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the Cal Poly matchup, Saturday has the potential to be very intense as the two could be battling it out for a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be in search of repeating last season’s series sweep after defeating the Gauchos 78-67 on the conference’s opening day.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-game losing streak, Cal Poly is led by junior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who is the team’s leading scorer at 15 points per game, good for fifth in the Big West. She has tallied 20-plus points in three consecutive games and four of the Mustangs’ last five contests.</p>\n<p>Earning a season-high 29 points against UCSB earlier this season, Leaupepe will be the center of attention for the Gauchos’ defense as she has attempted a combined 48 shots in the team’s last two games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s promising start diminished as the season progressed, it still has a chance to end the season with a first-round bye for the first time since the 2010-11 season.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Irvine will be Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m. Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly on Saturday, March 4 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/","id":504,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[503,502,501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Senior Night On Happy Note After Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=873%2C585&ssl=1","description":"With point guard Eric Childress as the only senior on the team, it was evident that Gauchos played with their hearts on their sleeves as they reigned victorious in their final home game.

After a brief ceremony celebrating UCSB’s sole senior, the game got off to a quick start with Highlander junior forward Alex Larsson scoring in the first 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>At 6’10”, Larsson barely had to jump to get the ball in the basket. Although both teams racked up points quickly, raising the score to 20-11 UCSB by 12:30, the Gauchos did a great job of keeping a tight defense. By preventing UCR from driving, UCSB defense was able to keep their score down, but was having trouble guarding the outside three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This night was a celebration of Childress, and whether it was the team’s energy or the fact that it was going to be his last game at the Thunderdome, he was on a roll. Scoring a total of 21 points, he went 4-4 on his first four three pointers and ended up 5-8 overall on threes.</p>\n<p>“You have to work as hard as you can because time flies by and it’s not going to wait for you,” Childress said.</p>\n<p>With Childress on fire and Gaucho defense looking strong, the only slight improvement possible was getting more shots off. The UCSB team was on the same page, had great ball movement and knew where everyone was on the court.</p>\n<p>One effective Highlander tactic utilized throughout the entire game was a hard press. With the Gaucho point guard and one or two other players covered and searching for an open pass, UCR efficiently ran down the UCSB shot clock, giving the Gaucho offense only around 15 seconds to shoot rather than the usual 30.</p>\n<p>UCR senior forward Secean Johnson did not have as great of a half as spectators might have expected. Only putting two points on the board, he was all over the court and takings sloppy shots during the first half, but found his stride in the second period.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played the first half guns blazing, leading by up to 12 multiple times. For the majority of the half UCSB was able to hold onto a 10-point lead.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore forward Jarriesse Blackmon had a great game, both defensively and offensively, even scoring on two separate occasions exactly as the shot clock ran out, sending the crowd into a frenzy both times.</p>\n<p>With two minutes left in the first period, UCR stepped up and managed to bring the score within one point, Gauchos leading 32-31.</p>\n<p>At the half, Gaucho shooting was at a season high with a 54.5 field goal percentage. 15 of 31 Highlander points were from their bench while on the UCSB side of the court, 15 points alone were from star senior Childress, who had made 5-6 three pointers.</p>\n<p>Although he came away with three personal fouls, freshman guard Christian Terrell was an essential asset to the Gaucho victory, not only scoring but also defending.</p>\n<p>“Terrell’s defense made a real difference for us,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the first half, we did not play anywhere near as well when he was off the floor.”</p>\n<p>Rebounds were bountiful for the Gauchos this game, all players doing a great job of not only getting a first hand on the ball but keeping possession and working as a team to move it up the court. Junior forward Alex Hart was all hands, grabbing an impressive 15 boards this game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman guards Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell made big runs. Both had the ability to work from either side of the court and shoot from outside. Powell specifically had a great night, especially after a foul that resulted in Highlander points. He turned up the energy and even made a glorious shot from a couple feet outside of the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“In practice, I’ve been working on catching and shooting,” Powell said. “My primary game is getting the ball to the basket.”</p>\n<p>Despite Highlander efforts to catch up to the Gauchos, UCSB was able to keep their lead until the very end. Winning 68-61, the game ended in style with a flying dunk from Terrell.</p>\n<p>The best part of the night was the last minute of the game. Starting with a few fans in the student section and quickly spreading to the entire events center, an “Eric Childress” chant began and continued until the end of the game, with all Gaucho supports on their feet.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great Gaucho performance and a fantastic senior night for Childress. The Gauchos will next face Cal State Fullerton on the road on Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76030\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76030\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/","id":493,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[492,491,490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Loss to UC Davis Results In Third-Straight Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-28-at-12.55.39-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-28-at-12.55.39-PM.png?resize=843%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the battle for seeding in the Big West Tournament becoming more intense, the UCSB women's basketball team is on the verge of descending once again after experiencing its third consecutive loss on...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team, which was in position to secure first place just over a month ago, continues to falter in its quest to secure a top seed in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76011\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76011\" data-attachment-id=\"76011\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/onome-jemerigbe-brings-the-ball-up-the-court-jenny-luo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBBallvs.Northridge_02092017_JennyLuo-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Onome Jemerigbe brings the ball up the court.

UCSB’s continuous slump lands it at fifth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>The likelihood of UC Davis locking up the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament increased over the weekend as it earned its eighth-straight victory to improve to 21-6, 12-2. Able to sustain its first-place rank in the conference, the Aggies’ streak is their longest since winning nine consecutive games during the 2005-06 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its matchup versus UCSB, UC Davis had shot 50 percent or above from the field in its last two games. The Aggies’ hot shooting continued against the Gauchos as they ended the game a shade below the aforementioned mark at 49 percent on 25-of-51 shooting, but they made up for it from beyond the arc, making 10-of-20, a major contrast to their 2-of-16 finish in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman recorded her sixth double-double of the season as she led the Gauchos in scoring with 17 points and a game-high 10 rebounds. She finished 5-of-8 from the field and 7-of-7 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Two leads as the teams traded baskets in the opening minutes were UCSB’s only leads during the game.</p>\n<p>Trailing 4-5, UC Davis made an 8-0 run that kickstarted the Aggies, who extended their lead as the game progressed.</p>\n<p>Igniting the scoring stretch was sophomore guard Kourtney Eaton with a midrange jump shot. Never losing its lead after the field goal, UC Davis added to its lead with back-to-back made three-pointers by junior forward Pele Gianotti and junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh on its next two possessions to take a 11-4 lead.</p>\n<p>Gianotti concluded Saturday with a game-high 19 points, going 6-of-12 from the field, 3-of-7 from long range and 4-of-4 at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>A quick layup by Edelman helped UCSB trim Davis’s lead to 13-7 at the end of the period.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting just 34.8 percent from behind the perimeter (8-of-23), it was an improved shooting performance for the Gauchos, as it was their most made three-pointers since creating a new program record on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Coco Miller knocked down more than half of UCSB’s three-pointers, scoring the Gauchos’ first two field goals in the second quarter from downtown to cut their deficit to 13-18. Scoring each of her field goals from deep, Miller tallied 15 points on 5-of-12 and 5-of-9 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>After tying her career high of 27 points in the first game against UCSB, it was expected that redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch would be the Gauchos’ main concern.</p>\n<p>Both Miller and Bertsch played pivotal roles in the second quarter; it was the game’s highest scoring period, with UC Davis taking a 26-21 advantage.</p>\n<p>Miller scored 12 of her 15 points in the period on 4-of-6 shooting, while Bertsch scored 11 points and missed just one shot attempt as she went 5-of-6.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara held the potential Big West Player of the Year to 15 points, Bertsch was efficient with her shot selection as she finished the game 7-of-13 from the field. Her seven-straight points beginning at the 7:36 mark of the second period captured UC Davis’s first double-figure lead of the game at 25-13.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to come within a nine-point deficit after a made three-pointer by Miller, trailing 30-21, but could not contain the Aggies’ streaky shooting of 76.9 percent and entered halftime down 39-27.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the second half, yet it was their worst shooting quarter; they shot a horrid 18.8 percent from the field (3-of-16) and went 0-of-7 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB once again trimmed UCD’s lead to nine points at 33-42 after a pair of made free throws by Edelman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ comeback efforts were halted as UC Davis embarked on a 10-2 run to close out the third with its largest lead of the game, 52-35.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, UCSB performed best during the fourth quarter, outscoring the Aggies 26-18. It recorded a 56.3 field goal percentage and shot 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>While Edelman padded her stats with eight points in the quarter, redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler was vital during the Gauchos’ late spurt, scoring nine of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>All nine points occurred in the game’s final three minutes, during which at one point she trimmed UC Davis’ lead to 63-56 with 1:36 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies’ clutch free-throw shooting — making 10-of-12 — led to them securing their victory in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home for its final two games of the season. It will face UC Irvine and Blue-Green rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/","id":492,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[491,490,489],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Looking to Capitalize on Upset Opportunity, Face BW Leader UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-25-at-1.07.49-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-25-at-1.07.49-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing the situation of seeking a much needed victory, the UCSB women’s basketball team is looking to overcome its 1-4 standing in its last five games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The regular season is nearing its end as there are just three games remaining on the UCSB women’s basketball team’s Big West schedule.  Upon entering March, Santa Barbara is in need of a win as it has descended within the conference standings each week and has lost four of its last five contests.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in its final road game of the season, which will be the last of four away games in a row.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75894\" style=\"width: 367px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75894\" data-attachment-id=\"75894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/drea-toler-shoots-a-layup-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drea Toler shoots a layup.

If UCD manages to win its seventh straight, it would tie the longest streak in the program’s Division I history set back in both 2008 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The path to upsetting the Aggies will begin with the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball. UCSB is coming off a season-high 26 turnovers in its loss to Long Beach State, in which it was outscored 35-13 in points off turnovers. It was the sixth time this season the Gauchos turned the ball over 20-plus times, but the first since Dec. 19 in their win over Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p>While the defensive pressure of opposing teams must be accredited, oftentimes UCSB’s turnover troubles result from self-inflicted mistakes such as forcing passes in the lane and paint that result in steals, wasted possessions that go out of bounds or the mishandling of passes.</p>\n<p>During the team’s 1-4 standing in its last five games, UCSB has continuously struggled with its three-point shooting. Over the span of games, Santa Barbara has accumulated a 21.4 average from behind three-point line, finishing with an 11.8 percentage in its last game after a 2-for-17 finish from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could use an improved three-point shooting performance from redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting a Big West fifth-best 39.2 percent from three-point land and having the third-most made three-pointers in the conference at 56, Porter has only shown glimpses of her once consistent long range shooting.</p>\n<p>She began the Gauchos’ five game slide with a disturbing zero points and 0-of-8 shooting outing and hasn’t been able to make much progress since. Currently shooting 25.6 percent from behind the perimeter, Porter has only managed to achieve double figures in scoring twice, and she is coming off her second-lowest career total of two points.</p>\n<p>Still, the team’s go-to scorer remains a primary option as her 56 made three-pointers are tied for sixth-most in a single season in UCSB women’s basketball history. If Porter can manage to get the three ball to fall, it could be very beneficial as the Gauchos are 6-1 during conference play when she makes three or more three-point baskets.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to capitalize upon any scoring opportunity it can get as it prepares to face arguably the most dynamic team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UC Davis, who last won a Big West title in 2011, has made itself one of the conference’s few teams favored to lock up the No. 1 seed and possibly win the Big West Tournament. Another win could have major implications as the 2010-11 season also was UCD’s last 20-win season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies lead in just about every imaginable statistical category with outstanding averages in points per game (69.8), points allowed per game (60), field goal percentage (44.3), three-point percentage (35.3), defensive three-point percentage (27.5), defensive field goal percentage (35.3), turnovers committed per game (13.6) and assists per game (16.8).</p>\n<p>Davis is one of three Big West teams this season to hand UCSB its largest deficit in a loss of 14 points. The two teams last met on Feb. 4 when redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch tied her career-high of 27 points to lead the Aggies to a 62-48 victory.</p>\n<p>Bertsch currently ranks third in points per game and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.7 and 52.7, respectively. Three of her eight 20-point games this season have occurred in the Aggies’ past four games.</p>\n<p>As the team’s top scorer, Bertsch is able to score in the paint and stretch the floor with her midrange shooting, benefiting from behind the perimeter is the junior duo of forwards Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh.</p>\n<p>The pair of long range sharpshooters complete Davis’ trio of double figure scorers with Nafekh averaging 11.3 PPG and Gianotti at 10.6 PPG. Both are within the top five in the Big West in three-point percentage, as Nafekh sits atop the conference at 46.5 percent while Gianotti is sixth at 38.5 percent.</p>\n<p>UCSB held UC Davis to a 12.5 three-point percentage earlier in the month on 2-of-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Upsetting the Aggies at home will be a difficult task as they have won 14 of their last 17 home games. Most notably, they have not trailed in a game since the second quarter of their win over Cal State Fullerton back on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Despite facing arguably the best team in the Big West, UCSB must focus on its defensive approach as that will help it produce on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip off at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25 at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75914\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75914\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/","id":251,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[250,249,248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Men’s Basketball Looking to Hold On to Slim Postseason Chance Entering Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently at the bottom of the Big West standings, the UCSB men's basketball team is on its last leg of hope to grab the eighth seed in the Big West tournament.

Not only has he scored the brunt of the Gaucho baskets since Vincent has been out, but he has played with a noticeable energy and fierceness to the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In his most recent game against Long Beach State, he only put seven on the board, but before that he scored 16 points in the victory against Hawaii last Thursday and has been an essential asset to the team, starting the last five games averaging 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite only scoring four points, Gaucho freshman guard Christian Terrell had a solid game against LBSU as he tied his career-high grabbing nine rebounds. Although Terrell has had some hesitation in the past when it comes to taking the shot, he has started in six conference games so far and continues to improve.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Highlanders’ field goal percentage is 42.1 while the Gauchos are barely hanging onto their 37.1, a league-worst mark. An unfortunate recurring theme for the UCSB team is their inability to shoot with accuracy. The trouble is not getting to the basket but getting the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hart and team leader senior guard Eric Childress, freshman guard Max Heidegger is an explosive player that drives hard and puts points on the board, yet with so many top players unable to participate, the Gauchos are suffering as clearly demonstrated in their record.</p>\n<p>One area that Santa Barbara does excel in, at least ever so slightly better than UCR, is rebounding. The Gauchos are averaging 36.6 per game compared to the Highlanders’ 34.8, showcasing how they are getting in there and grabbing the ball off both offensive and defensive glass.</p>\n<p>UCR has a fantastic free throw percentage of nearly 73 percent on the season compared to the Gaucho percentage of 64 percent. In their most recent game, UCSB had 17 personal fouls called on them; against a team as accurate as Riverside, the Gauchos will have to play smart and not commit as many fouls, especially on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>For Childress, Thursday will obviously be an emotional night as it will be his final game wearing a Gaucho uniform in the Thunderdome. The senior will look to cap off his home career in the right way improving upon his team-high 8.5 points per game, 3.5 assists per game and 2.2 steals per game, also a Big West best.</p>\n<p>The co-captain of the team alongside Vincent, Childress has played on some great Gaucho teams, and although this wasn’t the ending he expected, a win could mitigate some of the damage done to his senior season.</p>\n<p>As the season winds to a close, all teams are trying to bring in as many wins as possible heading into the Big West tournament. As this will be each team’s second to last game, expect both teams to bring all they have got to the court.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gaucho and UCR Highlander game will take place this Thursday, Feb. 23, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/","id":248,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[247,246,245],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Begin 3-Game Home Stand, Host Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on an eight-game losing streak, the UCSB men's basketball team is hoping that a return to the Thunderdome will lead it to overcoming its winning drought.

With Vincent still out due to a torn ACL, all other Gaucho shooters will need to be at their best.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warrior to watch out for in this game will absolutely be senior Noah Allen. In the last Hawaii-Santa Barbara matchup, the California native managed to put 34 points on the board in 34 minutes of playing time. Allen currently ranks fifth in the Big West in PPG averaging 15 a game.</p>\n<p>Before becoming a star player at Hawaii, the senior guard played three seasons as a UCLA Bruin and was part of two NCAA Sweet Sixteen teams. Since transferring, Allen has scored 359 points this year and has a field goal percentage of 46.7 percent.</p>\n<p>Other strong starters include junior forward Gibson Johnson and sophomore forward Jack Purchase who average 10.9 and 10.1 points per game respectively. With Johnson, Purchase and Allen all towering at 6’7” and above, it will be essential for the Gauchos to get back and closely protect the basket.</p>\n<p>Despite losing their most recent match-up, the Rainbow Wahine have still put forth a solid campaign thus far. Defeating UCSB would create a nice cushion for the ’Bows as they and the Long Beach State 49ers both hold 6-5 conference records. A Santa Barbara upset would be greatly applauded although it is unlikely considering the Gauchos shooting woes.</p>\n<p>All season, UCSB has had extreme trouble with shooting accuracy. They are able to get to the basket and get clean shots off, but they are not being completed, leaving the team with a 35.9 field goal percentage in conference play, a league worst.</p>\n<p>Four out of the Gauchos’ last six opponents have scored at least 78 points, so the fact that Santa Barbara is only averaging 57.3 points per game is problematic and is going to be a real setback, especially when facing Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently in a rut, having lost eight in a row and only breaking the 60-point mark once in the last seven games. It will be good to have the boys playing at home again as all three of their wins have happened at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Along with Heidegger, junior forward Alex Hart and senior guard Eric Childress have been holding down the fort for the Gauchos. Since recuperating from the flu bug, which he caught on the trip to Hawaii, Hart has been playing his best ball, averaging 13 points in his last three games while also scoring a career-high 16 points against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Childress, the team’s only senior, has also been great despite not having that special senior finish he was expecting. In his last outing at CSUN, the point guard went off for 16 points and, with a chance to end his senior year on a high note, expects to continue producing at a high level.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos have an opportunity to get a win at home, and as there are fewer and fewer games left in the 2016-2017 season, a home victory is exactly what the team needs. Head to the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m. to cheer on the Gauchos as they take on the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75747\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75747\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/","id":472,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[471,470,469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Road Voyage Continues, Face UCR and LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=978%2C608&ssl=1","description":"After picking up a win in the first game of its four-game road trip, the UCSB women's basketball team will remain on the road this Thursday and Saturday.

UCSB is seeking its first win against UCR since the Jan. 23 of the 2013-14 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to Saturday’s victory, redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman had just one double-figure scoring performance in UCSB’s last five games. In addition to the one game, in which she had 14 points, she had recorded no more than six field goal attempts.</p>\n<p>When Edelman has at least 10 or more shot attempts in a game, the Gauchos are 6-1. She is coming off posting career-high in points and assists with 22 and three, respectively, while she added seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>As UCSB’s primary option in its frontcourt, Edelman held her ground in the team’s first meeting with 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting, eight rebounds, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Signs of the Gauchos deciding to get Edelman more involved is important as her ability to draw the defense into the paint can be beneficial in freeing up the perimeter, especially as Santa Barbara has struggled from long range as of recently.</p>\n<p>Since recording a program-high 15 made three-pointers against UC Irvine on Jan. 28, UCSB has been unable to shake its inefficient shooting from beyond the arc. In four-straight games, it has recorded a three-point percentage of 30 percent or lower.</p>\n<p>While the three-point shot has gradually diminished, also complementing Edelman’s play in the paint has been redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Whether if she uses her dazzling speed to drive to the hoop or dish out the ball, Toler has been UCSB’s most consistent player for nearly the past month.</p>\n<p>In seven of the team’s last eight games, the Gauchos’ top bench player has scored at least 12 points and is the team’s leading scorer through conference play at 11.4 points per game. Her vision to get the ball into passing lanes and shooter on the perimeter is evident as well as she is third in the Big West in assists per game, averaging 4.2.</p>\n<p>Prepared to face the Highlanders, who are second in the Big West in both team field goal percentage and assists per game at 41 percent and 16.5 dimes per game. Their assists per contest average ranks 32<sup>nd in</sup> the nation.</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders is senior forward Réjane Vérin. Despite playing down in the paint, Vérin is an all-around playmaker as she averages 4.1 assists per game, tied for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Coming off back-to-back 20-point games, UCR’s leader enters this week’s slate of games as the Big West’s No. 1 scorer at 17.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Both Edelman and Vérin had 15 points each when the two teams faced each other earlier this season. Edelman ended that game 4-of-4 from the field, but the perfect shooting performance would not be enough in 37 minutes of play. The anticipated battle between the two will be something to keep an eye on as they hope to maintain momentum.</p>\n<p>Following their trip to Riverside, the Gauchos are also seeking to sweep Long Beach State Saturday night.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be hoping to replicate its stout defense from its first game against LBSU in which it held the 49ers to a 23.8 three-point percentage on 5-of-21 shooting from beyond arc.</p>\n<p>This will be a difficult task as Long Beach State is coming off tying its single-game program record of 20 made three-pointers in its blowout win over Cal State Fullerton last weekend. The 49ers set a program and conference record with their 45 three-point attempts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State is tied for both 22<sup>nd</sup> in three-point field goals made and 25<sup>th</sup> in three-point field goals per game in the nation at 203 and an 8.1 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Most notably, LBSU forced 23 turnovers to gain a 29-7 advantage in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>Hoping to contain a 49er team looking for its third-straight win, UCSB not only must ensure that it properly defends the perimeter, but also must capitalize from long range as points in the paint alone may not be enough to defeat LBSU.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Riverside is Thursday, Feb. 16 at 5 p.m. The Gauchos will play Long Beach State Saturday, Feb. 18 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/","id":488,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[487,486,485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Tied For Third After Earning Season Sweep of Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=978%2C608&ssl=1","description":"Back on the winning track to end a two-game losing streak, the UCSB women's basketball team had a great shooting performance in its road win at Hawaii.

Santa Barbara is currently tied with UC Riverside for third place in the league standings. Hawaii lost its fourth-straight game, and is now 8-15 and 4-7 in conference play for seventh place.</p>\n<p>In what was just her second career 20-point game, Edelman got off to a quick start, scoring four of the Gauchos’ six points to begin the game.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 30 percent or below – 28.6 percent on a 4-of-14 finish – form behind the three-point line for the fourth consecutive game, redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter began the first period hot from long range.</p>\n<p>Porter went a perfect 3-of-3 shooting in the first quarter. Her three makes from beyond the arc were her only field goals for the night as she ended the game with nine points on 3-of-10 overall, 3-of-7 three-point shooting. Her three-point make with 29 second remaining in the period gave UCSB a 20-12 lead.</p>\n<p>Both junior guard Sarah Toeaina and freshman forward Keleah-Aiko Koloi managed to keep Hawaii within close distance of UCSB’s lead with four points apiece.</p>\n<p>Just like Hawaii’s first meeting against the Gauchos, Toeaina led the Rainbow Wahine in scoring again with 19 points on a 8-of-15 performance from the field. Koloi concluded the game without a miss, going 3-of-3 shooting and for six points in eight minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos first double-figure lead of 22-12 occurred as a result of a made layup by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in the first minute of the second quarter. Jemerigbe had a competent night with 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting along with three steals.</p>\n<p>Two quick three-point makes by freshman guard Julissa Tago and sophomore forward Leah Salanoa cut the Gauchos’ lead to 25-18.</p>\n<p>Each time Hawaii managed to score a basket, UCSB responded with points of its own to maintain a lead. Most notably, UCSB held the Rainbow Wahine to just nine points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Following a 30 second timeout, the Gauchos completely controlled the final five minutes of the period to enter halftime on a 9-1 run. Beginning with a made jumpshot by Jemerigbe, at the core of Santa Barbara’s run was junior forward Chaya Durr with four points. Durr ended the game with six points, five rebounds, and one steal as she helped UCSB enter halftime with a 36-21 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the large deficit, Hawaii was a different team coming into the second half. The Rainbow Wahine replied to the Gauchos’ closing run with a 12-3 run in the opening minutes of the third, forcing UCSB to call a timeout as its lead was trimmed to 39-31.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii outscored UCSB 18-13 in the period, leading the team’s comeback was Toeaina, scoring 10 of her 19 points. Her efficient shot selection of driving to the basket for layups in addition to her mid-range shooting allowed Hawaii to come within its closest deficit of the game at 41-37.</p>\n<p>But, the Rainbow Wahine defense could not stop the steady shooting of UCSB, who earned a 10-point lead 49-39 to end the quarter after a made three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Unable to disrupt UCSB’s rhythmic shooting night, Hawaii never overcame its double-figure deficit.</p>\n<p>Guiding the Gauchos to their fourth road win of the season was the fourth quarter play of both Edelman and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>The two combined for 14 points in the last 10 minutes of regulation. After a quiet first three quarters, scoring just four points, Toler’s 3-of-3 shooting in the fourth was essential to UCSB closing the game.</p>\n<p>Playing all 10 minutes of the period, the elusive guard was responsible for all eight of the Gauchos’ points in the final 2 and a half minutes of the game. She was effective in both penetrating and finishing at the rim as well as at the free-throw line where she went 4-of-6 on the night.</p>\n<p>Toler led all bench players in scoring with 12 points as she went 4-of-6 from the field, helping UCSB lock up its victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road leg of games, resuming play this Thursday, Feb. 16 at UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75680\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75680\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/","id":471,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[470,469,468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":16,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
