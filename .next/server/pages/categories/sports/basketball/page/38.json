One of the teams the Gauchos are tied with is in fact Cal Poly, which holds an equal 7-4 league and 13-9 overall mark.</p>\n<p>“I think at this time of year, every game is equal in importance,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Now, we have a team that beat us pretty handily at their place, so if anything, it’s the pride thing and again, you want to win on your home court.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara will enter with momentum, having won its last three games and five of its last six. Last weekend, UCSB came away with two road wins up north, defeating UC Davis 60-52 before upsetting Pacific 52-47.</p>\n<p>Down 14 three minutes into the second half, the Gauchos used balanced offense, featuring three players in double figures, as well as its typical tenacious defense to hold the Tigers to nearly 25 points below their average and overcome the top team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep doing what we’re doing,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “Obviously we’re doing something right, but we’re still humble. We’re not getting too excited and losing our focus.”</p>\n<p>After the pair of victories, Underwood was named the Big West Player of the Week for the fourth time this season. She averaged a double-double in the road wins with 14.5 points and 14 rebounds, including a career-high 16 rebounds against Pacific.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about me; it’s a team thing,” Underwood said. “I think when we have individual awards, it’s a reflection of our team and our coaching staff and the hard work and effort we’ve put in as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB holds an incredible 7-4 record away from home, Santa Barbara will have to find a way to win in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are only 3-6 at home, but will have the opportunity to put back-to-back home wins together for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s been the million dollar question with this team,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We have to bring a lot of energy because when we go into away gyms, that’s already manifested itself. Of course, [the energy is] going against us and for some reason, we like that. But, I think it’s going to be fun playing in our house and it’s a big rivalry game, so it’ll be a fun Saturday.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s last game against Cal Poly wasn’t fun for the Gauchos. A weak outing for Santa Barbara resulted in a 66-47 loss in San Luis Obispo. UCSB was unable to stop the Mustangs’ strong offense in the second half, giving up 38 second-half points and allowing them to shoot 56.7 percent from the field. The loss was the Gauchos’ third straight to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I definitely [think there’s a revenge factor],” Nesbit said. “Looking back on the film and watching our offensive execution, their transition offense and our transition defense, it was just horrendous. So, I think we’re excited because we know we’re a lot better than we were then.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Molly Schlemer and senior guard Kayla Griffin were especially on fire, combining for 43 points and nearly outscoring UCSB on their own. At 6’5’’, Schlemer was a problem in the post for UCSB while Griffin was 3-4 from three-point range and tallied nine rebounds, five assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“I think we took a lot of switches that last game and they exploited some of our smaller guards on Griffin in the low post area and then we also had some miscommunication in transition,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, our transition defense has to be a lot better and in the half court, we’ll try to mix things up against Schlemer. But when you don’t have 6’3’’ or 6’4’’ to guard her, you’re pretty limited on what player you decide to put on her.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s solid offensive performance against the Gauchos wasn’t a fluke either. The Mustangs rank second in the Big West in scoring offense at 68.6 points per game and lead the league in field goal percentage at 40.9 percent.</p>\n<p>“They’re a potent team,” Mitchell said. “They know that they can match you, so they’re willing to give up a basket and then get it out and they’re off to a track meet. We can’t let it become a track meet because that’s not what we do well.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key this week for the Gauchos will be defense, especially in transition. As the top defensive team in the Big West, holding teams to an average of 53.5 points per game, Santa Barbara is 10-5 when keeping teams less than 60 points and just 1-7 when its opponents break the 60-point mark.</p>\n<p>Despite being a Blue-Green Rivalry game, UCSB will be sporting pink gear at it plays in its annual Play 4Kay game to raise breast cancer awareness. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-blue-green-rivalry-game/","id":676,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[675,674,673],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Snap Skid, Overpower Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With their backs against the wall, the UCSB men’s basketball team came out Saturday night with a clear sense of urgency.

Taylor hit his first two three-pointers and sophomore center Alan Williams added six quick points to give UCSB a 12-0 lead to start the game. That run was put in danger, however, when Williams sprained his right ankle midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>“We stick in there with each other,” Taylor said. “We were going to get that win no matter what tonight. We had to stick together and stay strong and compete, and we did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB responded without its best player, turning a four-point advantage at the point of Big Al’s departure into a 37-29 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Big Al recorded 10 points and seven rebounds in a mere eight minutes on the night, providing UCSB with solid play in the first half. Williams missed three games due to a hamstring injury and was playing in only his third game back on Saturday before suffering another injury.</p>\n<p>“I thought we started this game with pretty good fight,” Coach Williams said. “I’m disappointed to see [Big Al] go out. I think he was going to have a big game, he looked very active.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing without Big Al, Santa Barbara continued to show its resilient energy in the second half. The Gauchos are down to eight players now without Williams and an assortment of other injured Gauchos.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson led the Gauchos in scoring with 13 points apiece. Brown pulled down a team-high eight rebounds, while Bryson grabbed six boards on the night.</p>\n<p>“We played more as a team tonight,” Brown said. “We got some good vibes going and some positive energy and that’s really what we need right now. We just started off hot right away. It was a good feeling. We just kept pushing the whole night.”</p>\n<p>The story of the night for the Gauchos was their hot shooting, as they shot 50 percent on both field goals and three-pointers. Junior guard Kyle Boswell scored nine points on the night while finishing 3-3 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“We hit some shots, we played with a great sense of urgency, we had some good energy; I thought they pulled for each other pretty hard tonight,” Coach Williams said. “That’s something as a young group, sometimes you just start playing instead of playing with a purpose. I thought we had a little better purpose [tonight].”</p>\n<p>Taylor provided the Gauchos with solid play at the point on the night, registering a career-high tying 11 points along with eight assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Ross Rivera led Pacific with 15 points on the night and was one of only two Tigers to register double-digit scoring along with senior guard Lorenzo McCloud who had 10 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s big, we needed a win.

UCSB now stands at 11-12 overall and 7-4 in conference while the Tigers lost their second-straight game, dropping to 8-3 in league and 18-5 overall.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud — coming back from the deficit,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We made the right decisions and we made big stops. As a coach, you just have to smile because it’s starting to come together.”</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the Gauchos won the game on the defensive end. UCSB held Pacific, which leads the Big West in scoring at 71.5 points per game, to 24.5 points below its average.</p>\n<p>“[Defense is] our team identity,” Underwood said. “People were at the right places at the right time, we had good rotation, help side was there, and we took a couple charges.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also limited the Tiger’s three point shooting, allowing them to shoot just 21.7 percent from behind the arc, a much lower percentage than their leage-leading 34.7 percent average.</p>\n<p>“What we did is we had four players in the lane and one player on the ball,” Mitchell said. “That was our strategy, to clog the lanes because last time it was a layup drill on us and we didn’t want to go down that way today.”</p>\n<p>Down 10 halfway through the second half, junior guard Melissa Zornig converted a layup that sparked a 16-2 run that gave the Gauchos a 46-42 lead with 2:36 remaining.</p>\n<p>“Our kids just started playing with a lot of confidence,” Mitchell said. “I think once they adjusted to the tempo of the game, we settled in. Sometimes when you’re backed into a corner, you come out fighting and that’s what we did in the second half.”</p>\n<p>However, the very next play, UCSB gave up two offensive rebounds, resulting in a put-back by senior forward Ashley Smith. Then, senior forward Kendall Rodriguez buried a three to regain a one-point lead for Pacific.</p>\n<p>Down a point with just under a minute left and in need of a basket, senior center Kirsten Tilleman received the ball on the wing and fed the ball in to Underwood, who went up for the short jump shot and was fouled. Underwood knocked down both free throws to give UCSB a 48-47 lead.</p>\n<p>“That was an [isolation play],” Underwood said. “We were trying to get to the rim, finish or get a foul. They ended up fouling me, so that was awesome.”</p>\n<p>With their tenacious ‘D,’ the Gauchos earned a stop on the opposite end, forcing Pacific to foul junior guard Nicole Nesbit with 18 seconds left on the game clock. UCSB’s best free-throw shooter stepped up to the line and calmly sank both free throws to give UCSB a 50-47 advantage.</p>\n<p>With one offensive possession remaining for the Tigers, the Big West’s best offensive team was set to take on the conference’s best defensive squad. Rodriguez lined up a triple but Tilleman swatted the shot away, forcing Pacific to throw up a long fade away three.</p>\n<p>“During that last timeout, we had seen that play (during the film of the Cal Poly vs. Pacific game) and we knew they were going to go to it,” Mitchell said. “We handled the ball side of the three for [senior guard Erica McKenzie] and we had players that made plays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara secured the rebound and Nesbit was able to clinch the game at the free throw line. Overall, the Gauchos shot 94.1 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB found its stride in the second half, outshooting Pacific 40 percent to 31 percent. In addition, after 10 first half turnovers, Santa Barbara gave the ball away just three times in the second half.</p>\n<p>The offense was balanced, too, as the Gauchos featured three players in double-figures. Zornig led all scorers with 18 points including 3-5 from behind the arc, while Nesbit scored 13 points, 11 coming in the second half. Underwood tallied her ninth double-double of the season with 14 points, 10 of which came in the second half, and a career-high 16 rebounds. Finally, Tilleman added six points, eight rebounds, two blocks and a career-high tying four steals.</p>\n<p>“We definitely came in here as the underdog, expected to lose and we came in here fired up and ready to win,” Zornig said.</p>\n<p>To begin the game, UCSB struggled offensively, missing its first seven shots. Shooting just 23.1 percent, it looked as if there was a cover on the rim and the Gauchos quickly fell into a 24-11 hole. Nevertheless, Santa Barbara ended the half on a 7-2 run to go into the locker room down just single digits, 26-18.</p>\n<p>“It was really frustrating because we’re getting open looks, but we couldn’t hit any shots,” Zornig said. “We just had to stay confident. We knew we were going to hit shots in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Zornig single-handedly kept UCSB in the game during the first half, scoring 10 of the team’s 18 first half total.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] has a knack for scoring,” Mitchell said. “She has great moves around the basket and we all know she can knock it down.”</p>\n<p>Pacific was relentless to open the second half though, going on a 7-1 run in the first three minutes of play. However, the Gauchos stole the momentum and would eventually outscore the Tigers 34-21 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We had some huge stops at the end,” Zornig said. “Our shot was off at the beginning of the game, but we found a way to knock down some shots at some critical moments.”</p>\n<p>After two games up on the road, UCSB returns home for a three-game home stand beginning next Saturday against Cal Poly for the Play for Kay game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/","id":671,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[670,669,668],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Back to Winning Ways","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All season long, the UCSB women’s basketball team has said its defense fuels its offense.

Any time you win on the road, you have to be satisfied with that even though we know it wasn’t a pretty 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB took advantage from the high post, breaking down Davis’ trapping defense. Senior forward Sweets Underwood and senior guard Angelei Aguirre both played the elbow spot, combining for 27 points.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of our hits were in the high post and that’s something that we really worked on — that high-post shot, whether it was high low or short corner — the ball has to go in and out and I think we did an awesome job rotating the ball in and out,” Underwood said. “That’s how Lei and I were able to get some open looks.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game hot on the offensive end, using 66.7 percent shooting to put together a 13-4 run and take an early 23-12 lead.</p>\n<p>“I think we just executed offensively, which got us open shots,” Aguirre said. “We were able to take our time and knock them down.”</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies returned the favor as they went on an 8-0 run of their own to get within three points. That’s when UCSB picked up its defense, which sparked a 6-0 run as the Gauchos finished the half with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Playing well from the opening tip has been a crucial key for Santa Barbara as the team is now 9-1 when leading at the half.</p>\n<p>“You always want to go into halftime feeling good about yourselves and then come out with even more energy, so that first half lead was very critical for us,” Underwood said.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, sophomore forward Sydnee Fipps found her stride offensively, scoring 10 of the Aggies first 14 points of the half to get her team back in the game. Fipps finished with a game-high 16 points.</p>\n<p>“[Fipps is] a great player,” Mitchell said. “She has an attack mentality and we have to do a better job of guarding off the dribble.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also suffered from a six-minute scoring drought in the middle of the second half, caused by unforced turnovers, allowing the Aggies to go on a 9-2 run and close the gap to one point at 44-43. On the night, UCSB turned the ball over 22 times compared to 16 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We made a lot of critical mistakes offensively, turning the ball over, when we didn’t need to,” Underwood said. “They executed off of our turnovers, so it was us beating up on ourselves.”</p>\n<p>The game remained close throughout the rest of the half and Davis once again cut the lead to one with 2:58 remaining.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB persevered. Senior center Kirsten Tilleman knocked down two free throws to make the score 54-51 with just over a minute to go. Out of a timeout, Davis managed to get off a three-point shot, but UCSB was able to earn the stop, allowing junior guard Nicole Nesbit to ice the game at the free throw line hitting both attempts.</p>\n<p>“We just focused on defense,” Aguirre said. “They’re a systems team, so we knew what they’re running, and so we just had to focus and not make any mental mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara outrebounded the Aggies 34-24 and outshot Davis 47.8 percent to 34.7 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had extremely balanced scoring on the night as well with three players finishing in double figures. Nesbit tallied 13 points and five assists on the night while Aguirre contributed 12 points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>Underwood led the Gauchos with 15 points and 12 rebounds for her eighth double-double of the season. Finally, Tilleman posted a solid night, finishing with eight points and seven boards, and junior guard Melissa Zornig scored eight points, including two critical threes down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“I was proud of our team that we were able to buckle down and win a close game and be able to execute and hit shots and most importantly, get stops when it counted,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its road trip north against Big West leader Pacific this Saturday.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/","id":669,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[668,667,666],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cold Gauchos Fall to Sharpshooting Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The shots weren’t falling for the UCSB men’s basketball team last night as the Gauchos dropped a 64-56 game to UC Davis that extended Santa Barbara’s season long losing streak to five games.

Overall, UCSB shot 34.9 percent from the field last night.</p>\n<p>“We got good shots up there, they just weren’t falling tonight,” freshman guard Michael Bryson said. “There were times when people were right open and not able to knock it down. We’re going to have bad shooting nights, but we can’t blame the game on just the shooting. [Davis] shot lights out and we can’t let that happen.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara came out cold, Davis was on fire from the start, shooting nearly 49 percent from the field on the night. In the first half, the Aggies were shooting above 50 percent from both the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins, the Big West leading scorer, led all players with 20 points on the night while registering a team high nine rebounds. Junior guard Ryan Sypkens added 15 points while sophomore forward J.T. Adenrele scored 10 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We’re not playing together as a group, as a team right now,” sophomore center Alan Williams said. “It wasn’t close by any stretch of the imagination tonight. They completely dominated us.”</p>\n<p>Big Al, who was playing in only his second game since returning from injury, registered team highs with 15 points and 13 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored 13 points for UCSB but was 1-8 on three-point shots. He, along with freshman forward Taran Brown, pulled down eight rebounds for a Gauchos squad that fell behind 34-22 at the half.</p>\n<p>“I’m surprised we were so bad offensively that first half,” Coach Williams said. “We got frustrated, rattled by the physicalness of the game, rattled by just how they came at us. I don’t think we ever played offensively very well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now shift their focus to Saturday night’s game against Pacific, which fell 67-62 against Cal Poly last night. Despite the loss, the Tigers sit in second place in the Big West with a 13-9 overall record and 7-3 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>“I can’t see this basketball team beating Pacific without hitting threes,” Coach Williams said. “We’re going to have to just keep grinding and shoot the ball better.”</p>\n<p>With 10 teams in the Big West this season, only the top eight will advance to the conference tournament. Now with only seven conference games remaining, UCSB must win immediately if it wants to play well into March.</p>\n<p>“We’ve just got to come together and figure it out and win some games,” Big Al said. “It’s not about X’s and O’s or anything like that, it’s about our heart and our determination and our pride in going out there and representing UCSB basketball in the best way we can, and right now, we’re not doing that.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday night’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/","id":670,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[669,668,667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeks to Break Four-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will attempt to break its season high four-game losing streak tonight when they host UC Davis at the Thunderdome.

The four losses came by a combined total of 15 points, the last two each by a two-point margin.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us right now,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to go out there and string some wins together [and] try to get some momentum for the end of the season.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB previously faced Davis, sophomore guard T.J. Taylor was the only other Gaucho to score in double figures aside from Williams with 10 points. Santa Barbara will need to see plenty of scoring from junior guard Kyle Boswell and freshman forward Taran Brown this time around if it wants to beat Davis.</p>\n<p>One of the major emphases for UCSB entering tonight’s game will be slowing down Davis’ outside game, as the Aggies are one of the top shooting teams in the conference. Davis ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage, highlighting the Aggies as a dangerous and efficient team from anywhere on the floor.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/","id":668,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[667,666,665],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel North for a Pair of Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With just two games separating the second and seventh place teams in the Big West to begin round two of conference play, every game counts.

However, the Gauchos will be going up against a hot Davis team. Despite losing its last game to UC Irvine, which was previously 0-8, the Aggies have won three of their last four.</p>\n<p>“They’re playing a lot better and they’ll be at home, so it’ll be a different team than what we saw when they were here,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in the Thunderdome, Santa Barbara never trailed, emerging with a dominant 58-43 victory. UCSB held Davis to 11 points at halftime, the fourth fewest points scored by an opponent in the program’s history. Offensively, the Gauchos shot 44.4 percent and tallied 17 assists on their 20 field goals.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Melissa Zornig led UCSB offensively with a career-high 24 points. Shooting 5-9 from three, she helped spread the Aggies’ notorious trapping defense.</p>\n<p>“I think just like any game, I have to go in there with confidence and I want to do whatever I can to help my team,” Zornig said. “So whether that’s outside shots, getting in the gaps, [I’ll do] whatever I have to do.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, Davis leads the Big West in steals with nearly 12 per game, so keeping the turnovers low will be big keys offensively for UCSB. The Gauchos may not score a lot, ranking last in the conference in scoring offense, but they are efficient. The team shoots 40.0 percent from the field, good enough for third in league.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, you can’t turn the ball over,” Mitchell said. “You have to have an attack mentality. If you are on your heels and are just trying to pass it around the perimeter and not allow the posts to get touch or get a piece of the paint, it becomes a long night.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end for Santa Barbara, the Gauchos will need to be wary of the Aggies’ three point shooting as Davis leads the Big West in three point field goals made at 7.4 per contest.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 53.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re keeping it to our basics and what we usually do,” Zornig said. “We’re a huge defensive presence in our conference, so as long as we get it done on defense, we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/","id":664,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[663,662,661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Day in the Life of Kirsten Tilleman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the UCSB roster, Kirsten Tilleman is listed as a senior, but she is definitely no ordinary student athlete.

One of two players to start every game she’s played in, she’s a vital part of the Gaucho squad, averaging 30.5 minutes per game, which is second on the team.</p>\n<p>Tilleman is also one of Santa Barbara’s best defenders. She ranks second on the team and fourth in the Big West in defensive rebounds, grabbing 5.3 boards per game (averages 7.3 total) and is tied for first on the team in steals with 0.9 per contest. Finally, with 0.7 blocks per game, she leads the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>So how does Tilleman do it all? Well, her formula is, “basketball, school, dinner, (school) work, repeat.” Obviously it’s not that simple though, so I was given the opportunity to shadow Tilleman for a day and see what a day in her shoes is really like.</p>\n<p>It’s Monday morning and Tilleman’s day starts at the Thunderdome. She gets there at 8:30 a.m., which is a bit earlier than usual because the team has to retake its team picture.</p>\n<p>Afterward, they change into practice gear and head into the film room, where they look at the game they played two days before in Hawaii (a 51-50 victory that handed Hawaii its first home loss during conference play). Head Coach Carlene Mitchell examines the team’s man defense, missed block-outs, screen-and-roll plays and more. A win is a win, but there’s still plenty to work on.</p>\n<p>They also go over their basketball tests, a test given by Mitchell to look at the player’s basketball IQs. Sitting in the back left corner of the room, Tilleman is quick to answer any questions asked by Mitchell, exemplifying her comprehensive knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>Practice starts just before 10:00, beginning with warm-ups and stretches. Tilleman leads the pack and is the first to get to the ball rack when the players are instructed to start shooting drills. Since coming to UCSB, Tilleman — one of the team captains this year — has been known to lead by example with her blue-collar mentality.</p>\n<p>She dons a blue practice jersey, the straps tucked into her sports bra. On the back reads the number 32; it’s the number she’s worn all her life and the number her mom wore.</p>\n<p>On the first shooting drill, which involves grabbing a ball out of a chair, ripping and then taking a lay-up or jump shot, Tilleman makes all her lay-ups but the last one. She still made 90 percent of them, but as Mitchell looks over and sees Tilleman miss, the sound of “finish Tilleman” echoes through the gym.</p>\n<p>While she’s not taking her turn, she encourages her teammates. As she continues to run through the multiple shooting drills, her shot looks consistent. Nevertheless, as she misses a couple in a row, she mumbles a cuss word under her breath. It’s one of the charming things I’ve learned to look for while watching Tilleman play over the past year-and-a-half.</p>\n<p>Not to say that Tilleman goes around swearing all the time — because she certainly does not — but she’s a perfectionist, and her efforts produce results. Currently, last year’s Big West Tournament MVP is averaging 5.5 points per game and shooting 51.4 percent in conference play. In UCSB’s most recent game against Cal State Fullerton, Tilleman exploded for a season-high 16 points and eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Moving onto power layups, Tilleman’s power is apparent. She might not be the quickest or the most athletic, but she is strong, physical and knows how to use her body.</p>\n<p>Next on the practice agenda is going through all the offensive patterns. She’s vocal while running plays, constantly communicating with her teammates.</p>\n<p>Then, while sitting out, the second group makes a mistake on a play. From about halfcourt where the rest of the players are standing, Tilleman is very vocal. She points and yells where they need a ball screen and I can finally see for myself how she’s grown as a vocal leader.</p>\n<p>Practice ends after about an hour. While drills are at game speed, Mitchell decides to run a short practice considering the team got back to Santa Barbara from its trip to Hawaii the morning before after a red-eye flight.</p>\n<p>We walk over to the ICA where Tilleman gets started on weights around 11:00. We’re ahead of most of the team as Tilleman knows she’s got things to do and doesn’t want to waste time. She works through a circuit of exercises, including slides with a rubber band around her ankles, squats and abs.</p>\n<p>During the exercises, Tilleman can laugh and talk with her teammates and I catch glimpses of that infectious smile. She balances socializing and working, never falling off task. After about a half hour, she heads into the training room to do some exercises for her knees because, as she said herself, “my knees suck.”</p>\n<p>With the basketball portion of the day done, we walk over to the other side of campus where the Bren School is located. She takes me out to Deckers Deck, which has an amazing view of the ocean. We eat lunch there and talk. She has a leftover sweet potato curry dish for lunch, which smelled amazing. Tilleman loves to cook; it’s one of the things she does to take a break from her schoolwork. After all, you have to eat.</p>\n<p>The conversation flows easily; she’s so personable and genuine. Despite me following her, she tried to make me feel comfortable the entire day.</p>\n<p>She explains how she graduated in three years from Oregon State University, but only played two years of basketball. While she completely supports the program now, it wasn’t the right fit for her and so she decided to take her last year off and study hard to graduate in three years, leaving her with two years of NCAA eligibility. She eventually decided on UCSB, based on its master’s program first and basketball program second, wanting a program in which she could make an impact and make a run to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Tilleman tries not to talk about herself too much because she doesn’t want to seem conceited. She’s definitely far from being arrogant, but she does throw in that she was a Rhodes Scholarship finalist for District 16 this past fall, an award that combines athletic ability, leadership and academics. While still gracious, her competitive nature comes through. She doesn’t like losing.</p>\n<p>At 1:00 p.m., we head to Tilleman’s only class of the day: ESM 276, or Ethical Decision-Making for the Environment — a two-unit, five-week short course. It’s a much different setup than an undergrad classroom. There are only 15 to 20 people sitting around a conference-style table, not desks.</p>\n<p>Overall, the class is much more applied with a lot more discussion. They applied different ethical models learned in class to different real-world concepts. For example, the class discussed the Tigers Woods scandal and why, unlike the rest of his sponsors, Nike decided to keep him. Beyoncé even came up, too.</p>\n<p>The class ends at 2:15 p.m., after which we head down to the visitors center, where Tilleman is scheduled to meet with her group at 2:30 p.m. to work on their master’s thesis project. At Bren, the GP (for group project) as Tilleman calls it, is done in groups and is unique in that their paper will be able to be used; it won’t just sit on a shelf.</p>\n<p>Tilleman’s master’s program is a two-year program with the master’s thesis being a spring-to-spring project. After finishing the paper, she will have to defend her thesis on March 1, meaning she has to leave the team in between games during its Fullerton and Riverside road trip.</p>\n<p>The project involves coming up with a public access plan for Tejon Ranch, a 270,000 acre ranch north of Bakersfield. In 2008, an agreement was made that said the ranch would conserve 90 percent of its lands as well as create and fund a conservancy (Tilleman’s group’s client) to manage the land. Their product, along with the work of the conservancy, will be the public access plan of the ranch. The overarching mission for Tilleman and her group is to make the resource available to the public while maintaining the integrity of the ranch.</p>\n<p>The first thing Tilleman does is get caught up on what she’s missed during the group’s previous meeting and weekend trip to the ranch due to travelling with the team.</p>\n<p>While Tilleman seems very passionate about her project — and it’s certainly clear she’s put a ton of work, time and effort into it — I see a bit of stress on her face as she knows the paper isn’t magically going to just come together. The group has set an internal deadline to have the paper done by Feb. 10 so they then can have time to edit before sending it off to ‘defense.’ As she said, “we’re in crunch time.”</p>\n<p>During her group meeting is where I could truly tell the difference between grad and undergrad work as information started flying over my head. There’s so much they have to consider with their project. That day alone, they discussed trails and hikes, such as a loop trail for their case study, how to label them, where to put them and more.</p>\n<p>Finally, after meeting for about two hours, we head back to Tilleman’s apartment. It seems like a peaceful place for her where she can just get work done (there’s no TV). She makes both of us tea from Montana, exhibiting her motto “when in doubt, drink tea.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, her passion for the environment is clear. While she’s not 100 percent certain of her path after graduating in the spring, she’s interested in working in city government and dealing with water management or land use for recreational purposes.</p>\n<p>For my last question of the day, I ask her how she manages everything. Her response is simple, but speaks the truth: “You just make time.” While it can be difficult, like on road trips when there’s no electrical outlet on the bus so her computer will die, making homework virtually impossible to do, she knows what she has to do and makes those things her priorities.</p>\n<p>But here’s the difference between Tilleman and the majority of students at UCSB: She isn’t just making time and she isn’t just doing a lot. She’s doing it all extremely well.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/","id":667,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[666,665,664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Comeback Falls Short in Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara fell behind early in the first half against UC Irvine, and despite a furious second-half comeback, the Gauchos dropped a 62-60 decision off a game-winning three-pointer from Irvine.

Down by as much as 20, the Gauchos rallied behind strong play from Big Al who led all players with 22 points, eight rebounds and three steals.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Taran Brown sank a jumper with 21 seconds remaining to give UCSB a one-point lead, but Irvine forward Michael Wilder responded with a three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining to give the Anteaters the lead once more. Junior guard Kyle Boswell missed a three at the buzzer securing Irvine’s second consecutive victory.</p>\n<p>“I liked that we played well together, we fought and there was a lot more fight in us in the second half,” Coach Williams said. “[Irvine] got 10 offensive rebounds in the first half, they got none in the second half. [We] became a much more cohesive unit in that second half and played much better together.”</p>\n<p>Boswell scored 15 off the bench while freshman guard Michael Bryson added 12 points for the Gauchos. UCSB also played without freshman forward Mitch Brewe who was injured and ruled out for the year.</p>\n<p>While UCSB is disappointed by the loss, it has to feel encouraged by Big Al’s return to the lineup and his impressive performance in his first game back.</p>\n<p>“I thought he had a lot of rust on him, especially in the first half and was maybe a little tentative and got frustrated with himself a little bit in the first half,” Coach Williams said. “But I thought in the second half he was sensational.”</p>\n<p>Close contests have been unkind to the Gauchos recently as their four straight losses have been by a combined 15 points. UCSB has also lost two straight games by two points but has received solid play from many underclassmen in the face of injuries.</p>\n<p>“We’re still just trying to find a way to get ourselves healthy for a stretch run,” Coach Williams said. “I think the freshman have been stepping up pretty good. We’ve got a lot of contribution out of that freshman class.

The Titans, on the other hand, drop to 3-6 in league and 7-14 overall.</p>\n<p>“Typically when we win, I can say it’s a total team effort, but today I can say it and truly mean it with the numbers,” Mitchell said. “Today, the second unit helped us pull off this win, so I’m extremely proud of the focus and intensity they came in with.”</p>\n<p>Pacing Santa Barbara offensively was senior center Kirsten Tilleman, who exploded for a season-high 16 points on 4-7 shooting and 8-8 from the free throw line. She also contributed a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to win,” Tilleman said. “The disappointing loss from Thursday (against ninth place Riverside) was fresh on our memories and we wanted to go out there and play with a lot of intensity.”</p>\n<p>Down 5-3 to start the game, senior forward Sweets Underwood converted a three-point play to spark an 11-0 run for UCSB. By halftime, the Gauchos extended their lead to 28-18. Fullerton’s 18 first-half points mark the seventh time this season UCSB has kept an opponent to fewer than 20 points in the first half.</p>\n<p>As Fullerton is a team known for its quick guards, the Gauchos took advantage inside, using their high-low game to open up the offense. On the game, Tilleman and Underwood combined for 26 points and 15 of UCSB’s 28 first-half points.</p>\n<p>“We understand we have to go inside out,” Mitchell said. “It allows the guards to settle down and knock down open jumpers.”</p>\n<p>Although, up 10 in the second half, offensive boards and second-chance points allowed Fullerton to climb back into the game. They went on a 14-4 run, knotting the game at 40 apiece with 10:16 to go.</p>\n<p>On the game, Fullerton outrebounded Santa Barbara 40-30, including 20-4 on the offensive glass, which resulted in 23 second-chance points for the Titans compared to six for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re lucky to have pulled this game out giving up 20 offensive rebounds,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes we had mismatches but there’s no excuse. At the end of the day, we do rebounding drills every day, so I don’t care if you’re 5’2’’ blocking out 6’5’’.”</p>\n<p>With the score tied, Mitchell inserted her bench, which immediately upped the intensity. Freshman guard Jasmine Ware stole the ball and went coast-to-coast for a lay-up, jump-starting a 12-4 Gaucho run.</p>\n<p>“I want the ones coming off the bench to know that you always have to be ready and have your mind in the game,” Mitchell said. “I saw that they were ready to compete and weren’t backing down, so I was going to go with them.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos outshot the Titans 52.6 percent to 27.6 percent.</p>\n<p>Next for UCSB is a road trip north to Davis Thursday and Pacific Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 4th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/","id":666,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[665,664,663],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Keeping the Streak Alive","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a devastating 45-42 loss to ninth-place Riverside last night in a game that went down to the buzzer, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have to rebound quickly to take on Fullerton Saturday...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a devastating 45-42 loss to ninth-place Riverside last night in a game that went down to the buzzer, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have to rebound quickly to take on Fullerton Saturday as the team looks to win its 40th consecutive game against the Titans.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, the loss snaps a two-game winning streak and drops the team to 8-12 overall and 4-4 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s extremely disappointing that we wait and we wait and then we play with the sense of urgency that we should’ve stepped on the court with when the ball went up at the initial tip,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’ll continue to look for answers why, but this is what I know: it’s okay.

As UCSB is desperate to win at home, Fullerton might be the perfect opponent considering that the Titans are 1-6 on the road.</p>\n<p>“[At home], it’s not just basketball,” Mitchell said. “They’re still going to class, they’re around their friends and they have family in the stands. Is that added pressure? It shouldn’t be, but it’s like missing one free throw. It’s contagious and now we have an epidemic that we are continuing to battle at home. If you’ve seen us play on the road to watching us play on the road, we’re a totally different team.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also lost last night, falling in a 78-40 blowout against Cal Poly. It was the fourth straight loss for the Titans, who currently stand at 3-5 in conference and 7-13 overall.</p>\n<p>Like Riverside, Fullerton is led by its guards. Sophomore guard Chante Miles paces the team offensively with 12.4 points per game, which ranks ninth in the Big West. She also averages 3.5 assists per game and 2.6 steals per contest, good enough for fifth and third in the league, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton’s tough,” Mitchell said. “They have lightning quick guards, a lot like Riverside. And they’re going to play us a combination of pressure man-to-man and 2-3 zone. So it’ll be close to what we saw tonight (against Riverside).”</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB was unable to handle the defensive pressure. The Gauchos turned the ball over 17 times compared to the Highlanders’ 12 and points off turnovers favored Riverside 20-6.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it came down to that last possession. I think over the course of the game we made little mistakes that in the end, cost us the game,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We knew that Riverside brings a good defensive presence and it’s about being strong with the ball and making the easy passes and we had a little bit of a tough time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a quick start, taking an early 11-5 lead due to 41.7 percent shooting. However, Riverside went on a 10-0 run sparked by junior center Natasha Hadley as she scored eight points during the run, erasing UCSB’s lead. Santa Barbara would never lead the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Hadley led all scorers with 20 points while also grabbing eight rebounds. She dominated the paint as the Highlanders outscored the Gauchos 22-8 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“[Hadley] shoots the ball extremely high, so a double team at the end of the day’s not even going to affect her,” Mitchell said. “We tried to body her up, but we didn’t have an answer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to climb back into the game and get within four, but a 6-0 by Riverside gave them their largest lead of the game at 41-31 with 5:12 remaining.</p>\n<p>That’s when the Gauchos turned up the intensity. UCSB went on an 8-0 run to close the gap to two points at 43-41 with just under a minute left.</p>\n<p>On the next possession, senior guard Angelei Aguirre came up with the steal. Nesbit drove the ball through the right side of the paint and drew the foul with 13 seconds remaining in the game, sending Santa Barbara’s best free throw shooter and second best in the Big West at 86.2 percent to the line to try to tie the ball game.</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit missed the first free throw. After making the second, the Gauchos were forced to foul senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, the Big West’s best free throw shooter at 86.4 percent. She sunk both, leaving UCSB down three with seven seconds to go.</p>\n<p>Forced to run the full length of the court, the Gauchos were unable to execute offensively and failed to get a shot off, losing 45-42.

Everybody is pretty good at home by now,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Let’s wait and see Saturday who we have available, whether or not Al is back, whether or not Keegan is good, whether or not we have Nate and T.J.

Despite injuries and a young squad, the Gauchos have shown toughness in sticking with opponents, but have not been able to get over a hump with a win.</p>\n<p>“The thing I liked the best about what we did at Long Beach was I thought we played really hard and that was a real positive sign,” Coach Williams said. “We were scrappy, tough minded and played hard.”</p>\n<p>Irvine is coming off a 52-45 victory against Cal Poly at home to bring its conference home record to 4-0. The Anteaters also feature six players who average 7.7 points or more per game, and are led by senior guard Daman Starring, who averages a team-best 13.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a very deep team and it’s not a matter of any one guy; it’s a different guy for every game,” Coach Williams said. “Starring is a very good player, good shooter and versatile. [Senior center Adam] Folker I think the world of and [senior forward Michael] Wilder is very tough and competitive.”</p>\n<p>When the two teams previously played on Jan. 3, UCSB pulled out a 74-71 victory at the Thunderdome, but things may be different this time around at Irvine.</p>\n<p>“[Sophomore forward] Will Davis didn’t play against us last time, so that’s a different weapon for them,” Coach Williams said. “There are just a lot of different pieces to their puzzle that make them very difficult to play.”</p>\n<p>Big Al’s status for Saturday’s game is in question after missing the previous three games with a strained left hamstring tendon. Williams leads the team in points, rebounds and blocks, and is among the top three in the conference for each category as well.</p>\n<p>“He has not practiced at all,” Coach Williams said. “He is doing separate workouts, he’s back running, he’s back doing some lateral work and doing some one-on-one stuff. We’ll see; he’s making progress.”</p>\n<p>Junior forward Kyle Boswell has been the Gauchos’ leader since Big Al’s injury and is second on the team in scoring with 13 points per game. Freshman forward Taran Brown is right behind Boswell averaging 12.7 points per game. Brown also ranks second on the team in rebounds and blocks with averages of 5.8 boards and one block per game.</p>\n<p>In order to beat Irvine, the Gauchos will need to both provide a scoring boost and limit the Anteaters’ many weapons.</p>\n<p>“We have to make more shots and we have to find a way to keep people off the foul line,” Coach Williams said. “The number one thing that has been the consistency in all three games [during the losing streak] is that we’ve got our rear ends kicked from the foul line.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Irvine Saturday is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49964\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49964\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/","id":660,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[659,658,657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hungry for Third Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tonight against UC Riverside, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have the opportunity to do something they have yet to do all season: win three consecutive games.

UCSB handily defeated Northridge for the 12th consecutive time, using a 20-6 second half run and solid defense to earn a 56-37 victory. Against Hawaii, in a game that went down to the wire, junior guard Nicole Nesbit came up with the winning basket to give the Gauchos a 51-50 victory and hand the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss of the year.</p>\n<p>“We never want to get too high or too low,” junior guard Melissa Zornig said. “It was great that we got those two wins, but we still need to take care of business the next couple games and take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>At 5-4, UCSB has proved it can win on the road, but now Santa Barbara will have to prove it can win at home as the Gauchos are only 2-5 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done a better job on the road of sticking to the key things — our defensive principles and executing offensively,” Underwood said. “We have yet to do that at home.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the game in ninth place in conference at 9-9 overall and 2-5 in league and has lost two straight games.</p>\n<p>“You can look at their record and it can be misleading,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They had a great win against Washington State in the Pac-12 and they beat Long Beach State, who beat us, so I don’t think their record is indicative of the type of team they are or the abilities that they have.”</p>\n<p>Riverside features possibly the best player in the Big West in senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, who leads the conference in points with 18.3 and ranks second in steals with 2.9 per game. “She’s a big time player,” Underwood said. “She’s a point guard who does it all. They run everything through and to her and our game plan is to throw a couple different bodies on her.” Although known for their defense, holding teams to a league-leading 54.5 points per game, the Gauchos have put together two straight solid offensive performances. Against Northridge and Hawaii, the team averaged 47.3 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re still taking fewer shots than our opponents, so to me, that’s key,” Mitchell said. “That probably means we’re taking good shots. We’re not shooting quick shots in transition and it’s more of an attack mentality.”</p>\n<p>Fueling UCSB’s offense has been Underwood, who won this week’s Big West Player of the Week Award after a double-double against Northridge and a 13-point performance in Hawaii. Overall, she ranks third in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 8.5 boards per contest, and fourth in field goal percentage at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-31/ucsb-hungry-for-third-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-31/ucsb-hungry-for-third-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-31/ucsb-hungry-for-third-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-31/ucsb-hungry-for-third-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-31/ucsb-hungry-for-third-straight-win/","id":692,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[691,690,689],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nesbit’s Heroics Lift Gauchos in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The last time the UCSB women’s basketball team played Hawaii was in 1997 and it wasn’t a close game as the Gauchos lost 91-66.

Despite missing the one-and-one attempt, she was able to rebound her own miss, giving UCSB possession of the ball with 29 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“[Tilleman is] playing with a whole different sense of urgency,” Head Coch Carlene Mitchell said. “She refused to lose tonight and that’s what we get from her every night — the big plays and the hustle plays.”</p>\n<p>That set the stage for junior guard Nicole Nesbit, who used a screen from senior forward Sweets Underwood to drive down the right side and drain a layup to give the Gauchos a one point lead with just 12.5 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“There was no doubt we wanted Nic to come off a down screen,” Mitchell said. “She gets her shoulder around extremely well, so it was a play call to her and she executed it.”</p>\n<p>Playing defense during the final possession, Underwood was able to knock the ball out of bounds with 0.7 seconds left. 6’2’’ junior center Pua Kailiawa was subbed into the game for Hawaii to take the last-second shot, but missed the jumper to give Santa Barbara back-to-back wins for the first time since mid-December.</p>\n<p>“We were taking high switches on everything,” Mitchell said. “With 0.7 on the clock, we knew it had to be a chip, so we wanted to put pressure on the ball. They got a good look, but I think our kids did a great job for 40 minutes on the defensive end, holding them to 50 points.”</p>\n<p>The win was also the first come-from-behind victory for the Gauchos as the team trailed 25-23 at halftime.</p>\n<p>“We found a way to win, so I’m extremely proud of that,” Mitchell said. “We kept making big plays and getting stops. From top to bottom, it was a great effort.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, UCSB found its offensive rhythm, shooting 47.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Zornig led all players with 15 points on 7-10 shooting and four assists. Underwood also tallied 13 points while Nesbit contributed nine. Tilleman also added nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] did a great job of attacking,” Mitchell said. “Her threes didn’t fall early in the game, [but] she’s working hard on being a complete player. It was her night and her number was called and she made big plays in the second half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Thursday when the team hosts UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/","id":695,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[694,693,692],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Televised Game to Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Injuries have begun to take their toll on the UCSB men’s basketball team as the Gauchos dropped their second consecutive game in a 78-73 loss to Hawaii Saturday at the Thunderdome.

In this league he can play anywhere from the two to the five. He hurts you in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p>Clearly overmatched down low due to the absence of Williams, UCSB opted to try its luck from long range, attempting 28 three-pointers, compared to 10 for Hawaii. The Gauchos converted nine of those opportunities, but its top two three-point shooters in freshman forward Taran Brown and junior guard Kyle Boswell were a combined 1-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Taran didn’t do much for his percentage tonight,” Coach Williams said. “It’s a bad shooting night out of those two. You have to give people some credit, they’re doing some good things on Bos.”</p>\n<p>Brown led UCSB with 15 points and six rebounds, but shot 7-23 on the night including a dismal 1-12 from behind the arc. Boswell was second on the team with 12 points, but was 0-3 on three-pointers. Sophomore guard T.J. Taylor notched 11 points and four assists on the night, while senior guard Nate Garth had eight points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>Out with injury for much of the season, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle provided UCSB with solid play with eight points, two assists and two steals in 21 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>“The guy that I actually thought had a pretty decent game again was Keegan Hornbuckle in terms of doing what he is capable of doing and having to play more minutes than he is capable of right now,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Fouls plagued UCSB for much of the night as Hawaii shot 39 free throws. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 45-30 on the night and allowed 20 second chance points to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>“Not having [Big Al] isn’t really an excuse for not boxing someone out,” Boswell said. “We just let them climb our backs and get second chance points all night long.
