To be a man in the world of sports is to shut out fear and uncertainty, to exude aggressiveness and passion and to limit doubt and over-thinking. To be a man is to win.</p>\n<p>Other than the archaic gendered connotations of the phrase, these lessons aren’t necessarily bad on paper. Many coaches point to the application of what they teach even outside of sports as rationale for why athletes should listen. American society is theoretically organized to value self-confidence and hard work. There’s supposed to be winners and losers, and if you believe in yourself and put in the work then you can achieve anything. We use Kobe Bryant’s relentless perfectionism, LeBron James’ refined diet and workouts and Michael Jordan’s extreme work ethic as examples of those at the top getting to where they are by devotion and, more importantly, by choice. Of course they are successful; they chose to work hard to get there.</p>\n<p>Due to the innate link between economic success and happiness in the American consciousness, this ultimately comes to mean that they chose to be happy, and by extension anyone else with just some hard work and elbow grease can choose to be happy too. But what about the millions of people who don’t always have the opportunities or resources or neurological capabilities to “choose” to be happy — where do they fit in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Toronto Raptors’ perennial All-Star DeMar DeRozan made headlines recently because of an interview around this topic with the Toronto Star. “It’s one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we’re all human at the end of the day,” DeRozan explained. “We all got feelings … all of that. Sometimes … it gets the best of you, there’s times everything in the whole world’s on top of you.”</p>\n<p>This interview came on the heels of a tweet which DeRozan sent out in February that simply read “This depression get the best of me…” and sparked a national dialogue around how society stigmatizes and stifles mental health awareness among male athletes. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love expanded on this conversation in a piece he penned for the Players’ Tribune, in which he pointed out that “These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere . . . and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water.”</p>\n<p>There are two especially important points that DeRozan and Love made in their statements, and both offer solutions to deal with the issues surrounding mental health education. The first is that anyone at any time can be affected by some sort of mental illness, although it is important to note that there are very important outside factors (degree of illness, race, gender identity, economic status) which affect both the support for and impact of these problems. The second is that there is a very specific socialization of men, by men, that occurs in the United States, which manifests itself into toxic ideologies and actions for men ourselves and the communities we inhabit.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that in order to start working on the issues of misrepresentation and miseducation when it comes to mental health, there has to be acknowledgment that there are problems in the first place. This is why it was important to hear not just an NBA player, but a Black NBA player, come out and address a topic like depression.</p>\n<p>Centuries of oppression, whether it be through the restriction of access to medical knowledge and care or the dehumanization and desensitization of Black and brown suffering, has created extreme stigma within communities of color surrounding mental health. Black Americans are more likely to undergo feelings of depression and worthlessness than white Americans, and yet, according to Mental Health America, have less access to treatment and actually utilize help at far lower rates.</p>\n<p>It would be far simpler to address these statistics if it was simply a matter of outward exclusion; however, internal attitudes ingrained over the years complicate accessibility as well. Because of historical precedents such as the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment or contemporary exclusion from groups such as the American Psychological Organization (of which Black Americans only make up 2 percent), there has been a cultural isolation of Black and brown communities from the medical community, which in turn has led to the solidification of negative and inaccurate ideologies.</p>\n<p>The characterization of mental illness as “weakness” or as in opposition to masculinity is very prevalent within these communities and has a tangible impact, such as the marginally higher attempted suicide rates among young Black boys compared to white children. By exposing his own fragility, DeRozan has helped counter this and start toward creating an atmosphere where Black and brown children are believed and supported.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that it is men who have to take on most of the burden of unlearning and working toward less stigmatization of mental illness. As we have seen with recent mass school shootings, as well as the well-documented history of male violence in this country, our conception of masculinity or “manhood” is just not healthy. Entitlement and over-confidence combined with a lack of empathy for others might work sometimes on the basketball court, but is a disastrous approach to relationships in other aspects of life.</p>\n<p>The truth is, for women and queer folks of color, most danger and abuse does not come from outside, but rather from straight men of color in their own communities. While all people of color have to deal with racism, stigma surrounding mental illness and lack of accessibility in other aspects of life, it is somehow acceptable to use violence against Black and brown women as an outlet for male frustration and inadequacy. This is a problem for all men, yet one would hope that having to deal with an intersection of other oppressions would give Black and brown men a better understanding of how not to channel their problems into “punching down.” Only once we are able to protect those who are most vulnerable will we be able to attack the institutions or figures in power which are the crux of the problem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, sports both reflect and create culture. Athletes such as DeRozan and Love speaking up about their own struggles with mental health mirrors a recent illumination of the topic in popular discourse; however, toxic ideals surrounding masculinity in sports have also been ingrained into American society for years. It is up to men to change how we talk and think about mental health, for our well-being and everyone else’s safety.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When fans think of professional athletes, most tend to lean towards believing that these are people with great mental health. The reason is because these are people that reach the highest level of their individual field and something like that cannot be done without a strong sense of confidence, both internally and externally.</p>\n<p>However, as athletes are now reminding us today, that is not at all the case. As Kevin Love said, everyone is going through something.<br>\nAnd that is especially true at the collegiate level. College players are expected to juggle so much, whether it be their play on the court or their academics off of it. Like many, these transitions are tough, but they can be combated with experience and a continual growth mentally.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Max Heidegger has had an interesting start to his college career. This past season, Heidegger became the face of the UCSB men’s basketball team becoming a breakout star who averaged a team-high 19.1 points per game on a very efficient 43 percent shooting and 40 percent from beyond the arc.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Malibu, California native was one of the key reasons for the Gauchos’ historic turnaround, winning 23 games this year compared to winning six the previous season. The 23 wins also tied the program’s best mark for wins in a single season.</p>\n<p>However, even he could attest that in a time of winning that the balance of everything never comes easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard in general, everyday. It’s really tough balancing your time because obviously you want to relax a lot and hang out, but it’s tough with school, obviously, and having your basketball obligations you have to do and then also you have to work on your game on your own,” Heidegger said. “Balancing everything and getting your time organized is really tough. For me personally, having other things to do that aren’t basketball or school, other obligations, it gets really tough because I’m not free to do anything until six or seven, especially in season.”</p>\n<p>And yet, it hasn’t been an easy ride for the sophomore. In his freshman campaign, Heidegger averaged just 7.6 points per game and shot 26.8 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Along with that, the former high school All-CIF player was battling injuries, something that has bothered him throughout his career.<br>\n“It was really tough on me personally. Right before the year I got hurt again, in high school I had a ton of injury problems so that was a little disheartening for me, but it was kind of after the season it came to a point where I could feel sorry for myself but I knew I had things I had to do to improve myself and so I went out there and did it. But it was for sure difficult during the season and after,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>A lot of times, we as fans take these things for granted. Heidegger has clearly transformed his game and it’s easy to chalk it up to new coaching or schemes but, in reality, it was a lot of hard work both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>New Head Coach Joe Pasternack and his staff certainly played a huge role in the turnaround of the UCSB men’s basketball program, but at the end of the day players are the ones who make the real difference come game time.</p>\n<p>In his first game this season, Heidegger was amazing. The sophomore led the Gauchos to a roaring 85-66 win over a talented North Dakota State squad in which he scored 33 points. Heidegger was definitely ready come game one, but not without a lot of hard work before that.</p>\n<p>“Going into this past season I was a little anxious especially early on. Right before our first scrimmage I was anxious, because I hadn’t played in a long time and I didn’t play particularly how I wanted to so I was putting a lot of pressure on myself,” Heidegger said. “I was definitely anxious before this year but obviously it all worked out. I mean, it certainly wasn’t easy, after last year. It was tough, it was tough on all of us. We all as a team, over summer, pulled ourselves up and pulled ourselves together.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger carried the momentum of that first game and parlayed it into a great season, one that was filled with many awards, smiles and most importantly, wins. This season was not perfect for the guard as he still struggled at times but, overall it was a much different experience.</p>\n<p>“Obviously things are easy when things are good, shots are going in and you’re winning games it’s easy to be positive and it’s easy to have confidence,” Heidegger said. “I had some games this year when I struggled but even still, playing well and having a great year, it’s tough as a competitor to swallow that, to play bad and go back to the drawing board. I felt that from last year my freshman year helped me out a lot in terms of maturing and dealing with not everything going my way in college. It helped a lot with dealing with adversity.”<br>\nAnd even in a season where the Gauchos were winning games and having players like Max contribute at a high level there are always bumps that could get in the way.</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB dealt with two major incidents off the court and completely out of their control. The first being the Thomas Fire, a natural disaster that affected an entire community.</p>\n<p>“It was super tough on all of us, mentally. One day we come back to Santa Barbara and then we evacuate. We don’t know if we’re going to play, when we’re going to play. It’s hard to focus on games when you have those outside factors. Especially because we’re having to practice at high schools in Santa Barbara because our gym is smoked out. We walk in there and you can smell the fire and ash in the gym. Stuff like that was hard on us, staying in hotels in LA waiting for games,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>I knew it was tough on all of us, but that’s when the team part came into play. We tried not to focus on it too much and just take it in strides, but looking back it was hard going place to place and not knowing what was happening. We thought we were in the clear and then with the mudslides we couldn’t drive anywhere, it was a whole one thing after another. I knew for us it was obviously difficult but I knew it was difficult in the community as well but I know for our guys it was tough. We had a good enough support system between us and obviously our coaches to push through that,” Heidegger added.</p>\n<p>The second thing the Gauchos had to deal with was the Hawai’i bomb scare on the morning of January 13th. Thinking they were just going to play a game that night and nothing else, many of the UCSB athletes were still sleeping when people of Hawai’i were sent an emergency alert that a missile was headed for the country.</p>\n<p>“That was a very weird and interesting experience. We tried not to think about it too much. Once it was over, for me personally, I brushed it off. I know a couple other players and all of us were a little bit shook still but we tried our best to shake it off, but it was super weird,” Heidegger said. “The whole day seemed weird but we really wanted to get out of there. It was a very odd experience. We’re sitting there in the morning thinking if this thing hits then that’s a wrap for us.”</p>\n<p>Athletes do amazing things on their respective field of play, but they are not superhuman. And when sudden tragedies strike they too are affected.</p>\n<p>Heidegger is just one example of an athlete who has overcome plenty of adversity in just two years and you could chalk that up to a lot of things. The great thing about sports is the feeling of camaraderie and that’s something that can’t be replicated.</p>\n<p>“It feels awesome to have guys that you can trust and talk to. At the end of the day a lot of those guys I’m still going to be talking to. It’s a great feeling to have that camaraderie and friendship,” Heidegger said. “Once I’m done playing that’s probably going to be one of the parts I miss the most, being with my teammates and even just sitting in the locker room talking, hanging out. It’s great to be part of the team.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, athletes are people too. They also need time away from what they love doing, they also need time to be with their friends and they also need to be weary of taking care of themselves mentally.</p>\n<p>It is easy for us to constantly come down on athletes after hard games. There were people who came down hard on Max after he only scored three points in a Gaucho loss to Long Beach State this season. But it’s important to remember that, like us, athletes are people, and their struggles are something we should sympathize with, not belittle.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

When that guy looks like everyone’s “cool” high school english teacher and he gets buckets in the playoffs, he reaches another level of admiration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe “Jumping Joe” Ingles has solidified his role as a key player for the Utah Jazz as they surged to end the regular season and kept their momentum moving into the playoffs, where they took down the Thunder in the first round. Ingles lit up OKC for 20+ points two separate times in the six-game series, but it is easy to argue that his most important contribution was getting in Paul George’s head and significantly affecting his play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all culminated in an atrocious 2-16 shooting performance by George in game 6, proving once and for all that Australian trash-talk is one of the most detrimental forms of trash-talk that exists today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingles cooled off slightly as the Jazz fell to the top-seeded Rockets in round two, but he did drop a signature 27-point performance in Utah’s lone win in that series. Joe Ingles has clearly found himself a place on an up-and-coming Utah team that should be a major threat in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Rajon Rondo</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"779091223\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83060\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/activate-playoff-rondo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"756,414\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"activate-playoff-rondo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83060\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=888%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resurgence of “Playoff Rondo” became a major storyline in the playoffs that coincided with the surprise run to the second round by the New Orleans Pelicans. Rondo looked like a lifeless corpse on the basketball court in his seasons without playoff basketball since he left the Celtics in 2014, and we have all been waiting to see what he was capable of with a solid team around him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The opportunity finally presented itself alongside All-Stars Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis in New Orleans, where he finally seemed focused on both ends of the floor and put up some impressive numbers in the team’s two playoff series (10.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, 12.2 assists). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rondo had several monster statistical games including a 10 rebound, 21 assist game in a home win over the Warriors, but maybe the most impressive part of “Playoff Rondo” has been the leadership that he showed as one of the few veterans with championship experience on the roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was often seen calling out plays and defensive adjustments from the bench as well as standing up for his teammates and not backing down to players like Draymond Green. Rajon Rondo is one of the most unique players in the NBA today and it is clear that he still has some good basketball left in the tank, so hopefully we will see more stellar play from him in the future.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Terry Rozier</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1233720072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83061\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/terry-rozier/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=2048%2C1185&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1185\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Terry Rozier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=888%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83061\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117-1024x593.jpg?resize=888%2C514\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=1024%2C593&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Scary Terry” sounds like the title of a low-budget 80’s horror movie rather than an NBA player’s nickname.

He followed that up by going up another level to slow down the red-hot Sixers and beat them in 5 games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Terry is averaging an astounding 18.2 points, 5.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game throughout the first two rounds, a substantial increase from his regular season averages of 11.3, 2.9, and 4.7.  Part of Rozier’s likeability comes from his exciting, fast-paced style of play, lights-out shooting (39.6% from three on 8 attempts per game), and his numerous highlight-reel finishes over helpless defenders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His attempts to embrace the outpour of admiration have only increased the magnitude of his legend among fans and if he ends up leading the Celtics to a possible NBA finals birth, “Scary Terry” might be a name that is forever inscribed into Celtics lore.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/","id":970,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[969,968,967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pasternack Adds Combo of Freshmen & Grad Transfers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team has added three freshmen and two graduate transfers.

Let’s preview the newcomers and what their contributions could mean for the Gauchos’ next season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>THE FRESHMEN</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amadou Sow</strong><br>\nThe 6-foot-9 forward from Mali gives the Gauchos a presence down low as rebounding is his biggest strength. He’s got the size to finish plays on both sides of the court with his ability to block shots and finish baskets.</p>\n<p>Sow played for the prestigious Oakland Soldiers AAU squad, playing against top players around the country and holding his own. The physical big man should make an immediate impact for the Gauchos and could be a big part of the rotation.</p>\n<p>Expect him and senior Ami Lakoju to hold the paint down for the Gauchos. With USCB a bit thinner on big men next year, it is possible for Sow to play big minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sékou Touré</strong><br>\nThe 6 foot 5 wing has the potential to fill the stat sheet for the Gauchos as he has great rebounding and defensive skills. He’ll need to improve his three-point shooting as that wasn’t really part of his game in his time with the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Pasternack should try to develop that part of his game, and he has been quoted as saying he believes Touré, “by his freshman year, he will be a knockdown three-point shooter.”It will be exciting to see if he can make that leap this summer and give the Gauchos another added threat from deep.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay Nagle</strong><br>\nNagle’s game is one of the most intriguing because he can give the Gauchos a new dynamic as a solid role player from the beginning. He’s 6-foot-8, shoots threes at a tremendous clip of 44 percent and he’s shot nearly 400 in his junior and senior years alone.</p>\n<p>If he can play some defense, his offensive value should be evident from the get-go. UCSB was 220th in three-pointers attempted last year, and while they shot a great percentage, they did not have a guy who could just let it go at a high volume with a quick release besides Heidegger.</p>\n<p>When Heidegger and Nagle share the court, the defense will be stretched out tremendously by their gravity, so I can see Nagle making an instant impact with his one elite skill of shooting the long ball.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRANSFERS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ar’mond Davis</strong><br>\nDavis is the newest of the newcomers to the Gauchos for next season. The 6-foot-6 guard will be a grad transfer and will be immediately eligible next season.</p>\n<p>He’s starred at Southern Idaho and was rated the No.6 Junior College player in the country after his first two years there. Since then he transferred to Alabama, where he played pretty well, averaging six points per game in 13 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>He got injured before the start of this season and had to sit out, but if he can recover well, he should be a key contributor for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While he was inefficient in his shooting in his lone season at Alabama, his shot has good arc to it and a quick release, and he was far more efficient at Southern Idaho shooting 45 percent from the field. Davis adds another wing to what should be a position of strength for the Gauchos’ next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Devearl Ramsey</strong><br>\nRamsey is a 5-foot-10 guard who transferred from the University of Nevada in 2017. He’s been on campus for a year already, so he should be used to playing with the team.</p>\n<p>He was a top recruit out of high school and shouldn’t be surprised to start for the Gauchos, especially if Coach Pasternack favors Heidegger in the off-ball guard role he often played next to Gabe Vincent last year.</p>\n<p>He should replace some of the Gauchos’ playmaking needs even if he does come off the bench. The Gauchos are losing over 10 assists per game from the graduating seniors, and Ramsey’s game favors getting his teammates the ball, even reaching nine assists in a single game at Nevada.</p>\n<p>One other source of optimism for Ramsey is the success of former Nevada teammate King last year. If Ramsey can make half as much of an impact as King did last year, then the Gauchos should be very happy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wrap-Up</strong></p>\n<p>The Gauchos may look different, but don’t count them out for a similarly strong showing in Pasternack’s second year at the helm. Heidegger returns as one of the best gunners in college basketball and should be a strong favorite to win Big West player of the year after he was robbed of the award this time around.</p>\n<p>While key contributors like King and Vincent are gone, Pasternack has rebuilt this team with a focus on athletic swingmen. Expect the Gauchos to have a quick, switchy defense and to be more perimeter-focused next year.</p>\n<p>We know guys like Heidegger, Nagle and the other newcomers in the backcourt can hit shots from outside, but the key for the Gauchos to reach a high ceiling could be their frontline headlined by the freshman Sow and senior Lakoju. If they can rebound well and protect the rim, Pasternack will have a plethora of offensive talent coming back the other end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 3rd</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/","id":976,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[975,974,973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus & Answer: Gabe’s Farewell Isn’t Goodbye, UCSB’s Star Aims for Pros","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Co-Sports Editor Sean White caught up with former UCSB basketball star Gabe Vincent and asked him about his future plans, his experience in the Dos Equis 3x3 championship and more in this installment ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82205\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"788111766\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82388\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82205\" data-attachment-id=\"82205\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/gabe-vincent-plays-defense-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent plays defense.

Although overlooked, the journey of a four-year starter is still alive. It’s usually the case at mid-major Division I schools. It’s a reality we oftentimes witness at UCSB on a yearly basis. While it is common at UCSB, the opportunity to watch a player’s development over the span of four years is a priceless experience. In the case of guard Gabe Vincent, who is preparing for the next chapter in his playing career, the four-year process was nothing short of fulfilling as his name is forever etched in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Your collegiate career has officially come to an end. Have you had the chance to reflect on your time as a Gaucho?</strong><br>\nGV: “I did a little bit [of reflecting] after the loss in the Big West Tournament. I took a week off, but that was more so for my body, so it could recuperate and get prepared for my next step. It’s been a fun ride. I completed some things I didn’t think I would or really had in my sights. Obviously, I had some unfinished business. But all in all, it’s been amazing. Everything I could have ever wanted it to be in many ways.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of “unfinished business,” the main focus was to make the NCAA tournament. It was a feat that didn’t happen for you during your career. After going through that, how much of an impact did it have on you? At the same time, how did it influence your mentality to grind for it year in and year out?</strong><br>\nGV: “It’s a motivation. It’s a goal for every collegiate basketball player. At least it should be if it isn’t. That’s the ultimate goal every season, day in and day out. Falling short of that year after year makes you work harder in the offseason. It’s the ultimate motivation; not achieving something you wanted and planned to achieve. That journey was rough. Battling back from injury, looking back, it has all helped mold me into who I am today. Not achieving this goal is still going to motivate me everyday moving forward in my professional career as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SW: Just a few weeks ago, you, Leland King II and two other seniors of the Big West (CP’s Victor Joseph and UCR’s Chance Murray) played in college basketball’s first ever three-on-three tournament/national championship (Dos Equis 3×3).

Even though we were representing the Big West and Santa Barbara in a way, it didn’t feel like it because we were getting paid. It more so felt like ‘this is the first step toward a professional career.’ It was fun being able to play for money with those other guys that you are used to being enemies with. You study their game and film, and know everything they can do left and right. It was definitely nice to play with them and not against them, and get to know them in a different way. Even the game of three-on-three with the rules they had was something that five-on-five doesn’t even expose you to at all. Being able to battle and get to the championship was a great opportunity that went really well for us. Unfortunately, we fell short but we were able to make some money and played well.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Although your collegiate playing career has concluded, you are already back training and preparing for the next level. How has that process been? What kind of regimen are you on at the moment? Is there anything new or are you sticking to your usual preparation leading up to that moment?</strong><br>\nGV: “The preparation is a little bit different in terms of not having games to prepare for right now. It’s more so preparing for workouts and being ready at any time to showcase my talents and to stay in shape. Before, I couldn’t work out as much, especially with my knee. I was worried about my knee and overworking it. But now, with it being close to 100 percent, I’m able to do more. Not having to worry about a game and what not, they can push my limits and see how in-shape I can get and try to get better each day, I’m able to work out more. As of right now, I’m lifting really early, like a 6:30 a.m. lift followed by a hoop workout. I get some food, get another workout in during the day, whether it be an hour or two hours later, just trying to work it in around class [too]. I’m just trying to do as much as possible honestly. Anytime I can hoop, I’m definitely taking advantage of it. Anything I can do to get better.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of the next level, is there anything you have lined up in regard to making the transition to the pro ball?</strong><br>\nGV: I’m kind of in this limbo of being ready whenever my number may be called and waiting to see what happens in the next few months here. I’ve hired an agent. I’m in the finalizing stages of that. Getting that moving forward and having someone to speak on my behalf soon will be great. I’m just trying to get ready for hopefully any league workouts I can get, and just to be prepared for what comes next in the summer. Right now, I’m just preparing for that next step and trying to set things up. It’s really interesting for me, as someone who is not anticipating to be drafted. Everything is kind of slow for a while, then things start happening really quickly and you get those answers you’re searching for.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: It’s a known fact that UCSB isn’t a sports powerhouse. Given that fact, your journey to playing professionally may possibly be more challenging than expected. Is that potential challenge something you anticipate and will embrace? Does it kind of put a chip on your shoulder?</strong><br>\nGV: “A little bit. Coming to this school, I knew that would be something I would have to deal with down the road. I didn’t exactly have the career in many ways that I wanted to. I think coming back this year with my injury kind of held me back numbers wise from the numbers kind of year that I could’ve had. That definitely hurts me moving forward to this spring and summer. But with that being said, at the end of the day, it’s all about who can play and who can perform. I knew that coming into Santa Barbara, and it’s part of the reason I came here because I wanted to go somewhere where I could get better. I think I’ve done that. I’m just trying to get better, and continue to work on my craft and perfect it.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Have you reached out to any past Gauchos that are currently playing professional ball? Have you sought any type of advice?</strong><br>\nGV: “Absolutely. I’ve been close to some guys since I committed to UCSB. I’ve been close with Michael Bryson, who is in the NBA G League right now, James Nunnally, he’s overseas now, Orlando Johnson as well. Those are the three people I’ve been in contact with, and they’ve always been good during my whole four years here. They’ve reached out and checked in on me, and have given advice here and there. They’ve been good resources for me, and a good a part of this Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: If you could talk to the younger Gabe, is there one particular thing you’d like to mention? Any advice or lesson learned that you have now that would be significant enough?</strong><br>\nGV: “That’s a tough question for me. I’ve always been a little more mature than my peers around me and a little more professional with how I carry myself. I think I would give advice to trust the process. That everything you do affects the way things are going to be. Everything I do now, every decision I make now, in my mind, I’m making as a pro. If it’s not going to make me better as a pro, then it’s like, ‘why would I go do that?’ Whether it helps my mentality, my body [is important]. I would try to push that mindset on myself at a younger age, which I think I had a little bit of, but obviously as you get older it becomes more serious and you’re closer to being at that level. These are all of the sorts of things I would tell myself in hopes that I would listen as a young kid and take that advice.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: In one word, who is Gabe Vincent?</strong><br>\nGV: “Wow. That’s a tough question. I’m going to need a second here.”<br>\n“I would say leader.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 12th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/","id":975,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[974,973,972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Eliminated from Big West Tourney by UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsLBSU-180301-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsLBSU-180301-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos season came to an end following their three-point Big West Tournament loss to UCI.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Falling just short of the Big West Tournament championship game, the UCSB Men’s basketball team lost Friday night 61-58 against the UC Irvine Anteaters. The loss in the semi-finals brought the Gauchos incredible turn-around season to an end, however this team certainly established their place in UCSB history. They ultimately finished 23-9 on the year, tying the school record for most wins in a season. Irvine moved up to 18-16 after the victory and are now set to take on Cal State Fullerton in the tournament finale.</p>\n<p>The game was back and forth for almost the entirety of the first half, as neither team held a lead larger than five until the Gauchos went on a streak with a couple minutes to go. Sophomore Max Heidegger did most of the heavy lifting on offense for UCSB. The guard scored 15 of his 18 points in the first half en-route to leading both teams in scoring and getting his first All-Tournament First Team selection. While he cooled down in the second half, as the game went on the spacing that his three point shooting created opened lanes in the interior that both Leland King II and Jalen Canty took advantage of.</p>\n<p>The Anteater’s only double digit scorer in the first half was guard Max Hazzard, who was one of the best shooters in the conference this season. The sophomore notched 10 points in the half and knocked down back to back buckets with six minutes to go to give Irvine their largest lead of the night, before the Gauchos closed the half on a run to go up 37-35 at halftime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both teams struggled to create offense throughout the second half, but again the Gauchos built up a little cushion early on. Senior Jalen Canty was a force in the paint for UCSB, he officially got 3 blocks in the half but changed countless more shots. He also pulled down six rebounds, establishing his presence inside on both side of the court. The center succumbed to the same problem as the rest of the starters later on however, which was not knocking down makeable shots.</p>\n<p>No Gaucho shot over 33% in the second half, and while Irvine did play great defense a lot of the misses were open.  Because of a lack of consistency on offense for the Gauchos, the Anteaters were able to hang around even with shooting problems of their own.</p>\n<p>“We got some pretty good looks. Sometimes shots don’t fall. That’s just how basketball works sometimes. It happens, but we competed,” Forward Leland King pointed out postgame. “That’s all you can care about and worry about because offense is gonna be there sometimes and sometimes it’s not.”</p>\n<p>When the offense isn’t there it becomes that much more important for the team to make it up in rebounds and second chance opportunities, both areas that the Gauchos couldn’t succeed at. In the second half Irvine out-rebounded UCSB by 4, and won the overall battle 40-38. One of the most worrying statistics was the fact that the Gaucho bench was outscored 31-1 in the game. Because four of five starters aren’t returning next year, it’s going to be vital for some of the younger players to gain confidence going into next season.</p>\n<p>Even with all the shooting struggles, the game came down to the final few possessions. After Heidegger went one for one from the line with 2 minutes to go, sophomore guard Essayu Worku came down to the other end and hit a jumper to put the Anteaters up 61-58 with 45 seconds to go. Senior Gabe Vincent couldn’t knock down a three-pointer on the left wing in the next possession, and the Gauchos opted not to foul Irvine on defense. This actually gave UCSB the last shot of the game which was a desperation heave by guard Marcus Jackson that clanked off the rim.</p>\n<p>This certainly was a disappointing loss for one of the best basketball teams in school history. The Gauchos were looking at a potential 14 seed in the NCAA tournament if they had gone all the way, and it could have been a storybook ending for the veteran squad. Instead they won’t be in the Big Dance, but that shouldn’t take away form the amazing year that this team had. While they couldn’t make it to March Madness, this team brought new life to the Thunderdome and UCSB in general, and they’ll always have that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Gauchos put on the most dominating display of the day, as even though all top seeded seeds won their quarterfinals, the other three games were decided by a combined margin of seven points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs ended their 2017-18 season 9-22 overall, good for a seventh place finish in the Big West conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To call this game an absolute wire to wire blowout would be an understatement. Whether it was the fact that four out of five starters scored within the first five possessions for the Gauchos, the fact that Cal Poly did not lead a single second of this game, or even the fact that at halftime UCSB more than doubled up Cal Poly in any important offensive statistic, the first half was one of the most lopsided in tournament history. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were hot from the jump, as an early 9-2 lead ballooned to 30-10 about halfway through the first half. Although his box score numbers don’t quite reflect it, the play of center Jalen Canty is a huge reason for the late-season revitalization of the offense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior did finish the game with 10 points and 8 rebounds in 20 minutes, however those numbers don’t speak to the spacing he creates by being an offensive threat down low. And it’s not just the pure shooters like Heidegger and senior guard Gabe Vincent benefiting from the big man’s return, in fact forward Leland King II might be the happiest to see him back out there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the games that Canty has been back King’s assist and shooting numbers have risen rapidly, and the synergy between them could be key to maintaining a strong inside presence throughout March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of defense, the Gauchos put together one of their most stifling performances of the year. In the first half they limited Cal Poly to 18 points on 24 percent shooting from the field, and the buzzer beater victory that the Mustangs pulled off in their first match-up definitely was a motivating factor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We learned about our defense,” Vincent said. “We learned about what went wrong and what happens when we play defense the wrong way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent himself had two steals in the game, and his constant pressure on the Cal Poly ball-handlers caused almost all of their seven turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior made history on the other side of the ball, setting the record for most threes in a season with 242 and also climbing up the UCSB all-time scoring list to 10th all-time with 1,430 points. Him and the rest of the Gaucho starters were actually able to rest going into halftime up 45-18.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the huge lead, the second half was a great opportunity for the UCSB rotation players to get ready for the later rounds. Both guard Christian Terrell and Center Ami Lakoju were huge off the bench for the Gauchos, a great sign both for future years and the rest of this tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lakoju had a 10/10 double double and Terrell added 12 points of his own in really the first game that these two have been as aggressive off the bench. They captained the bench rotation which was on the court for most of the second half that never let the lead go below 20, and ultimately closed out the game up 22.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, UCSB is taking on the third-ranked UCI Anteaters Friday in the semi-finals. Irvine is coming off a last second comeback victory over Hawaii in the first round, yet they can also claim an advantage over the Gauchos because of their blowout win last time these two teams met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big difference maker is going to be Canty, who was suspended for the last matchup between these two teams. The matchup down low with him and forward Tommy Rutherford will be big in determining who has control of the paint, something that Coach Pasternack has been emphasizing coming into the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The best record in school history and a trip to the Big West finals is on the line Friday, it’s time for the Gauchos to go all out.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Irvine at 9 p.m. on Saturday, March 10th at the Honda Center. The game will also be televised on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The game was played in Fullerton, California at the Titan Gym, and was not lacking excitement. After a slow start for Cal State Northridge, the teams slowly began trading buckets, in what was shaping up to be a thrilling game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a strict game plan, which they implemented early on. Knowing that Defensive Player of the Year, junior center Channon Fluker, is dangerous in the paint, the Gauchos were determined to contain her.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out with forceful defense to start the game, causing the Matadors to fall behind early after missing their first six shots.</p>\n<p>On fire in the first quarter and clicking on all cylinders, Santa Barbara’s offense exploded. Senior forward Drew Edelman had two early baskets in the post, making her presence in the game known early.</p>\n<p>Edelman punching in her two shots, combined with senior guard Makala Roper splashing in two three-pointers in the beginning minutes, made it look as if the team was poised to run away with the victory.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament is not for the faint of heart, though, as the Matadors were down but not out.</p>\n<p>Despite being behind early, the stellar three-point shooting from CSUN brought them back in the game. UCSB’s opponents shot 9-for-22 from beyond the arc (44.1 percent), causing a world of trouble for the unsuspecting Gauchos – especially since UCSB only shot at 31.6 percent from three themselves.</p>\n<p>The ‘Chos held a solid 20-13 advantage mid second quarter, but a great 17-8 rally by the Matadors before the end of the first half gave them a 30-28 lead into the break.</p>\n<p>Making second half adjustments, CSUN knew they had to allow Fluker the opportunity to make an impact if they wanted to end up victorious in the game.</p>\n<p>Feeding her as soon as halftime was over, and the third quarter began, Fluker scored four-straight points for the Matadors, and UCSB knew they had to put in work to offset her influence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly answered her challenge, when redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler responded with four points of her own – and the back and forth action was alive and well.</p>\n<p>This constant trading of baskets continued up until nearly midway through the fourth quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>All knotted up at 53-53 halfway through quarter four, CSUN edged ahead and managed to get up by four, after a pair of free throws from senior forward Tessa Boagni and a stop causing another scoring opportunity.</p>\n<p>This was a pivotal point in the game, as Santa Barbara seemingly did not have an answer and simply could not stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the four points scored by Boagni, Fluker and Boagni made back-to-back baskets, as Cal State Northridge proceeded to go on a run that lasted over three minutes in the last quarter.</p>\n<p>This 11-0 run was unanswered, and the Gauchos were backed in a corner late, as the score sat at 64-53 with 2:44 remaining on the game clock.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos clawed their way back and cut the deficit to 6, on baskets from redshirt junior Sarah Porter, freshman guard Sarah Bates, and another shot by Toler; but it was not enough as CSUN hit a pair of clutch free throws to solidify the outcome of the game, regulation ending with the score at 72-63.</p>\n<p>In her last game as a Gaucho, Edelman enforced her way to yet another double-double, with an amazing 18-point, 12-rebound show. Porter also had a great game, scoring 15, and Toler ended with double digits as well, notching 13 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Boagni led CSUN with a dominating 16 points, scoring 10 of them in the fourth quarter. Freshman guard Destiny Brooks had an impressive 15 points which all came from beyond the arc, and Fluker had a double-double for her squad, as she notched 10-points and grabbed 13 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shot at 39.1 percent in the game, on 25-for-64 shooting; while their opponents had a field goal percentage of 44.1 percent on 26-for-59 shooting.</p>\n<p>This was the final game for four seniors on the Santa Barbara roster: Edelman, Toler, Roper and small forward Chaya Durr.</p>\n<p>With the loss, one has to wonder where the ‘Chos will go from here. They still have great young talent such as freshman Sarah Bates, but losing Toler, Edelman, Roper and Durr will be tough. Luckily they have all summer to figure it out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/","id":974,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[973,972,971],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Guess Who’s Back?

Now that they’re here, though, the Gauchos might as well keep things going.<br>\nThe first step in that process comes on Thursday night when the team takes on Cal Poly in its first-round matchup at the Honda Center. Should the Gauchos take that game, they’ll be just two wins away from the Big West title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Those other two games, however, aren’t on UCSB’s radar at all.</p>\n<p>They’re focused instead on Cal Poly, as if this was any other week.</p>\n<p>“We’re just focused on one game at a time,” Pasternack said. “We’re treating this like a normal Thursday-Saturday week, and we’re locked into this one game. We’ll worry about the next one if we win [on Thursday].”</p>\n<p>Of course, it isn’t just a normal week, no matter what Pasternack says.</p>\n<p>In a single-elimination tournament, even a game against No. 7-seeded Cal Poly has more on the line than any other game the Gauchos have played this season, but that doesn’t mean the team is completely new to the bright lights.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played on big stages this season,” Pasternack explained. “We’ve played against Pitt, Texas A&amp;M and USC, and we didn’t win but we were competitive. We went to UC Davis and got a big win. Our guys are battle-tested.”</p>\n<p>UCSB really couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than Cal Poly to kick off the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>The two teams met just this past Saturday, when the Gauchos dismantled the Mustangs 86-61 in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had one of their best offensive games in weeks, as those 86 points were the most the team had scored since Feb. 8, along with its 27 assists going down as a season-high.</p>\n<p>“That game [against Cal Poly] gave our guys a great deal of confidence. They’re hungry to get back on the court,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>Max Heidegger, UCSB’s leading scorer this season at 19.4 points per game, had a little bit of a bounce back game offensively against the Mustangs, something the team is hoping carries through into the tournament.</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard had 23 points, knocked down five three-pointers and shot 50 percent from the field for the first time since Jan. 17.</p>\n<p>“For Max, you have to look at his complete body of work,” Pasternack said. “You can’t get caught up in his last game or his last few games. He’s shooting 40 percent from three this season, and he’s got the defense focused on him. He’s a complete player, and he dominated on defense last game.”</p>\n<p>The timely return of Jalen Canty two games ago gave the Gauchos just enough time to work the talented senior big man back into the lineup.</p>\n<p>That’s important for a UCSB offense that flows a lot smoother with both Canty and graduate transfer forward Leland King II attracting attention inside, and for a defense that relies on Canty’s menacing rim presence.</p>\n<p>Canty’s positive influence on the offensive end was obvious last Saturday against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Having two major inside threats forced the Cal Poly defense to pull some of their attention away from the three-point line, something that didn’t happen much while the forward was out.</p>\n<p>That was key in the Gauchos’ 86-point performance, which was more than enough offense given UCSB’s defensive performance.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs shot just 39 percent from the field and had only two players score in the double digits.</p>\n<p>One of those players was senior guard Victor Joseph, who led the Mustangs with 14.4 points per game, and had 16 points on Saturday, good for second on the team.<br>\nJunior point guard Donovan Fields, who averaged 13.3 points per game, typically seconds Joseph but on Saturday it was Josh Martin and his 20 points that shouldered the rest of the offensive load.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s 9-21 overall record and 4-12 record in the Big West don’t do much to hype them up as a potential spoiler of UCSB’s title hopes, but both recent and not-quite-as-recent history suggests they still shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos suffered a last-second loss in their first Big West game of the year at the hands of the Mustangs on Jan. 4, just over two months ago, which gave Saturday’s drubbing some revenge flavoring.</p>\n<p>In 2015, UCSB took on Cal Poly in the exact same 2-7 matchup in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament, and just escaped with a 54-50 victory.</p>\n<p>That tournament matchup was, of course, three years ago, and Saturday’s win turned the Jan. 4 matchup into history, but both games should give any UCSB fan or player looking past the coming contest reason to reconsider.</p>\n<p>The turnaround from a year ago began with the final whistle of Big West play and the early April hiring of Pasternack.</p>\n<p>Much of the success in fact, stems from the team forgetting what exactly they were bouncing back from.</p>\n<p>“Our guys have just locked into the process,” Pasternack said. “They’ve had a chip on their shoulder for the last ten months, but they didn’t worry about last season. They’ve been focused on this one.”</p>\n<p>While Pasternack and his players may claim to be focused on just the upcoming Cal Poly game, there’s no question that the whole tournament looms large.</p>\n<p>Three tournament victories, and the Gauchos can put the ultimate cap on their remarkable turnaround.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/","id":973,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[972,971,970],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Following First-Round Bye, UCSB WBB Is Set to Face CSUN in 1st Game Of Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The hunt for the title begins as the UCSB women's basketball team goes head-to-head against No. 7 seeded LBSU tonight in the second round of the Big West Conference Tournament.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following its loss to No. 8 Hawaii in the final game of the regular season, the UCSB women’s basketball team will travel to Fullerton, Calif., where they’ll be awaiting their second-round matchup. The Gauchos finished fourth in the Big West at 9-7 and closed out the season 12-16 overall. Considering that this team preparing for a playoff run lost nine games in a row earlier this season is remarkable and demonstrates Santa Barbara’s ability to adapt as well as the coaching staff’s ability to get the best out of players over the course of a season.</p>\n<p>“This time of year you have to be familiar and dust off the cobwebs,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Knowing personnel sets what we need to do. It’s more about your effort, your activity level, your energy and your toughness at this point. We’ve got to manufacture some offense from the free-throw line and in transition.”</p>\n<p>Due to the interesting playoff format of the Big West, UCSB doesn’t actually have a set opponent yet. The Gauchos have a bye for round one, in which teams seeded 5-8 will compete. Out of those four teams (No. 5 CSUN versus No. 8 Hawaii, No. 6 UC Riverside versus No. 7 LBSU), the two winners will advance to play either UCSB or No. 3 UC Irvine. Santa Barbara will take on the highest seed to advance while Irvine will take on the lowest. First place UC Davis as well as second place Cal Poly each receive a double-bye and will await the winners of the UCSB and Irvine games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[The season] really has played itself out to be an exciting week in tournament play because of so many single-digit games. Everybody’s got to show up and produce and bring what they can bring, and that gives you a chance” said Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Because UCSB is forced to play the highest-seeded team to advance, the Gauchos are able to rule out No. 8 Hawaii from the equation. This means that following Tuesday night’s games, the Gauchos will be met by either CSU Northridge, Riverside or Long Beach in Wednesday night’s matchup. During the conference season, the Gauchos split the series 1-1 with both Northridge and Riverside while defeating Long Beach in both meetings.</p>\n<p>Despite losing both regular-season games to the Gauchos, Long Beach (6-10, 8-22 overall) is on a five-game winning streak that saw the 49ers take down their scheduled opponent for Tuesday night, UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders (6-10, 9-21 overall), in spite of falling to Long Beach in the two teams’ most recent meeting, closed out their regular season with a 76-62 win over top-seeded UC Davis, the Aggies’ second loss in conference play.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, the timely win broke its three-game losing streak and saw the Highlanders’ two leading scorers, senior guard Michelle Curry and redshirt senior guard Lauren Holt, combine for 43 points.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos can rule out facing Hawaii in the second round, they know they’ll play Northridge (8-8, 15-15 overall) given that the Matadors win against the Rainbow Wahine. Northridge’s Channon Fluker, a junior center and the Big West Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, leads the Big West in rebounds, double-doubles, blocked shots and free throws made.</p>\n<p>The Matadors obviously rely on Fluker on both ends of the floor, as she’s also averaged 18.9 points per game. On Jan. 31, Northridge defeated UCSB in the Thunderdome 48-30, a game in which Fluker had 15 points, 12 boards and 5 blocks. The Gauchos were held to their lowest field-goal percentage in program history, converting on only 20.3 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t attack, we took some ill-advised shots, but we’ve got to get some touches in the paint, some kick-outs and some rhythm,” said Henrickson. “We need to execute down the stretch, get them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos dropped their final regular season game in Hawaii, Santa Barbara holds a determined mindset heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play, it’s how you play,” continued Henrickson. “And you’ve got to own your how. You’ve got to be dialed in, you’ve got to know what you’re doing, you’ve got to be disciplined. We’ve got to be committed to making fewer mistakes and forcing mistakes on the other end.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face either Riverside, Long Beach or Northridge on Wednesday, March 7, with tip-off scheduled for 8:30 p.m. With a win, UCSB advances to face either UC Davis or Cal Poly in the semifinals. Games will be broadcast on ESPN3 as the Gauchos aim to return to the Championship, where they lost to Long Beach last year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81810\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81810\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/","id":969,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[968,967,966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Blowout Cal Poly in Senior Night Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-15-web-e1541647561688.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-15-web-e1541647561688.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB earned its 12th home victory of the season with a win over Blue-Green rival Cal Poly.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A 86-61 rout of Blue-Green rival Cal Poly on Senior Night secured the second best regular season finish in school history for the UCSB men’s basketball team. The Gauchos were knocked out of first place contention in the Big West with the loss to Long beach State on Thursday, yet their 22-8 overall, 11-5 conference record was good for second place and the second seed in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly ended the regular season with a 9-21 overall, 4-12 conference record and a date with UCSB in the first round.</p>\n<p>One of the key messages Coach Pasternack has been pushing since the beginning of his tenure with the Gauchos is the importance of a strong home court advantage. After a shaky season last year due to injuries, the revitalization of the Thunderdome has been huge both for the team and the school. The season finale was almost filled to capacity thirty minutes before the game, and the difference in atmosphere compared to the two home losses last week shows that the team really does feed off the hype of the crowd.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“While we are playing for ourselves, we’re also playing for the fans and everybody out there”, Max Heidegger explained postgame. “That energy carries over so when they get excited we get more excited.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were almost a little too excited to start off the match Sunday night, but once the pre-game jitters wore off they composed one of their best offensive games of the year. Early in the first half it was the usual suspects leading the way on the offense, as both graduate transfer Leland King II and sophomore Max Heidegger caught fire. The forward/guard duo combined for 26 of SB’s 38 points, which is a welcome sight heading into the tournament after the dip in production they’ve both had these last weeks. King II’s hot three point shooting helped UCSB build a double digit lead about halfway through the first period, and they ended the half up by eight.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, center Jalen Canty’s return has energized the team. The Gauchos limited Cal Poly to 33.3% shooting in the first half, and a big part of it is how the senior anchors the defense. Other than junior Josh Martin who got much of his 23 points in garbage time, the Mustangs were not able to get anything going in the interior. While Canty does average almost 2 blocks per game, it’s actually his knack for getting defensive rebounds to close out possessions that really changes the game for UCSB. Cutting off second chance opportunities will be huge for the Gauchos going into the tournament, as previous losses against teams like Irvine and Davis show how vital winning the rebound battle is.</p>\n<p>UCSB blew the game open in the second half, and in the process put on a passing showcase. The team finished with a season high 27 assists, which is a school record, and shot 67% overall from the field for the half. Although ball movement has been a core tenet of this team since Coach Pasternack took over, it seems that the offensive synergy of the squad is picking up just at the right moment.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been part of a team that’s gotten 27 assists in a game”, Coach Pasternack admitted. “ I think what we learned is that when we share the ball, when we have five people on the court that can shoot it’s hard to decide who to focus on… and if we share the ball like this we’re going to be tough to beat.”</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly it was guard Gabe Vincent who led the team in assists with 7 in his final home game as a Gaucho. The senior received a standing ovation as he left the court, and although he didn’t score as much his facilitation was what made the offense run smoothly. His ability to lead by sharing and yet still get points when needed are why he’s been the key player for this school for years.  While the team looks ahead to the tournament, it’s important to commemorate Vincent’s already amazing career as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, UCSB plays the seventh-ranked Mustangs again on Thursday in the first round of the Big West tournament. Although this last game was a blowout, Coach Pasternack stressed postgame that the Gauchos are not underestimating their opponent. Coming off of a season where they didn’t even make the Big West tournament there’s no doubt that this team is hungry, it’s just gonna be up to the players to execute the gameplan.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Their fears were realized just one day later when an MRI revealed he had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and would be sidelined for a minimum of six-to-eight months.</p>\n<p>Vincent said that all he could think about was, “How soon can I play again?”</p>\n<p>“I never really second-guessed [the timetable] I was given. It took me a few weeks to really process what was going on, but after that I went through the motions of trying to come back and getting healthy.”</p>\n<p>For Coach Williams, the injury hurt him just the same. After all, he was the man that recruited Vincent to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I am heartbroken for Gabe and the team,” Williams said to UCSB Athletics. “He’s been a stud for three years and has also become our team’s leader. Knowing Gabe, I believe he will bounce back from this and be stronger than ever.”</p>\n<p>Williams got it right with that last statement.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGE</strong></p>\n<p>Once the 2017 season ended, Vincent was met with the bad news that his senior season would come with the shellshock of having to work with an entirely new coaching staff.</p>\n<p>Following a disappointing 6-22 season and missing the Big West Tournament, the university decided not to extend Williams’s contract and go in a different direction.</p>\n<p>While obviously saddened by the news, Vincent knew he had his own worries that he needed to take care of.</p>\n<p>“It really hurt a lot; me and Bob [Williams] were close, and he recruited me, and he was a big part of the reason I came to UCSB,” Vincent said. “With that being said, that’s how this business goes, and we knew we had to move forward, and we responded well.”</p>\n<p>While coming back from an ACL tear is nothing new in this day and age thanks to wonderful medical advances, it is still a long grind, and not everyone returns to peak form.</p>\n<p>To Vincent’s credit, he never thought negatively. He put his head down and worked every single day to be ready come the season opener in 2018.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a struggle. I don’t think there is anyone that has been hurt in that way who can tell you it is easy,” Vincent said. “It’s not a fun process, not easy, but you just have to take it day by day. You have good days and bad days, but at the end you’re working to come back.”</p>\n<p>And while Vincent was working hard, the UCSB administrative staff was working hard as well, hoping to add another great basketball coach to the rotation. On April 4, UCSB introduced Joe Pasternack as their new head coach, and right away he went to work adding graduate transfers Marcus Jackson and Leland King II.</p>\n<p>Along with the additions, Pasternack was adamant about bringing his new philosophy to this team and bring a new attitude. Most importantly, he wanted to bring a new culture, one that “honors the process.”</p>\n<p>“Coach Pasternack did a great job of bringing in a great staff and great guys like Marcus and Leland to help us compete,” Vincent said. “He is a real competitor and he loves to win, and that’s what he is all about.”</p>\n<p>All this constant activity and excitement only made the former St. Mary’s High School standout anxious.</p>\n<p><strong>RESURGENCE</strong></p>\n<p>Still, all his hard work would pay off as on Saturday, Nov. 11, Vincent returned right on schedule to start the season opener against North Dakota State.</p>\n<p>While breakout sophomore guard Max Heidegger stole the stage with an astonishing 33 points in the Gauchos 85-66 win, Vincent was still there, playing as hard as ever. The senior would finish the night with seven points and a career high of eight assists on just 17 minutes.</p>\n<p>“My greatest memory [in these last four years] is probably my first game back from injury,” Vincent said. “Suiting back up with the guys again after something that happened so tragically, and in the midst of such a terrible season, to turning it around to what this season has become is unbelievable.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79677\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1586438169\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81741\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79677\" data-attachment-id=\"79677\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-tops-nebraska-omaha-77-70-for-seventh-straight-victory-travel-for-sat-match-against-montana-state/2017-11-11_stephenmanga_mbasketball-16-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79677\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.11_StephenManga_MBasketball-16-web.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79677\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coming back after a torn left ACL, Gabe Vincent jumps for the hoop. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As games kept coming and going, Vincent and the Gauchos would just get better and better.</p>\n<p>Against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome, a game that was televised on ESPNU, Vincent stole the show. The senior dropped a then season-high 21 points on the Anteaters and led the Gauchos to a primetime win. Even better, it was his first full game without his knee brace, as it broke just a few nights earlier against, coincidentally enough, Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I planned on getting out of the brace a week later so really it just came early; so it was different, but it worked out well, and now I feel stronger and stronger every day,” Vincent said.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the current day, and UCSB has more than tripled its win total from the last season with a 21-7 overall mark and is currently fighting for first place in the conference standings heading into the final week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>From six wins to 21, this season has been a complete 180 for Vincent.</p>\n<p>“It is special. I mean, this group we have in general is special. They are a big part of the reason why I wanted to get back so quickly … because I saw the potential this team had,” Vincent said. “Now we just have to finish this the right way and set out what we wanted to accomplish at the beginning of the year.”</p>\n<p>Like Vincent said at the end, however, the mission is still not over.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have goals of winning the Big West Tournament and making an NCAA run.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean the former Big West Freshman of the Year shouldn’t enjoy his final home games, though. In a 70-69 loss against LBSU on Thursday, Vincent scored a career high 28 points.</p>\n<p>The loss may have overshadowed Vincent’s new career high, but if Thursday highlighted anything, it is that Vincent is back and he will be a problem come tournament time.</p>\n<p>The senior is now averaging 12.6 points per game, on a career high 45 percent shooting heading into his final game at the Thunderdome to culminate what will be a spectacular career.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, this whole season has been pretty emotional, coming back from injury, day by day knowing it’s my last season, so things have been building up,” Vincent said. “I’m sure it will be emotional, but I just have to harness it into a good game.”</p>\n<p><strong>RIVALRY/FINALE</strong></p>\n<p>As luck would have it, Vincent’s final home game will be Saturday against the Gauchos biggest rival, Cal Poly. The Mustangs stole the first meeting between the Blue-Green rivals, 80-79.</p>\n<p>“The rivalry is real; I don’t know how else to put it. Even being at SLO is just different,” Vincent said. “But I am happy to compete against them again, especially after dropping that last game. It was my first loss to Cal Poly during my time here. I took it real personally, so I am excited to get them back over here.”</p>\n<p>With Saturday marking the end of Vincent’s brilliant career, one might surmise that he wants to be the one to steal the show.</p>\n<p>But those who know him personally know that Vincent is as humble as they come.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be just another game. If I go off, I go off, and if I don’t, I don’t, but as long as we get a win at the end of the day,” Vincent said.</p>\n<p>Beyond this season, if there is one thing Vincent loves, it is basketball. This will not be his final stop, something he is very adamant about.</p>\n<p>“NBA is the dream, always has been and definitely is not something I plan on giving up on now,” Vincent said. “Even if I can’t make it, this is still going to be my career. I have to make money somehow so whether it be overseas or G-League, I am just going to be excited to continue my career.”</p>\n<p>If there is one thing this piece highlights, it is that Vincent is as resilient as they come. The senior is going to leave behind quite a legacy here at UCSB, and yet, all he wants to be remembered as is “a good teammate and a guy that loves to compete and win.”</p>\n<p>That will not be a problem, Gabe.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":kt\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" aria-label=\"Show trimmed content\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Rainbow Wahine are looking to bounce back after a road loss to Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB will hope to defeat Hawai’i for the fourth time in a row, as Hawai’i’s last win over Santa Barbara took place in the 2015-2016 season.</p>\n<p>Crucial to UCSB’s success in the Big West this season has been redshirt senior Drew Edelman. The 6’4” forward is averaging a double-double in conference play with 16.9 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 60.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>In addition to her offensive efficiency, Edelman has scored in double figures against Big West opponents in all but two games this season.</p>\n<p>“I told her a few weeks ago just how proud I was of her,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Just being able to maintain poise and composure because she gets a lot of attention, a lot of traffic, a lot of physicality. She’s done a really good job of handling that pressure and not playing backwards because of a missed call or bad call.”</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ home victory over Riverside, Edelman led her team with 27 points, tying her season high for points in a single game. Luckily for UCSB, Edelman’s other 27-point game this season came against none other than Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>In their visit to the Thunderdome on Feb. 3, the Rainbow Wahine were outrebounded 32-26 by the Gauchos and outscored in the paint 42-27, a sign of Edelman’s significant paint presence on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>A concern for the Gauchos will be whether or not they can replicate their efficient shooting against Hawai’i, since Santa Barbara shot 48 percent overall, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 90 percent from the free-throw line in the last meeting.</p>\n<p>For Hawai’i, disrupting UCSB’s offense early and limiting Edelman’s paint touches will be key, but the Rainbow Wahine have a weapon of their own: Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>In her senior season, guard Toeaina is averaging 16 points per game and 6.1 rebounds per contest while shooting 51.5 percent overall from the field. Toeaina scored 25 points in Hawai’i’s latest visit to the Thunderdome, and the senior has drawn high praise from coach Henrickson.</p>\n<p>“She’s a kid who really competes. She’s composed and has a great mid-range game. She gets on the offensive glass and gets out in transition, so we’ve got our hands full, we’ve got to be prepared.” Henrickson said. “We need to limit where they like to catch it, what shots they like to get, where they’re most efficient and be more disruptive in that action. She leads the league in free-throw attempts, she’s coming off a game where she had 19 against Long Beach State. That’s not the answer because now she’s scoring while she’s resting.”</p>\n<p>Toeaina will certainly be a tough assignment for the Santa Barbara guards and help defenders; however, one of UCSB’s freshman guards, Sarah Bates, has drawn praise from her head coach as well.</p>\n<p>Averaging 13.6 points per game in Big West competition, Bates is the Gauchos’ second-leading scorer and knocks down 43.8 percent of shots from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“In a role where she’s played a ton of minutes, and we’ve needed her to do a lot of different things for us,” Henrickson said. “She’s been able to step up and answer that which has been important for us.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Tournament scheduled for next week, Thursday’s game marks the last of the regular season, but UCSB remains focused on what’s next.</p>\n<p>“This time of the year we’re just trying to eliminate game slippage and understand what our responsibilities are to find success,” Henrickson said. “We want to build momentum off the other night and build momentum getting a road win and be able to get as many conference wins before the tournament since we’ve been here, which is a little milestone for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on Hawai’i on Thursday, March 1, with tip-off scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 1,</em><em> 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81683\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81683\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/","id":950,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[949,948,947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"March Is Here!

Two tough losses – the first against UC Davis and the second against UC Irvine – dropped the Gauchos behind the Anteaters and into a tie for second with the Aggies, a much more precarious position.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were the result of two of the worst offensive performances the Gauchos, now 21-7 overall and 10-4 in the Big West, have had all year, but the team showed signs of a resurgence in their win on Saturday over CSUN.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The game [against CSUN] was our best offensive efficiency game of the year,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “I thought our guys did a great job of sharing the basketball and getting great shots on offense, which the previous two games we struggled with.”</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s game against the Beach will be a test of the sustainability of the rediscovered offensive success for both the team and its key players. Graduate transfer forward Leland King II bounced back from a combined nine points against Davis and Irvine with a 25-point, 12-rebound performance against CSUN, and his continued production will be essential to the Gauchos’ success.</p>\n<p>Equally important to offensive production, of course, is defensive performance. In Pasternack’s eyes, the two are directly tied together, as defensive success directly feeds offensive success.</p>\n<p>“This week, our complete focus is being able to defend and rebound for 40 minutes,” Pasternack said. “When we do that, our offense will take care of itself. When the ball is coming out of the net, we don’t get fast break points. When we can get stops and run, that’s when we’re at our best.”</p>\n<p>The return of senior forward Jalen Canty will likely be a big help in both the defensive and offensive departments. Canty missed the last six games due to a suspension for violating team rules, but will return on Thursday night against Long Beach, giving UCSB some sorely needed shot-blocking and offensive diversity.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will enter the Thunderdome as losers of its last three games and in a tie for fifth place in the Big West at 7-7. The Beach has struggled to get stops in each of their last three games, surrendering at least 70 points in all of them and 80 points twice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81650\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"16742538\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81674\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81650\" data-attachment-id=\"81650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/mbball_vsucd-180217-dustinharris-11-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-81650\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After seeing an opening, Marcus Jackson heads for the hoop. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The story offensively for Long Beach State is the same as it was when UCSB traveled to the Walter Pyramid a few weeks ago: senior forward Gabe Levin is the one to stop. Levin is leading the Big West in conference scoring per game, but he doesn’t have another teammate in the top 20.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach State on Thursday, the Gauchos will take on Cal Poly in the Thunderdome on Saturday for Senior Night. The Mustangs have just four wins in Big West play this season, but one of those came at UCSB’s expense all the way back on Jan. 4, so Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry matchup has the added motivation of a revenge game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As UCSB’s last game before the Big West Tournament, the matchup against Cal Poly will also be an important tune-up for the team. Working Canty back into the lineup and continuing to rehabilitate the offense will both take time, something the Gauchos won’t have much of once the tournament starts.</p>\n<p>As evidenced by their 9-19 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference play, the Mustangs have had a rough go of things this season. That Jan. 4 win over UCSB, secured with three last-second free throws, may have been the high point of Cal Poly’s season.</p>\n<p>All the same, the Gauchos can’t afford to overlook the Mustangs, as tempting as it might be with the Big West Tournament in sight. Guards Victor Joseph and Donovan Fields hurt UCSB the first time around and are coming off of strong games against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Joseph is sixth in the Big West in points per game in conference play with 15.8 and has knocked down 40.9 of his three-point attempts against conference opponents. The senior guard dropped 36 points in the Mustangs’ double-overtime win over the Marauders, and will test the Gauchos’ ability to provide 40 minutes of solid defense.</p>\n<p>A sweep of this week would give UCSB a home record of 13-1 for the year, its best since at least the 1980-81 season. Two strong games by King and Max Heidegger would also likely push the pair into third place on the list of all time UCSB scoring duos, as they currently sit just 41 points behind Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent, who combined for 1,042 points in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot on the line for the Gauchos this week, but most important is the first-place slot in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Two wins guarantee UCSB at least a half-share of the regular season crown, an incredible turnaround for a team that finished in dead last at 4-12 last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Long Beach State on Thursday night at 8 p.m. in an ESPNU-televised matchup, and then close their season in the Thunderdome against Cal Poly on Saturday at 7 p.m. for Senior Night.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB went 11-22 from three-point land, their first time shooting over 35 percent from distance since a February 8 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>In a major departure from their five total assists against UC Irvine on Thursday, the Gauchos racked up 19 assists against CSUN. That’s the team’s highest total in over a month, and representative of their rejuvenated generosity.</p>\n<p>Leland King II seemed similarly rejuvenated. The graduate transfer put up 25 points and 12 rebounds while shooting 73 percent from the field and dishing out five assists. That last number is tied for a season-high for King, who turned the ball over just twice.</p>\n<p>King’s strong performance Saturday night was a significant turnaround from his previous two games, in which he scored a combined total of nine points. The 6-7 forward also knocked down his first two three-pointers in the last four games.</p>\n<p>Point guard Marcus Jackson led all Gauchos with eight assists against just one turnover, as the graduate transfer provided a stable and generous hand at the top of the offense.</p>\n<p>Guards Gabe Vincent and Max Heidegger particularly benefited from their teammates’ generosity. Both guards notched 17 points and knocked down four threes, while putting up balanced stat sheets outside of the point totals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were very starter-heavy, getting only ten points from their bench, but that didn’t matter much Saturday night. CSUN took an early 3-2 lead on a Carl Brown three-pointer, but UCSB controlled the game from that point.</p>\n<p>King had 17 of his 25 points in the first half, and was far and away the most effective player on either team for those first 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Matadors simply had no answer for the graduate transfer, who single-handedly outscored his hosts by a 9-5 margin over a five-minute stretch late in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB took a 39-25 lead into halftime, and managed to expand their advantage to 19 with 16:31 to go in the second. That was as large as their lead would get, but it was more than enough for the Gauchos to close things out.</p>\n<p>CSUN did put up a tough fight in that second half, outscoring UCSB 48-43 over the last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>A Matador run cut the Gaucho lead to just five with 6:50 to go, but that was as close as Northridge would get to pulling off the comeback.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, the Gauchos pulled away down the stretch. A pair of three-pointers, the first from Jackson and the second from Vincent, pushed the UCSB lead back up to ten, and a broad offensive effort from the starters ensured that things never got much closer than that.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s Tavrion Dawson had perhaps the most balanced stat sheet of the night with 22 points, eight rebonds and six assists.</p>\n<p>Dawson was the primary offensive engine behind the Matadors’ late-game gasp, as the 6-8 senior forward poured in 16 points in just the second half alone.</p>\n<p>While Saturday’s game was a real reversal of the Gauchos’ prior offensive woes, it was by no means a guarantee of similar things to come. For that, UCSB will have to put up points against a team that isn’t sitting at the bottom of the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have that chance next week when they take on Long Beach State, just before they try to avenge their heartbreaking last-second loss to Cal Poly way back at the beginning of conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/","id":951,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[950,949,948],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":10,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
