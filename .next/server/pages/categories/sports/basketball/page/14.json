While the Gauchos used a variety of lineups to try to generate some offense, the Bulldogs used a hot start from freshman forward Maddi Utti to go up 20-7 with 1:14 left in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Utti scored 10 of her game-high 20 points in the first quarter. She ended up shooting 9-for-10 from the field and pulled down eight boards for the Bulldogs.</p>\n<p>As Fresno St. pressured the Gauchos much of the game using a full-court press, the Santa Barbara offense was disrupted.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates, who ended the game with 11 points, explained her team’s early struggles.</p>\n<p>“Honestly the pressure wasn’t that amazing. I freaked out with the ball sometimes and then once we got comfortable we realized there’s teams who play way better defense than that,” I said. “They’re not any better than we are, we’re just making mistakes. So it’s not necessarily the pressure it’s just us [needing to be] comfortable on offense, slowing down and making the right plays.”</p>\n<p>With roughly a minute to go, the Gauchos bounced back from their cold start as senior forward Chaya Durr knocked down two free throws to get things rolling. Then, sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez and senior guard Makala Roper hit two threes, Roper’s at the buzzer, to end the first period with an 8-0 run. UCSB found itself behind the Bulldogs 20-15.</p>\n<p>Despite managing to play from behind and cut the deficit, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson was unhappy with her team’s performance early, and stressed the importance of starting games with the right attitude.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have a better start, obviously, and better energy, and better discipline on the defensive end. This team’s got to grow where they get some energy from the defensive end,” Henrickson said. “I think we get really excited when we make threes. I don’t think we get really excited from a stop. We’ve got to be more aggressive in the passing lanes, more aggressive on the ball.”</p>\n<p>With the second quarter underway, the Gauchos’ offensive struggles returned as they did not score until the 6:53 mark.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter came off the bench to drain two threes to tie the game at 23 apiece with 4:20 remaining. Porter, one of only three Gauchos in double digit scoring, contributed 12 points off the bench. The Bulldogs answered with a 9-3 run to close out the quarter, ending the half up 32-26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to settle down during halftime, coming out with a more focused energy to start the third.</p>\n<p>After going down 40-31 with roughly four minutes to go, the Gauchos went on an 11-4 run to close out the quarter and cut the Bulldog lead to two. Santa Barbara used three pointers from Aliceah Hernandez, Sarah Porter and Sarah Bates plus a five-point quarter from Durr for its run. Durr scored a team-high 16 points and pulled down a team-high six boards.</p>\n<p>“We finally settled down. But there’s no reason for us to be down at home right away,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Down 44-42 to start the fourth, Durr scored on a nice drive to the basket to tie the game at 44. Although the Gauchos shot below 40 percent from the free-throw line, beyond the arc and overall, they took their first lead of the night with 7:26 left in the game.</p>\n<p>Hernandez gave her team the lead off a made three-ball, but it would be Santa Barbara’s only lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs pulled ahead again with 5:21 remaining to take a 52-50. Santa Barbara’s defense had a hard time stopping Candice White and Maddi Utti in the final minutes. White and Utti scored eight and six in the period, respectively, to pull Fresno St. ahead 60-54 with 46 seconds to go. White, a junior guard, ended the game with 19 points and a game-high 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Following a UCSB timeout, Hernandez came off a screen to quickly drain a three, but with only 39 seconds left, the Gauchos were forced to foul.</p>\n<p>Up 60-57, the Bulldogs missed two free throws but got the ball back on a long rebound, forcing Santa Barbara to foul again. The Gauchos couldn’t get any other desperation threes to fall, losing the game by a final score of 64-57.</p>\n<p>After the game, Coach Henrickson addressed her team’s performance on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have everybody on the same page, right now, defensively,” she said. “I love our confidence, but our discipline is ridiculous. We’ve got to develop more discipline. We’ve got to play the right way, there’s a purpose to what we’re trying to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos losing their sixth straight, there are obvious improvements that need to be made so that Santa Barbara can play with more consistency rather than having to catch up.</p>\n<p>“We had a really good practice [Wednesday] so we’re waiting for this to transition from practice to consistency in a game,” Henrickson said. “Everybody’s disappointed, not discouraged. I still believe we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a chance to bounce back when they visit No. 7 UCLA on Sunday, Dec. 3 at 1:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.</p><div

lead.</p>\n<p>Those would be the guard’s only points until close to the end of the first half, as the Big West Player of the Week was never really able to find his footing on the offensive end, going 5-for-15 from the field for 18 points.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, both senior Gabe Vincent and graduate transfer Marcus Jackson were more than ready to step into the offensive role that Heidegger usually filled.</p>\n<p>Vincent has seen his production go down this year, which isn’t too surprising coming off a major injury.</p>\n<p>The guard scored 11 points in the first half, and had an answer for each USF make.</p>\n<p>He made a pivotal shot halfway through the first; when the Gauchos had conceded two shots in a row and trailed by five, he knocked in a long jumper to keep it a one-possession game. Down the stretch, both he and Jackson made tough plays that offset some of the problems UCSB had rebounding.</p>\n<p>Jackson finished with 10 points on 3-of-6 shooting from the field and a 2-for-3 performance behind the 3-PT line.</p>\n<p>For the Dons, senior forward Chase Foster played a huge role in ensuring that the game was tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>He scored or assisted on the last eight points of the half and led both teams at halftime with 14 points.</p>\n<p>His outside shooting (2-for-4 in the first half from three) spread the Gauchos’ defense out, which was key in the rebounding advantage that the Dons took into halftime.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the talent of the Gauchos was just too much for the Dons as the game devolved into a slugfest.</p>\n<p>The teams combined for 27 fouls in the period, and with both teams missing a boatload of threes (USF went 6-for-33 and UCSB 6-for-19), it came down to who could make the tough shots.</p>\n<p>The answer to that question was graduate transfer Leland King II, who had yet another double-double in this game with 21 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The forward led all players in scoring in and down the stretch, using his combination of length and skill to get key buckets in a short time.</p>\n<p>With about five minutes to go, he knocked in back-to-back buckets, which moved the UCSB lead up to five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos never looked back, eventually getting the seven-point victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes back home Saturday night to host the University of San Diego.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest changes that the team is looking to make is not on the court, but rather the culture and atmosphere surrounding the program off of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to build this program to have a dominant home court,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained. “We need all the students to come out and support these guys. I think they’ll be excited to see the team that we have, which includes one of the top scorers in the country (Max Heidegger is 10th in the NCAA) and Santa Barbara’s best record since 2010.”</span></p>\n<p>The Toreros are a perfect 5-0 to start off the year, and they come into the matchup led by guard Isaiah Wright, who has done a little bit of everything for San Diego so far.</p>\n<p>The Boise State transfer is averaging 14.2 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds a game, leading his team in all three categories.</p>\n<p>The task of covering him will probably be up to Jackson and Heidegger, although the great team defense of the Gauchos will make sure that Wright sees a lot of long bodies coming his way throughout the game.</p>\n<p>If UCSB stays composed on offense and communicates well on defense, it could have a good chance of ending yet another win streak.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Although the USD loss has pushed the Gauchos to 1-5 overall, they host Fresno St. at the Thunderdome Thursday night in hopes of redemption in front of a home crowd.</p>\n<p>Fresno St. seems to have entered a rut itself this season, having lost its last four games. The Bulldogs sit at 1-4 overall and will be aiming to get back on their feet when they visit Santa Barbara as part of their four-game road trip.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, turnovers and going cold in the fourth quarter have plagued them in recent games. In their tournament matchup against University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Gauchos committed 15 turnovers and scored only 6 points in the fourth quarter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their Monday night loss to USD, the Gauchos turned the ball over a staggering 24 times and managed to score only 8 points in the final ten minutes.</p>\n<p>From an outside perspective, it appears the Gauchos have the tools to start winning games if they can manage to cut their turnover numbers down. Santa Barbara has demonstrated that its offense is capable of winning games, posting 96 points in the early-season win over Northern Arizona University.</p>\n<p>The ability looks to be there for the Gauchos, it just seems to be an issue of consistency.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been working to improve defensively in practice this week, as Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson explained, “Today was about defensive positioning, communication and protecting the paint.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson stressed that defensive mentality isn’t a skill an entire team acquires from one day of work; rather it’s a learning process.</p>\n<p>“It sounds simple, but it’s not. Those habits don’t happen overnight so we’re not going to fix it overnight. Today I thought our effort was better,” Henrickson said. “and we were better communicators.”</p>\n<p>“The reason people win is on the defensive end, and how much you win by is your offense,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this defense-prioritization will get the Gauchos back on a winning track.</p>\n<p>In their last three contests, the Gauchos have failed to eclipse the 60-point mark but they have a more favorable matchup at home versus a similarly struggling Fresno St. team.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs have so far averaged just under 60 points per game while allowing opponents to score just below 70. In last year’s matchup with the Bulldogs, UCSB beat the Bulldogs on a buzzer beater to secure the 50-49 victory.</p>\n<p>Fresno St. is currently averaging 15.2 turnovers per game while the Gauchos are averaging 16.7, so the matchup will surely be a test of each team’s ability to keep possession.</p>\n<p>Both the Gauchos and the Bulldogs will be looking to end their losing streaks Thursday night at 7:00 pm in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Win or lose to Fresno St. on Thursday night, UCSB will travel south to take on No. 7 UCLA for a Sunday afternoon game at Pauley Pavilion.</p>\n<p>UCLA has been rolling this season, standing at 5-1 with their only loss coming from a matchup with the No. 1 team in the country, UConn.</p>\n<p>The Bruins are set to host UC Riverside for a Tuesday night game in which the Bruins are favored. Last season, UCSB fell to UCLA at home by a 19-point deficit, so the Gauchos have a reason to look for the upset. While No. 7 UCLA is a team seeking a deep NCAA tournament run, the Gauchos have the talent to pull off the upset.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos get hot early from downtown, freeing up the post for Drew Edelman, it could make for a close game against one of the best teams in the country. Still, Santa Barbara will have to value possession since the Bruins will likely pressure the trio of freshman ball-handlers for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the Gauchos can pull off an upset Sunday, they will gain valuable experience from playing a top-tier UCLA team in a big-stage atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The action will tip off in Pauley Pavilion on Sunday at 1:30, as the Gauchos, look to knock off the No. 7 Bruins and get back to winning.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/","id":696,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[695,694,693],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Stuck in a Rut, Hope to End 4-Game Losing Streak vs USD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is in hopes of getting back on the winning side of things.

On Friday, the Gauchos lost by 30 points to Saint Mary’s 89-59. Then on Saturday, they fell to the University of Alabama at Birmingham 67-54.</p>\n<p>With these two recent losses, Santa Barbara now sits at 1-4 and is in the midst of a four-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse at home against Seattle, the Gauchos had a week to prepare for the tournament in Moraga, California. Yet, Santa Barbara was outmatched by the host team in the opener as the Gaels of Saint Mary’s handed Santa Barbara its third consecutive loss, which was then followed by a defeat to UAB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SAINT MARY’S Game</strong></p>\n<p>The afternoon game began with UCSB getting the ball stolen, allowing the Gaels to get on the board first 2-0. Overall, Saint Mary’s forced 16 total turnovers and converted those into 25 points. Including the opening steal, Saint Mary’s guard Stella Beck tallied 6 steals on the day. The senior also racked up 18 points off 6-9 shooting and recorded her 1000th career point against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held their only lead of the game after a Sarah Bates layup and a single Drew Edelman free throw made it 3-2 with 8:23 left in the first quarter. Edelman, a 6’4 redshirt senior, had another frustrating game, getting in foul trouble early and battling talented Saint Mary’s post players.</p>\n<p>Despite picking up two fouls in the first four minutes, Edelman contributed 10 points and a team-high 7 boards for the Gauchos. Saint Mary’s found much of their success down low, outscoring UCSB 52-16 in the paint and out-rebounding the Gauchos 42-32.</p>\n<p>A slow start for Santa Barbara forced head coach Bonnie Henrickson to take a 30-second timeout at the 4:52 mark. Out of the timeout, the Gaels went on to extend their 11-5 lead to 16-5. Santa Barbara finally got rolling thanks to sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Hernandez scored all of her 13 points in the first half, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Gaels, led by Sydney Raggio. The junior forward had 19 points and 9 rebounds, both game highs, and shot an efficient 8-13 from the field.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with the Gauchos making a bit of a run and the chance to cut the Gael lead to 3, but Chaya Durr’s layup attempt was blocked with just one second remaining. Saint Mary’s led after 10 minutes of play 22-17.</p>\n<p>After the somewhat hopeful end of the first quarter for UCSB, the Gauchos went on to shoot only 23.1 percent from the field in the second quarter. Saint Mary’s used big plays from Raggio and Beck to outscore the Gauchos 21-14 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>At the 6:25 mark, center Natalia Bruening made a pair of free throws to put Santa Barbara within 4, down only 25-29. But, the Gaels proceeded to go on a 10-0 run to lead the Gauchos 39-25 with 3:26 remaining. UCSB used a pair of threes from Sarah Bates and Tal Sahar to end their scoring drought, but the Gauchos remained behind 43-31 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>The third quarter of play saw UCSB’s struggles continue, turning the ball over 5 times and only scoring 16 points while allowing 26. Edelman scored 8 of her 10 in the quarter, but Akilah Jennings and Danae Miller were the only other Gauchos to score, each contributing 4 points. Saint Mary’s extended their lead using an array of scoring to go up 69-47 heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Down by 22, a Santa Barbara comeback seemed unlikely. The Gaels’ reserves held UCSB to only 12 points in the final quarter and an abysmal 16.7 percent shooting. At the final buzzer, UCSB was defeated by Saint Mary’s 89-59. The 30-point margin is Santa Barbara’s largest deficit of the season.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB shot 30.5 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from three. The Gaels, on the other hand, shot above an impressive 50 percent in both categories. With the win against the Gauchos and then a fourth straight win recorded against Indiana, the Gaels won their own tournament and sit at 4-1 overall.</p>\n<p><strong>UAB Game</strong></p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, they had a chance to turn around the next day and compete. Facing the University of Alabama at Birmingham on Saturday, Santa Barbara looked to bring a bit more energy to the court.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a three-ball from junior guard Akilah Jennings, one of her four threes in the game. Jennings, in her first season at UCSB, scored a team-high 14 points and shot 4-8 from three-point range. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, Jennings was the only Gaucho to score in double figures versus the Blazers.</p>\n<p>Using a pair of threes from Aliceah Hernandez in addition to a three from Nina Radford, Santa Barbara spread the floor early. UAB was held to 4-17 shooting in the quarter, with big buckets coming from junior Deanna Kuzmanic, who scored 5 of her game-high 24 points in the first. At the end of the first, the Gauchos led the Blazers 16-10, holding UAB scoreless in the final 4:53.</p>\n<p>Although the Blazers got off to a rough start, they bounced back in the second quarter. Following a UCSB three-pointer by Danae Miller, the Blazers fired back with a 24-9 run to end the half. Kuzmanic and fellow Blazer Miyah Barnes were instrumental in the UAB run, with the sophomore Barnes scoring 8 of her 17 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Fellow Blazer Angela Vendrell got in on the fun as well, scoring 6 points in the quarter. Vendrell, a sophomore from Spain, ended the game with 8 points and a game-high 12 boards. The huge quarter for UAB put the Blazers up 34-28 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>Down six at the start of the second half, UCSB used a 20-point third quarter in able to tie the Blazers at 48 heading into the fourth. A pair of free throws from Radford and two more threes by Jennings to open the quarter tied the game at 36 with 6:41 to go.</p>\n<p>Jennings scored 8 points in the quarter and Santa Barbara post-players Edelman and Bruening added four points each. From there, UAB and Santa Barbara traded baskets on efficient shooting. Each team shot above 50 percent in the third to set the stage for a decisive final quarter.</p>\n<p>The final 10 minutes began with the Blazers going on a 13-0 run. A close game just minutes before, UCSB found itself down 48-61 with 5:52 left in the game. Out of gas, the Gauchos couldn’t rally a comeback.  On 20 percent overall and 12.5 percent from three-point range, the Gauchos managed to only score 6 points in the final quarter. Sarah Porter ended the drought with a layup and-one to make it 51-61 at the 5:30 mark. The only other scoring for UCSB came from an Akilah Jennings three with just 56 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Blazers dominated the fourth quarter to come away with the 67-54 win. Kuzmanic outscored the Gauchos herself in the fourth, scoring 9 of her 24 in the final quarter. UCSB’s persistent turnover issue remained, as the Gauchos turned the ball over 15 times.</p>\n<p>With the win, UAB moves to 4-1 overall while handing the Gauchos their fourth straight loss and first winless tournament since the 1992-93 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

What happened?’ When you lose, don’t lose the lesson.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, Santa Barbara will be playing in the annual Hilton Concord Classic tournament on Friday and Saturday, facing two worthy opponents – Saint Mary’s of California and (2-1) and University of Alabama Birmingham (3-0).</p>\n<p>“I’ll start working on Saint Mary’s and I’m going to have to sneak a peek at UAB, because we can’t just turn that over overnight,” Henrickson said. “Some of the stuff they run offensively, both teams play man so that helps us, we’re not having to work on man and zone [defense]. And some of the things that UAB runs, we have defended already. But obviously our primary focus is to get ready for Saint Mary’s because we’ve got our hands full because they’re a really talented team.”</p>\n<p>The first opponent, Saint Mary’s, is coming off a dominating 82-64 home win versus Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Sydney Raggio finessed her way to her second double-double of the season, scoring a game-high 23 points and grabbing a whooping 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>SMC has been an offensively powerful team, winning their last two games after opening up their season with a loss. A pivotal aspect of their wins has been a strong offensive presence in the first quarter, bursting on the court with shot after short, setting the pace for the game and giving themselves a nice lead.</p>\n<p>The Gaels hurdled their way to an early 11-5 lead in the first quarter against the Cougars, and went on a 9-0 run in the first quarter to go up at 11-5 versus the Broncos. They won both games by over 5 points or more.</p>\n<p>“Saint Mary’s is a lot of ball reversals, with at least [probably] two to three on-ball screens –what they run offensively, so we’ve started to look at that already.” Coach Henrickson enlightened.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to keep their foot on the gas against the offensively aggressive home team, being careful not to give up a lead like they did against The Redhawks, or fall behind too early as was the case against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Being that it is a tournament, though, the next opponent on UCSB’s itinerary is another commanding challenger.</p>\n<p>The Blazers, the second UCSB opponent of the event, is coming in hot with a currently undefeated record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The University of Alabama at Birmingham has crushed each of their last three adversaries, winning each game by a large margin of 10 points or more.</p>\n<p>Their most recent faceoff was against the Miles Golden Bears, in which UAB held their foes to only 2 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The home team Blazers utilized a vicious well-adjusted game plan consisting of both intense offense and suffocating defense. They dominated the paint by scoring a notable 40 points to Miles’ 14, while also outrebounding the Golded Bears, 43-to-31.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Rachael Childress was in attack mode, chalking up 14 points to lead the Blazers in scoring.</p>\n<p>UAB has not scored less than 13 points in any quarter in all of their last three games.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will need to make sure they stay firm on defense, hard-hitting on offense, and remain fundamentally sound, in order to overcome the well-rounded force of the Blazers.</p>\n<p>The quick turnaround from one game to another is not something to be taken lightly, but the factor of the unknown is not an issue.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for us is, we know it’s UAB. We know it’s not the winner of UAB or Indiana. It’s good that we know it’s UAB from a prep standpoint, cause to try and prepare for three teams right now, would be difficult for us and challenging, for as young as we are. So, we might sneak in some stuff on Wednesday [at practice] that might be different for us, that we haven’t seen.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, her practices with the Gauchos are very tough, and is where she really pushes her players to see what they can do. She stressed that the disbursement of player minutes and standout bench play is going to be critical throughout the tournament, especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>“It’s about production. Players earn minutes in practice. Our bench has to be ready to produce. We’ve got a strong bench and we’re very confident in that.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the team, along with the offensive woes of Santa Barbara, will all be put to the test this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will first face-off against the Saint Mary Gaels this Friday, Nov. 24. And will then go head-to-head with the UAB Blazers on Saturday, Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>Both games in the tournament will take place in Moraga, California at McKeon Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/","id":663,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[662,661,660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lock Down Subregional Title With Win Over Montana; Will Host Prairie View Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to extend its winning streak to three after defeating Montana earlier in the week.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB picked up the subregional championship in the Progressive Legends Classic Tournament with an 80-73 victory over Montana on Tuesday. This win marked the first time since March 2016 that the Gauchos have won consecutive games, and technically gave UCSB a 5th place finish in the opening tourney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grizzlies dropped to 3-2 as a result of the loss while the Gauchos pushed back through the .500 barrier and now sit at 3-2 as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB employed a balanced attack to start the game off. Four different players scored in the first five minutes for the Gauchos, and they quickly ran up a double digit lead. Their offense to start seemed like a testament to the heavy focus on ball movement that Coach Pasternack brought to the team as they consistently passed up good shots for great ones, something they hadn’t been doing in their prior losses.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The engine for the Gauchos offense was definitely Leland King II in the first half. The forward had his third 20 point game of the year, and is playing some of the best basketball of his career right now. He had ten points and four rebounds in the half, and was hounding the Grizzlies on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game showcased how much value he has just by his ability to stretch the floor. The graduate transfer went 2-4 from behind the arc, and while the amount might not sound that impressive, his accuracy from three forces defenders to respect his shot and creates huge lanes for the Gauchos to take advantage of. He finished with 20 points on 6-9 shooting, but he brings so much more to the offensive end than box score stats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other graduate transfer, Marcus Jackson, showed his versatility on the offensive end in his second game back from a hip injury. His playmaking ability was on full display in the first half, as he led the team in assists. The guard had a couple key sequences in the first half that helped push the lead up for the Gauchos, including a big block which led to a bucket by Max Heidegger that put them up by 18 with ten minutes left in the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB took an 11 point lead into halftime, but were quickly blindsided by a Grizzly run led by forward Jamar Akoh. The transfer from Cal State Fullerton revived Montana, getting a jump-shot and steal within the first two minutes, starting a wave of momentum that would end with them actually taking the lead about halfway in. He scored all of his 12 points in the second half, and would have been a hero had the Gauchos not had an offensive igniter of their own in Max Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a semi-quiet first half by the sophomore guard’s high standards (he “only” scored 8 points), Heidegger exploded for 18 points in the second. He went 4-6 from deep and made 10 field goals in just the second half alone, more than any other player made in the entire game. Heidegger closed out the game with 8 straight points, putting it out of reach for Montana and securing the win for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, UCSB returns to the Thunderdome on Friday to take on Prairie View A&amp;M (1-3). The Panthers come into this matchup fresh off their first victory over Eastern Kentucky, but have lost by double digits in their other three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are going to have to keep an eye on forward Zachary Hamilton, who’s averaging near 18 points and 4 rebounds a game this year.

The win brought the Gauchos to a 2-2 record, and marked the second consecutive loss for the Waves, who are 1-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>Monday’s victory featured impressive scoring performances for the Gauchos’ starting five, with sophomore guard Max Heidegger continuing to lead the team in scoring with 24 points on 8-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Heidegger’s offensive contribution continues to be one of this season’s most captivating storylines. Following a 2016 season in which he averaged only 7.6 points per game, Heidegger has lit up the scoreboards this season, leading the team with 23.5 points per game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The game also marked the return of graduate transfer guard Marcus Jackson, who was sidelined for the Gauchos’ first three games due to a hip injury. Jackson hit the ground running in his first official game as a Gaucho, with 16 points and three steals in 36 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Graduate forward Leland King II and senior guard Gabe Vincent continued to aid the Gauchos on both sides of the court. King II scored 19 points and led his team in rebounds with 7, while Vincent scored 14 points and led with eight assists, tying his career-high set in UCSB’s season opener. Vincent appears to be finding his groove this season after a brutal knee injury that sidelined him in 2016.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and the Waves traded buckets for most of the first half, with neither team managing to hold onto a solid lead. After 11 lead changes in the first half, the Gauchos managed to pull ahead by nine in the final three minutes. At the half, the Gauchos led the Waves 42-33, and would finish the game with a similar point spread.</p>\n<p>Despite Pepperdine’s impressive performances from sophomore guard Kameron Edwards (27 points, 5 rebounds) and freshman guard Colbey Ross (25 points, 5 rebounds), the Waves were unable to overcome the Gauchos first half lead. The Gauchos were able to halt the Waves offensive runs in the second half and finished the game off to secure a 92-84 win.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were unable to dominate in the “rebound war” against the Waves, which they lost 39-22, they were able to force 20 turnovers while only giving up six. This gave the Gauchos a serious edge in points off turnovers at 19, compared to the seven scored by the Waves.</p>\n<p>After a tough win against Pepperdine, the Gauchos will move on to the Progressive league finals against the University of Montana, who is 3-1.</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies played a tight game in their semifinal matchup against Oral Roberts University, who they defeated 69-64. Junior guards Ahmaad Rorie and Michael Oguine controlled the majority of the Grizzlies scoring with 18 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies emerged as a defensive powerhouse in their victory against Oral Roberts, recording 10 steals, while forcing 16 turnovers. The guard duo of Rorie and Oguine shut down the Golden Eagles on defense in the first half, holding their star guards Sam Kearns and Austin Ruder to two and five points, respectively.</p>\n<p>While the Golden Eagles guards were able to break free in the second half, the Grizzlies proved to be a team that could present problems for the Gauchos’ talented backcourt.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hope for more dominant performances from their frontcourt, which Head Coach Joe Pasternack touted as being the best in the Big West following their season opening win.</p>\n<p>However, improvements will need to be made as the Gauchos’ frontcourt struggled against the Waves on Monday, giving up 46 points in the paint and 12 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies have outrebounded each of their regular season matchups, so the Gauchos will rely on their rebounding leaders, King II and senior forward Jalen Canty, who recorded 13 points and five rebounds in UCSB’s win over Pepperdine, to regain control of the “rebound war.”</p>\n<p>It will take effort on both sides of the court for the Gauchos to outmatch the Grizzlies.

The junior was a menace down low, using his quick post moves and athleticism to seemingly get to the basket at will in the first half.</p>\n<p>He ended the period with 14 points, and although he didn’t score in the second half, the damage that he did in the first helped keep the game out of reach for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Aggies showed just how deep their squad was in the first twenty-minute half with six players scoring five or more points compared to just two for UCSB.</p>\n<p>A big part of the space and offense the team produced was set up by the creativity of junior Admon Gilder, who tallied five assists in the first half. The guard is averaging 18 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists per game this year, and the Gauchos were not defensively ready to handle his versatility.</p>\n<p>He got going early from the three point line as well, which forced Heidegger or whoever was guarding him to press up early and open up both cutting and passing lanes for A&amp;M. Gilder leads the team with an 18.8 box plus/minus (BPM), which means that at the moment he is 18.8 points better than the average player per 100 possessions, and his play was a big reason the Aggies went into halftime up by 14 points, 46-32.</p>\n<p>Heidegger also played a huge part in making sure that A&amp;M went into halftime up by 14, as he had to play the role of damage control in a first half that could have turned into a twenty point blowout.</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard scored 16 points in the half, and even though his outside shots weren’t hitting, finishing 0-2 overall from behind the arc, he maintained an aggressive mindset which led to him going 8-8 at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Even the Texas A&amp;M commentators were impressed with Heidegger, as the SEC stream was full of them praising both his offensive skills and athleticism, and how he’s able to be such a force even as an undersized guard.</p>\n<p>There’s only a certain amount of time before a great team hit its stride however, and in the second half the Aggies left no doubt as to why they’re a top 20 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>Both Davis and Gilder took a backseat to junior Dj Hogg in the second half. The 6’9 forward was scorching in the last twenty minutes, knocking in five threes and 19 points. Coming back from a one game suspension for violation of team policy, Hogg again showed his immense value to the team as a stretch forward.</p>\n<p>He hit tough shot after tough shot over outstretched arms, and he seemed to have an answer for any spark or run by UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were clearly overmatched in Friday’s game. The Aggies are a strong veteran team that look poised for a big tournament run, and UCSB couldn’t win in any offensive category.</p>\n<p>The fact that UCSB was able to tie in both turnovers and rebounds shows just how much effort the Gauchos put in, only to still lose by 19. This game is both a template and learning experience though.</p>\n<p>A template in that A&amp;M is where SB wants to be, a top 25 team that leads it’s conference. What the Gauchos learned is that it’s going to take a lot more to get to that point.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

We’ll get it figured out, you know we will, it’s just frustrating in the process.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting the season with a win, UCSB is now 1-2 overall, having suffered losses to Santa Clara and now Seattle.</p>\n<p>While Seattle played its first two games at home, they fell to Idaho State and Hawaii. The Redhawks earned their first win of the season against Santa Barbara, so they sit at 1-2 as well.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Drew Edelman led Santa Barbara with 16 points and 19 rebounds. Senior forward Chaya Durr added 12 points and eight boards while fellow redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter added 13 and seven boards. Freshman guard Sarah Bates contributed 11 points while freshman guard Danae Miller recorded a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a rough night finding the net, shooting 39.4 percent from the field and just 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. Tal Sahar, the redshirt sophomore who played for Seattle two years ago, only played five minutes, going 0-3 with one steal.</p>\n<p>Seattle was led by Alexis Montgomery, a redshirt senior, who ended the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore guard Kamira Sanders contributed a bit of everything for the Redhawks, scoring 21 points to go along with 9 boards, 6 assists and 4 steals.</p>\n<p>On the night, Seattle actually shot better from beyond the arc than overall. Converting on 10-24 threes and 27-65 shots overall, the Redhawks shot 41.7 and 41.5 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Both teams appeared evenly matched in the first quarter, with the quarter ending 14-14.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth first quarter, which was hardly impressive for either team, Santa Barbara went on a run in the second to take a 23-18 lead and forced a Seattle timeout with 5:46 remaining.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, the Gauchos maintained their momentum. Porter contributed 10 of her 13 points in the second quarter. With the Redhawks shooting only 25 percent from the field in the quarter, the Gauchos were able to end the half with a slight edge at a 36-24 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened the second half with energy and looked to be in control.</p>\n<p>With 5:39 to go in the third, the Gauchos used a Bates three to go up 51-30, leading by their largest margin of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, it gave up a 15-9 Seattle run to end the quarter. The Redhawks used big scoring from Montgomery and a handful of three-pointers for their 21-point quarter. While Seattle remained down 15 heading into the fourth, Santa Barbara appeared to have gotten too comfortable with its lead.</p>\n<p>In the final quarter, Seattle made a huge comeback, shocking the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Seattle held the Gauchos to an abysmal 5-for-20 shooting and only 1-for-6 performance from beyond the arc in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshmen guards Cece Quintino, Bates and Miller each faced heavy pressure from the Seattle defense, led primarily by the pestering defense of McKenzie Williams. Williams seemed to have the young guards’ numbers in the fourth, making it a hard task for Santa Barbara to simply get the ball across half court at times.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finally got their offense rolling in the fourth, using a big quarter from Kamira Sanders. Sanders had 13 points on 5-for-5 shooting to go with 6 rebounds, 2 assists and a steal in the fourth quarter alone.</p>\n<p>Shooting 62.5 percent from three helped the Redhawks overcome the deficit, making 5-of-8 shots from beyond the arc. Fans watched in disbelief as the Gauchos squandered their 21-point lead and Seattle came storming back. While the Gauchos were held to 11 points in the quarter, Seattle put up 32.</p>\n<p>After a few back and forth possessions of Seattle chipping away at Santa Barbara’s lead, it looked like UCSB had a chance to regain its composure.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought the ball up the floor with 2:56 remaining, up 71-70. Santa Barbara got the ball inside to Edelman on a nice feed that gave the forward a clean look, but the 6’4 forward could not convert.</p>\n<p>Frustration seemed to kick in for the Gauchos, as missed shots and an unanswered 7-0 run by Seattle pushed Santa Barbara into desperation mode. The Gauchos ended the game with three possessions each ending in badly-missed three-point shots, and Seattle made enough of its free-throws to close out the game.</p>\n<p>Scoreless in the final 2:56, the Gauchos fell to the Redhawks 77-71.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, it will have a week break to perhaps solidify its defense and work on running its offense the way Coach Henrickson wants. UCSB will travel to Moraga, CA for the Saint Mary’s Tournament, which will begin this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Although Heidegger finished 4-for-15 from the field with only 13 points, he played outstanding in the first half, helping push the Gaucho lead to as high as 10 before it fell to six going into halftime, 38-32.</p>\n<p>The Pitt defense woke up in the second half, however, limiting UCSB to 24 points. The Gauchos’ poor free-throw shooting, in which they converted 10-of-22 free throws, was one component that stunted their scoring.</p>\n<p>As the game wore on and Pitt’s offense picked up, the Gauchos weren’t able to consistently depend on their inside game and often had to launch desperation three-pointers at the end of the shot clock.</p>\n<p>The Panthers relied on a balanced offensive approach for the game, as they had five players in double digits. While UCSB did a good job containing senior forward Ryan Luther on offense, holding him to 13 points, he snuck out for some clutch baskets late in the game and was dominant on the glass, finishing with 10 rebounds to round out his double-double performance.</p>\n<p>Most of the Gauchos’ offense went through King II, who performed great under the pressure of the hostile crowd, but was unable to complete the task of carrying the team to victory.</p>\n<p>He finished with 22 points and 8 rebounds, an almost identical stat line compared to his numbers in the team’s season opener, yet ultimately a lack of help on the offensive end from his teammates led to the game slipping away as the game’s final minutes ticked away.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the Gauchos’ next opponent is Texas A&amp;M, who showed flashes of a team with top 10 potential, having dominated then No. 11 West Virginia 88-65 in its first game.</p>\n<p>Center Tyler Davis is certainly one Aggie player the Gauchos will attempt to contain. The junior scored 23 points and grabbed 13 rebounds on the way to his first double-double of the year last weekend.</p>\n<p>Davis averaged 14 points and 7 rebounds in 2016-17 and seems to be looking to carry a bigger offensive workload this year.</p>\n<p>It will be up to UCSB’s senior forward Jalen Canty to keep up with Davis, which will be an interesting challenge considering he has shown signs of dominance through two games down low and on the boards, nearly averaging a double-double (11.5 points and 9 rebounds per game).</p>\n<p>Another high impact player for the Aggies is junior guard Admon Gilder, who also picked up 23 points in their opening blowout. He finished with nine rebounds and seven assists, a testament to just how versatile of a player he is.</p>\n<p>His combination of speed and size makes him a tough cover for both guards and forwards, and the Gauchos will have to find a way to disrupt his game if they want to get stops on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are also a top rebounding team in the country, having snatched up 47 rebounds against WVU, which should be a focal point for the Gauchos coming into the matchup.</p>\n<p>In Wednesday night’s close loss against Pitt, there were a few late-game offensive boards that UCSB surrendered which really cost them in allowing second-chance points.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game won’t even be close if the Aggies control the paint, something that the Gaucho frontcourt will have to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>This will be one of the biggest tests for the Gauchos this year, both in terms of how they respond to a loss and going up against an Associated Poll (AP) ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>Many of the problems that they had against the Panthers were self-inflicted, whether it be missing free throws or defensive assignments, and in a loud venue like Reed Arena, discipline will be hard to keep.</p>\n<p>It’s going to take a lot to beat Texas A&amp;M, but UCSB’s best chance is going to be knocking down the good looks they get and cleaning up the glass.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos manage to do both, they’ll have a great opportunity to spoil the Aggies home opener.</p>\n<p>UCSB and No. 16 Texas A&amp;M will tip-off at 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 17. The game will be played at Reed Arena.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Redhawks recorded a 58-53 victory over the Gauchos last season.</p>\n<p>An interesting aspect of Friday’s matchup between Santa Barbara and Seattle is that redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar used to play for Seattle prior to transferring to UCSB last season.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Redhawks, Sahar averaged 10.2 points as a freshman while also shooting 38 percent from a three-point range.<br>\nSahar, who sat out last year due to NCAA transfer rules, has brought the Gauchos an increased shooting ability and length on the perimeter.</p>\n<p>In spite of the intangibles she possesses, Sahar hasn’t had much of an impact in the team’s two games.</p>\n<p>She has yet to score a point and has gone 0-for-3 from the field and 0-2 from behind the three-point line in each contest.</p>\n<p>While Sahar has slowed down considerably in terms of production following 14 points in her debut in the Gauchos’ exhibition win over CSU East Bay, the 5’11” guard is understandably getting accustomed after not playing a single game last season.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Sahar will get into more of a rhythm facing her old team.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, its turnover woes have continued.</p>\n<p>While it is early in the season and the team will likely tighten up its offense as it develops more chemistry, the Gauchos turned the ball over 21 times Tuesday night against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Many of these turnovers can be attributed to Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson’s decision to start two true freshmen, Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, and Santa Clara managed to take advantage of the young guards’ inexperience at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>While redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman scored a game-high 23 points on 50 percent shooting, the Gauchos will need to get more contributions from their role players if they wish to win games this season.</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos are hoping will emerge soon is redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>In the team’s first two games, she shot a combined 8-for-19 from the field and has really been missed from beyond the arc, where she has gone 4-for-12. Notably, after playing 32 minutes in UCSB’s season opener, Porter only played 15 minutes in the team’s loss to Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>No other Gaucho reached double-digit scoring versus Santa Clara, allowing defenses to focus primarily on containing Edelman in the post.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has the talent to disrupt defenses, with plenty of shooting ability, but perhaps Henrickson will have to stress ball movement to find open shots on kick-outs from Edelman.<br>\nSanta Barbara has so far shot 45.7 percent from downtown this season, so it seems it will only be a matter of getting more opportunities from three-point land in order to generate offense.</p>\n<p>Facing Seattle may be the remedy the Gauchos are looking for, as the Redhawks have allowed opponents to score at least 73 points in both of their losses.</p>\n<p>Seattle is coming off a season in which it went 15-18 overall and 10-4 in Western Athletic Conference (WAC) play.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finished tied for second in the WAC and made it to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament, where they lost their first-round game to Wyoming.</p>\n<p>In her second season, Seattle Head Coach Suzy Barcomb is looking to improve even in the face of losing three of her starters from last season.</p>\n<p>Barcomb seems to have the experience and knowledge to make her capable of leading this year’s Seattle team back into postseason play.<br>\nIn her total 18 seasons of coaching, Barcomb has a win percentage of .640, holding a record of 320-180 overall.</p>\n<p>Increasing the likelihood of sustaining such success definitely becomes more plausible with a player like Alexis Montgomery.</p>\n<p>The redshirt senior two-guard is currently the team’s leading scorer at 23.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact is the reigning WAC Freshman of the Year recipient, sophomore guard Kamira Sanders, whose 13.5 PPG ranks second on the team.<br>\nFriday’s home opener will tip off at 7 p.m. on Nov. 17 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Suddenly, UCSB found themselves down 11 points with 8:18 left in the fourth and would have to gouge their way back if they wanted a shot at winning the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to have turnover woes, with two turnovers early in the final frame preventing them from gaining any headway.</p>\n<p>Powerfully pursuing the challenge of fighting an uphill battle, halfway through the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara began to gallop back into the game, offsetting their scoring struggles with a 9-2 scoring clinic as time dwindled down just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>The visiting Gauchos grew electrifyingly aggressive on defense as the quarter went on, with a series of great defensive stands resulting in UCSB taking four charges down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Down eight with 2:26 to go, the Gauchos rallied off five straight points to cut the score to 61-64 with just under 36 seconds left thanks to a surge led by yet another Bates three-pointer and topped off with a clutch layup by redshirt Junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Porter’s layup, things seemed to be going Santa Barbara’s way, as after an intentional foul by the Gauchos, the Broncos junior guard Dru Toleafoa proceeded to miss both free throws giving the visiting team the opportunity to tie the game up in the next possession.</p>\n<p>However, the anticipated late-quarter comeback was immediately put to rest when the Gauchos had a calamitous turnover by freshman guard Danae Miller on the inbounds play. UCSB tried to continue playing the foul game but to no avail as its fate was sealed losing its first game of the season, 68-63.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 45.8 percent on 22 for 48 shooting, while the home team shot at a better 47.1 percent on 24 for 51 shooting.</p>\n<p>21 Gaucho turnovers had a massive impact on the outcome of the game, as there were too many giveaways late in the game for Santa Barbara to recover. Each mistake proved to be more costly than the last, as Santa Clara scored 19 points off those turnovers.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another consistent high scoring game. Edelman was the lone Gaucho to score in double figures and led all scorers with 23 points, and grabbed a team-leading six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Though the Broncos’ leading scorer Wolph was inactive for the game they still had weapons to rely upon as senior guard Kyla Martin and Toleafoa both had double-digit nights with 17 points each to overshadow Santa Barbara and Edelman’s solid offensive night to come away with their first win of the new campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Santa Clara both had five wins apiece in the history of these two programs, but it is the Broncos now who holds the all-time lead thus far, 6-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back on the court at 7 pm this Friday, Nov. 17 as they faceoff against Seattle University in the Thunderdome for their first home game of the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/","id":215,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[214,213,212],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes Head-to-Head With Pitt in Start of Progressive League Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-12.11.43-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-12.11.43-PM.png?resize=628%2C380&ssl=1","description":"The start of its most challenging portion of its non-conference season begins Wednesday when the UCSB men's basketball team takes on the University of Pittsburgh on the road.

Santa Barbara’s dependence on the second-year guard is not only in terms of scoring, but also includes the duty of running the Gauchos’ offense.</p>\n<p>Down in the post, both Jalen Canty and Leland King II will be battling on the frontlines of what the Gauchos like to call the “rebound war.”</p>\n<p>King II scooped up a game high nine rebounds in UCSB’s last game against NDSU while Canty notched seven, but it will be a whole new battle against the strong frontcourt of the Panthers, who currently average 34 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ post-game conference this past Saturday, UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack stressed the value that this team gives to winning rebounds and loose balls. This is valuable as doing such dirty work is essential when going up against any Power-5 conference opponent such as Pitt.</p>\n<p>The Panthers come into the game 0-2, which means the Gauchos are more than likely going to withstand a big burst of energy to start the game. Pitt has trailed to start the second half in both of their games this year, something the coaching staff will certainly be looking to change.</p>\n<p>It’s going to be up to UCSB to keep the home crowd out of the game and match Pitt’s runs, which starts on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>One major aspect of the defensive game plan for UCSB will be limiting the production of Pittsburgh’s two most dynamic players, junior guard Jared Wilson-Frame and senior forward Ryan Luther.</p>\n<p>The junior combo guard out of Hartford, Conn., is averaging 17.5 points per game so far,and is most lethal when maneuvering his 6’5” frame into getting a good shot over smaller defenders.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Luther has been a force in the paint thus far. He was the team’s leading scorer last year and has shown solid production for both rebounds and scoring as he is currently averaging 16 points and 9.5 rebounds through two games this season.</p>\n<p>Last game, the Gauchos were able to stifle NDSU’s offense with an active and switch-heavy defense. It was easier to switch against the Bison because their best player was a guard, but having to face a skilled big man like Luther offers a different concern for their defensive game plan.</p>\n<p>How UCSB communicates on pick and rolls will be a big factor in how effective their defense is on Wednesday, as switching too much can lead to big mismatches.</p>\n<p>If Saturday’s game was any indication, the Gauchos have a lot of firepower. They turned in their first 80-point performance since the first round of the Big West Tournament in 2016 with ease and have a few players that can catch fire at any time.</p>\n<p>However, a hot shooting night may not just be enough while on the road. Going forward with this next slate of opponents, high discipline on both ends of the floor will be the most important goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Pitt at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, November 15 at the Petersen Events Center. The game will also be streamed on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Their most recent faceoff with the Broncos was in the 2016-2017 season, which resulted in a 69-58 loss for the Gauchos at home.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has not defeated Santa Clara since Nov. 23, 2013 while on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 48.5 percent on 33-for-68 shooting against Northern Arizona last game, with four Gauchos scoring in double-digits. Freshman guard Sarah Bates led the team with a commanding 25 points, helping keep UCSB’s offensive success afloat.</p>\n<p>To replicate another win, UCSB will need to come out with the same firepower, as was the case against the Lumberjacks. The Gauchos shot 7-for- 9 from three-point range in the first quarter and 14-for-30 from downtown overall.</p>\n<p>Despite the Gauchos’ offensive surge beyond the arc – defensively, they seemed sparse.</p>\n<p>Allowing the Lumberjacks to score on 47.4 percent shooting, the Gauchos woefully permitted Northern Arizona to score 14 points off 11 turnovers, and was beat by NAU on the boards.</p>\n<p>Defense will be a key factor in the bout against Santa Clara, as the Broncos established a strong defensive presence against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara forced 20 turnovers and tallied 16 steals in its matchup against the Titans. Santa Barbara will need to be cautious when in possession of the ball as the Broncos scored 22 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>A crucial player for the Broncos to look out for will be Santa Clara junior guard Emily Wolph, who is fresh off a career-high 27-point game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Wolph, the Broncos have found a way to share the wealth as a result of other players scoring. Senior guards Taylor Berry (14), Kyla Martin (11), and senior forward Morgan McGwire (11) all scored double digits in the Broncos’ loss to Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Broncos loss to the Titans at home was highlighted by a 7-minute scoreless stretch in the fourth quarter. It will be essential for the visiting Gauchos to take advantage of such stretches if they occur by being assertive offensively.</p>\n<p>UCSB goes into the game having lost the rebound battle between itself and Northern Arizona (38-43). An advantage on the boards could ignite success for the Gauchos considering that Santa Clara only recorded 28 rebounds against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>An opportunity to win the battle on the boards could translate into the extension of possessions which turns into buckets.</p>\n<p>Bench play will also have an enormous impact on the game, as UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjacks 26-14. Santa Clara had subpar production from its bench last game, only scoring 15 as a unit.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos undeniably have more depth than the Broncos. During their last game, Santa Clara had three players well over 30 minutes of playing time, while UCSB only had two players who scarcely played over half an hour.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has to be sure to exploit Santa Clara’s endurance and keep the momentum in its favor by using the depth of its roster in hopes of out hustling the opposing team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will go head-to-head with Santa Clara at the Leavey Center on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/","id":657,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[656,655,654],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":14,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
