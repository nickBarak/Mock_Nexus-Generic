We have to be able to start a game and play with that type of energy and motor to be successful.”</p>\n<p>Currently in fifth-place of the conference standings, the Gauchos enter tonight’s game with an 11-18 overall and 8-7 Big West record. Their current total of eight conference wins is the program’s most since the 2012-13 season, in which UCSB finished with 11.</p>\n<p>After nearly handing conference undefeated UCR its first league loss over the weekend, Hawaii will attempt to improve its 17-10 overall, 10-4 conference record.</p>\n<p>It’s a pivotal final two games for the Rainbow Wahine as they are currently tied with LBSU for the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s pursuit of the No. 4 seed has deterred in the past two weeks, the Gauchos will hope to lock down the fifth seed with a win tonight and a loss by Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, who will face Hawaii this Saturday.</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can look ahead to the postseason, its offense will hope to overcome its inefficient shooting start in its first matchup versus Hawaii.</p>\n<p>It begins with the Gauchos’ pair of sharpshooters—sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. While they each managed to sink key three-pointers in the fourth quarter of the first game, more will be expected from the two tonight.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the team’s first meeting versus Hawaii with six points on a 2-14 overall and 1-8 shooting performance while Miller went 2-9 from the field and 1-3 from beyond the arc for five points. As of recently, Roper has been plagued by turnovers, finishing with four or more in UCSB’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Both will look to shake their latest shooting slumps as well as Miller has not scored in double-figures in the last three games, while Roper has done so just once during the same span of contests.</p>\n<p>“We were really impatient and undisciplined about trying to drive it and get to the rim on the first side,” Henrickson said. “You have to make the defense move and switch sides, that’ll help both of those two. The fact that we were driving it downhill on the first side and not making the defense work that turned into bad shots and no offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the majority of this season, Coach Henrickson has reassured that the Gauchos’ defense is their best source of offense. UCSB’s testament to defense will be tested tonight as it will attempt to contain senior guard/forward Destiny King.</p>\n<p>King leads the Rainbow Wahine as their only double-figure scorer averaging 10.6 points per game. She scored a game-high 17 points in the first meeting against UCSB, scoring 12 in the second half while finishing 9-12 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is her versatility when not shooting the ball that makes her into such a vital component for Hawaii. She also leads the team in steals with 32, is tied for the team lead in assists with 64, and is second on the team and ninth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 6.1 average.</p>\n<p>Just last week, King became the 11<sup>th</sup> player in Hawaii program history to record career totals of 1,000 points and 500 rebounds. She is currently nine assists away from becoming the fifth Rainbow Wahine player ever to register career totals of 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, and 250 assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to match her effort and intensity on the glass and get her off the glass,” Henrickson said. “You can’t underestimate how hard she plays, you look at her free-throws, and she has 12. You’re getting to the free-throw line because you’re driving it, rebounding it, running in transition, and getting opportunities on the block. In all of those areas is where she got us.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara prepares to face the conference’s top rebounding team, which averages 41.8 per game, the post presence of junior center Je Zhe Newton will be important for the Gauchos at both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>In 26 minutes of play in the first matchup versus the Rainbow Wahine, Newton tallied a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. However, she has not scored over three points in five of the team’s last seven games despite grabbing 12 rebounds in the Gauchos’ 58-55 loss to LBSU.</p>\n<p>“She brings size, there’s no doubt about that” Henrickson said. “She’s got to work to catch the ball and get position where she can receive the ball and finish. Certainly we have to find her; she’s got to protect the rim and defensively rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game of the season at Hawaii will tip-off at 9 p.m. PST and 7 p.m. HST</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/","id":351,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[350,349,348],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Cruise Past UCI 66-37, Come Up Short in 66-60 Loss to Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team remains in the middle of the pack of the Big West Conference Standings after splitting its pair of games against UCI on Thursday and Cal Poly on Saturday.

Despite recording a season-high 53.8 three-point percentage, UCSB nearly matched its season-high total of 27 turnovers it set in its first meeting against the Mustangs with 24 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara still managed to register a 42. 9 field goal percentage, narrowly edged by the Mustangs’ 44.4 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>An early 5-2 lead in the game’s beginning was the only time UCSB led in Saturday’s game. The small margin would not last as the Mustangs’ 60 percent shooting percentage along with a 9-1 run helped it to take an 18-15 lead to end the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was most productive in the second quarter, outscoring UCSB 19-9 to enter halftime with a double-figure lead 37-24. At the helm of the Mustangs’ scoring attack in the first half was sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe, scoring 14 of her game-high 20 points in the first two quarters. She closed out the first half with back-to-back three-pointers as she finished with 10 points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, providing UCSB with points was guards senior Jasmine Ware and junior Onome Jemerigbe. The two combined for 16 of the Gauchos’ 24 first half points. Ware led UCSB in scoring with 14 points, while Jemerigbe concluded Saturday with 11 points and a game-high five assists. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr finished with 10 points and a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs gained their largest lead of 14-points at the 9:25 mark of the third quarter with a 40-26 lead.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB brought its deficit within single-figures. A layup by sophomore forward Taylor Farris trimmed Cal Poly’s lead to an eight-point margin of 55-47. The basket sparked UCSB’s 7-0 run, bringing the Gauchos within three, 52-55.</p>\n<p>Following a layup by Cal Poly junior forward Hannah Gilbert, Farris answered with a three-pointer to bring UCSB within its closest deficit of two points at 55-57.</p>\n<p>As the momentum gradually shifted in favor of the Gauchos, a dagger from beyond the arc by senior guard Beth Balbierz handed Cal Poly a 60-55 lead with 36 seconds remaining in the game. She was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 14 points on 2-3 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UCSB fouled the Mustangs in the game’s remaining seconds in hope of completing its combeack, but Cal Poly shot a perfect 6-6 from the free-throw line in the final quarter to secure its 66-60 victory.</p>\n<p>While a total of four different Gauchos scored double-figures in points, UCSB’s starting lineup struggled in its matchup versus UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 42.4 percent from the field, Ware was the Gauchos only double-figure scorer with a game-high 17 points off the bench.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara didn’t have any illustrious individual performances Thursday night, its 53 rebounds was the most it recorded in a conference game this season. UCSB outrebounded UCI 53-30, helping result in the Gauchos outscoring the Anteaters 26-8 in the paint and 15-4 on second chance points.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Thursday’s victory was one of UCSB’s best defensive performances of the season as it held UC Irvine to 31.0 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages. The Gauchos held UCI to just four points twice in the second and fourth quarters.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCSB prevented all UCI players from scoring within double-figures as the Anteaters leading scorer was freshman guard Andee Ritter.</p>\n<p>Farris tied her career-high of 13 rebounds in Thursday’s 66-37 win over UCI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 3 at Hawaii at 9 p.m. HST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":350,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[349,348,347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sisterly Ties: From the Court to the Heart","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=801%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Put into perspective is the influence of family, specifically her older sister Afure, in the life of third-year point guard Onome Jemerigbe of the UCSB women's basketball team.

But it’s great having multiple siblings. I’ve always loved the fact that there’s always multiple people to talk to; it’s like having three best friends.”</p>\n<p>Of those three best friends, the relationship with her only sister, Afure, developed into a relatability beyond the ties of lineage, for it also revolved on the basketball court.</p>\n<p>“She’s [Afure] definitely one of the biggest influences I have as a person and for the reasons why I play basketball,” Onome explained. “She started off playing basketball when she was young. Me being the youngest, I always kind of copied my older siblings, so I kind of followed her into it. Her love for the game influenced me to even try out for basketball.”</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, Afure’s love for the game of basketball didn’t develop without the persistence of a valiant effort that was committed to improving everyday. Nonetheless, Onome served as a constant reminder in ensuring Afure displayed her best at all times.</p>\n<p>“I have always had an incredible love for the game. It was that love that made playing basketball so much fun for me,” Afure said. “I truly believe that Onome plays the way that she does, with so much heart and passion because she too has this love for the sport.”</p>\n<p>Afure attended and played basketball for St. Mary’s High School from 2006-2010. She ranked No. 15 on ESPN HoopGurlz 100 list during her senior year and was a 2010 McDonald’s All-American.</p>\n<p>When Afure was a senior at St. Mary’s, Onome was a freshman. While it was one of the few opportunities for the two to play together, Afure made sure to cherish her last year both being around and playing with her sister.</p>\n<p>“When baby sis played with me for a year during her freshman year in high school, my senior year, I loved it,” she said. “I could watch over her. Make sure she was doing her homework especially on the road games. She was the point guard and could see things from a perspective that I couldn’t, and as a wing guard and an experienced athlete, I could see things that she couldn’t. We have always had such a fun, goofy and close sister to sister relationship. I consider her to be my best friend. I want her to always be the best person that she can be, and I knew that it in order for her to be that, that it started with me. It started with me because I am her older sister and she looked up to me. We were always around each other.”</p>\n<p>Yet their time together would end with Afure attending and playing basketball at the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating in 2014, she played one season overseas in Spain for Al-Qazeres women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It is through these experiences in which Afure has been able to help guide Onome throughout her career. Specifically, helping enhance Onome’s capabilities both on and off the court is most paramount.</p>\n<p>“From playing at Cal and then going to play overseas, I learned the importance of good character. Character is what is deep inside us; it’s who we are on a daily basis, when things go well and when things go wrong,” Afure said. “It’s who we are in the locker room, on the court as well as in the classroom. We have reason to be proud when both reputation and character are a mirror image of each other.”</p>\n<p>As Onome was in her first year at UCSB, Afure was a senior preparing to conclude her collegiate career at Cal. Although the two sisters were members of opposing programs, Afure helped integrate Onome into the duties and responsibilities of being a collegiate student-athlete.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the stuff she [Afure] went through has helped me to become a better player,” Onome said. “I’m not the perfect player, but I’ve definitely grown because of her. She explained what she should have done, all the mistakes she made. It helps me to not make the same mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Currently in her third year at UCSB as the floor general for the Gauchos’ women’s basketball team, Onome has had an immediate impact on the court since her arrival. Thus far, she has started in 79 of 86 career games played, having started all 29 games her sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Her performance through the years has resulted in her being named to the 2013-14 All-Big West Freshman Team, and she was an Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient last season.</p>\n<p>So far this year, Onome has excelled since the start of the Big West Conference schedule, leading the conference in assists per game with a 5.4 average while ranking second in steals per game with 2.1.</p>\n<p>She also set career-highs in scoring with 20 points at UC Davis and 11 assists versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>While her individual accolades do not surpass the team’s long-term goals and the role she plays in them, Onome accredits her maturation as a person to her production on the court.</p>\n<p>“Freshman year, I was easily bothered,” she said. “Not to say that I don’t get bothered every once in a while, but I’ve definitely grown in the mental part of basketball. Just being able to control my emotions and make sure I give my all every time despite if I have turnovers or if we weren’t being successful as a team.”</p>\n<p>While Onome continues to impress on the court and owes much appreciation to Afure for inspiring her love of the game in addition to providing advice on life as a collegiate student-athlete, true inspiration for both sisters begins with their mother. An immigrant from Nigeria who persevered and raised four children, Onome acknowledges her mother as the constant reminder to continue to work hard each day.</p>\n<p>“My mother keeps me balanced, keeps my head straight,” Onome said. “She always seems to know what to say to get me back on track.”</p>\n<p>It has been the existence of this family foundation that has contributed to the person Onome is both on and off the court. According to her, the core to this foundation originates with one word: loyalty.</p>\n<p>“They’re the people that are going to be there for you when times are hard and when times are good,” Onome said. “You can always rely on them to support you and be there for you.”</p>\n<p>Afure has epitomized this essence of loyalty all along, and is now just attempting to replicate the same support system that was provided to her.</p>\n<p>“Home is where heart is. Family is the epicenter of all reasons. Family to me is root of my very existence,” she said. “Without family we wouldn’t be the people that we are today.”</p>\n<p>While basketball helped to further establish the relationship between sisters Onome and Afure, it never defined their bond.</p>\n<p>Once the shot clock hits zero and it’s time to hand in your jersey, the temporary reality of basketball is realized, but family is forever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’ve got to be as good as we’ve been all year. Be more discipline, [against CSULB] we gave up middle drives, didn’t communicate switches, and turned the ball over too many times.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tonight game with an overall record of 10-17, 7-6 in the Big West. The Gauchos sit at fifth in the conference standings, narrowly trailing UCD, who is currently in fourth at 8-5. UC Irvine is clinging onto its eighth-place position with its 8-22 and 1-11 conference record. It owns just one less loss than CSUF, who is 1-12 in the Big West. Cal Poly is 13-14 overall and 6-8 in Big West play for sixth-place, attempting to bounce back from its 61-56 loss to Long Beach State last night.</p>\n<p>In store for the Gauchos are two opponents with similar playing styles that revolve around their frontcourts. This week’s games will be UCSB’s second meeting against both teams. Santa Barbara will hope to establish a better defensive effort after allowing field goal percentages above 40 percent against both opponents earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB will attempt to contain the interior presence of UCI’s duo of junior forwards Mokun Fajemisin and Shereen Sutherland.</p>\n<p>Fajemisin’s rebounding and blocking abilities are most challenging when facing the Anteaters. In addition to ranking fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game at 7.6, her average of 2.2 blocks per game leads the conference. Fajemisin will come into tonight’s matchup with a streak of at least two blocks in the past four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>While Sutherland’s averages of 21. 8 minutes and 7.8 points per game aren’t astounding, her versatile skillset of post offense and mid-range shooting can be difficult to defend.</p>\n<p>“[Fajemisin] really bothered us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “Sutherland is a really talented kid who just didn’t have much rhythm there. She got some step away [opportunities] and pulled Je Zhe away from the basket. We fouled too much. It will be important for us to pressure defensively, force tough twos, and rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ended its first matchup against UCI with 24 personal fouls, sending the Anteaters to the free-throw line where they went 16-23.</p>\n<p>In just 24 minutes played, Fajemisin led the Anteaters with 16 points on 6-13 shooting from the floor while adding six rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Sutherland will look to improve her three foul performance in which she had one point at the free-throw line in 14 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing a 40. 4 opponent field goal percentage against the Anteaters in the first meeting, UCSB recorded its third-best shooting performance of the season at 54.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe with a career-high 20 points along with a combined 33 points from junior center Je Zhe Newton and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the Gauchos will look to confine the Anteaters’ offense tonight, which has struggled on the road averaging just 54.1 ppg and a 32.5 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following UCSB’s final home game, it will begin its two-game road trip at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short in the team’s Senior Day celebration last weekend, UCSB will hope to send out its senior group— Jasmine Ware, Dioseline Lopez, and Kendra Morrison— with one last victory over its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>“We beat them at home, that was the first time I ever beat them in all my four years here so that was good,” Ware said. “It would be even better to beat them at home, at their place. We just have to take care of business at home, then worry about the road. From here on out its just one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ pursuit of sweeping the season series against the Mustangs will be intense as they prepare to face one of the best defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly currently leads the conference in opponent field goal percentage, limiting offenses to a 37.2 average percentage.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs’ defense has helped to stifle opponents, their offense has yet to truly discover a consistent source of scoring. However, emerging in the team’s last three game has been senior guard Beth Balbierz. She has averaged 21.0 ppg over the Mustangs’ last three contests and is second on the team in scoring with 12.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Cal Poly’s offense is junior forward Hannah Gilbert in the paint. She leads the Mustangs with 13.0 ppg, is third in the Big West in rebounds per game with an 8.7 average, and is second in field goal percentage at 53.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tip-off will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. in the Robert A.

We forced her middle to her left hand which is where she wants to go and it’s an And-1. Just undisciplined.”</p>\n<p>Hope remained on the UCSB sideline as junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe dashed coast to coast for the game-tying layup with 10 seconds to send the game into overtime. But the Gauchos’ comeback chances were ended when 49ers’ junior forward Madison Montgomery rejected the layup attempt prompting the game’s ending with a 58-55 LBSU victory after a made free-throw by junior guard Anna Kim.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 10-17 overall and 7-6 in the Big West. Long Beach State improved to 19-7 and 8-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss made the race for a top-four seed in the Big West Conference standings more challenging for the Gauchos as they missed out on the opportunity to tie the 49ers for fourth-place. In addition to UC Davis losing to UCR, Long Beach State was able to move up to third-place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>However, during Saturday’s post-game interview, Coach Henrickson assured the media that the team’s standing was the least of her worries with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>“The best thing we could have done was beat Long Beach [Saturday],” Henrickson said. “I’ve looked at the format, but I need to focus on us playing better. I don’t get caught up in all of that. If we play well, all that will take care of itself.”</p>\n<p>The format of the Big West Tournament permits the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds to skip the first two rounds of the tournament onto the semifinal. As for the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds, they are granted a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that UCSB will earn a No. 1 or No. 2 seed at this point in the season, but the Gauchos could possibly earn the No. 3 seed or a likely No. 4 seed as UC Davis sits ahead of UCSB in fourth-place at 8-5 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>With low-scoring totals from both teams, the largest lead of Saturday’s game was from Long Beach by a deficit of seven. Three points was the largest scoring differential by quarters as the 49ers narrowly outscored UCSB 16-13 in the third period.</p>\n<p>No player in UCSB’s starting lineup finished with double-figures in points, leaving the offensive duties to the Gauchos’ reserves off the bench.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB was more efficient shooting the ball than LBSU amassing a 45.2 field goal percentage to the 49ers’ 36.2 percentage. Santa Barbara was able to surpass the 49ers’ full-court press and 2-3 zone defense, but still had 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“I thought the press was better at their place,” Henrickson said. “But how many of those [turnovers] are unforced? Travel, dribble pick-ups, and throwing it out of bounds. It’s just undisciplined. That’s my responsibility, I’ve got a role in that as well. They [LBSU] can turn us over, but we turned ourselves over.”</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara in points was senior guard Jasmine Ware with 16 points as she nearly registered her first-career triple-double tallying eight assists and six rebounds as well. Adding to the Gauchos’ production off the bench was Newton, who recorded her second double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Newton’s 6-6 performance at the free throw line in the first half provided the majority of points in Santa Barbara’s 10-2 run, giving it a 27-25 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>In spite of its momentum to close out the first half, UCSB was sluggish in the second half and failed to contain LBSU in the opening of the third quarter, allowing the 49ers to go on a 9-0 run to take a 34-27 lead.</p>\n<p>“I thought we were terrible and we were up by two,” Henrickson said. We had no pop, no energy. [It shows] how consistent you have to be, how well you have to play, and how hard you have to play every single night. We’re not flying around, it’s quiet… that’s frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB’s 5-0 scoring run after calling a timeout trimmed its deficit to two at 32-34.</p>\n<p>Two quick fouls during the first quarter led to Benton playing in just three minutes of the first half as she sat out the entirety of the second quarter, having taken no shot attempts in the first half.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, Benton erupted for all 19 of her points in the second half. She scored the 49ers’ last 11 points of the third quarter and had eight points in the fourth quarter. She concluded Saturday shooting 7-11 from the field and went 5-6 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>The 49ers entered Saturday’s matchup shooting over 35 percent from beyond the arc in conference play, but were contained to a 23.5 three-point percentage, going 4-17 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, draining two pivotal three-pointers was sophomore guard Gigi Hascheff. She finished the game with 11 points and at one point with 4:47 remaining in the game it was her shot form long-range that handed LBSU a 52-51 lead.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to gain the lead twice after Hascheff’s three-pointer, Benton’s scoring outburst was too much for the Gauchos to contain as she led the 49ers to their 58-55 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in its last home game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 25 versus UC Irvine at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68501\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68501\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/","id":347,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[346,345,344],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Makes It Four Straight With Win Over UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos continued their hot run to improve to 7-5 in conference play and are now two games out of second place.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68455\" style=\"width: 251px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68455\" data-attachment-id=\"68455\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/eric-childress-drives-into-the-paint-for-a-layup-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Childress drives into the paint for a layup.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Thanks to a pestering presence on defense, forcing 24 points off 20 turnovers, and a 21-point outing from guard Gabe Vincent, the UCSB men’s basketball team extended its winning streak to four games at home on Saturday night beating UC Davis for the second straight time with a final score of 62-55.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing is getting a lot scrappier,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have this four game winning streak and we’ve only had one good shooting night [aside from Cal State Fullerton]. Our defense, energy, and everything about us is getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, which was 3-5 and in sixth place in conference to begin the month of February, now improves to 7-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 13-12. The Gauchos are two games back from second place UC Irvine and Long Beach State, both hosting a Big West record of 9-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies, 10-16 overall, lose their fourth straight game and drop to a conference record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten back over the break even mark and that’s a very good thing,” Williams stated. “I thought we played really hard tonight. We didn’t shoot well, which they had a lot to do with, but we played very hard.”</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t the cleanest first half for either team, committing a total of 21 turnovers, the Gauchos jumped out to a 31-20 advantage at halftime due to the shooting hand of Vincent. The shooting guard out of Stockton, CA went 4-7 from the field scoring seven of his teams first 13 points. Vincent led all scorers at the break with 10 points.</p>\n<p>Drawing two early fouls and struggling to find his rhythm offensively, senior guard Michael Bryson made his presence known in other categories during the first half. The 6’4” wing recorded seven rebounds, two blocks, and three steals. Bryson also hit home six of his teams seven free throws in the first period, going a perfect six-for six behind the free throw stripe.</p>\n<p>Facing an uphill battle similar to their match on Thursday, the Aggies clawed their way back in the second half this time from 11-points. Davis shaved the Gauchos’ lead down to five with 18:27 to go as junior Brynton Lamar finished strong to the rack and then followed it up with a mid-range jump shot to have his team trail 26-31.</p>\n<p>The third year guard finished second in scoring for Davis on Saturday, one point shy of senior Josh Fox’s team-high 17 points. Not only Lemar keep the game within reach scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half, the San Diego, CA native earned himself a double-double crashing the boards on offense and defense for a total of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong effort from Fox and Lemar, the Gauchos ended the game in dramatic fashion as junior guard Eric Childress led a 3-on-2 break and dished a no-look pass to Vincent for the go-ahead dunk with 1:02 remaining. Vincent’s slam magnified UCSB’s lead to 10 after that point.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also had a major boost from its bench, including a 9-point contribution from senior forward Mitch Brewe. The 6’8” senior scored seven of his nine points in the first half and helped add to the Gauchos’ season-high 13 steals with two picks.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to bring a lot of energy physicality, and a big defensive presence [tonight],” Brewe said. “I didn’t do a good job of finishing in the beginning of the game but [afterwards] got in a rhythm a little bit. I think coming off the bench bringing a lot of energy and keeping the level high is really important.”</p>\n<p>“It was a team win for everybody tonight,” said Childress. “We just knew we had to make plays.[Davis] is a physical team and when we have a night like this when we’re not shooting well we have to be aggressive back with them and our bench came in and did that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has outscored its opponents’ bench in each of its last four games, averaging 20.5 points per game. This is a reasonable chunk of their 70.1 point average per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sets foot on its two-game road trip this week starting with a Thursday night match against Cal State Northridge and a Saturday game at Fullerton. The Gauchos game at CSUN will take place in the Matadome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":348,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[347,346,345],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Able to Earn Third-Straight Victory, Win 65-55 on the Road at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the Big West Conference Tournament rapidly approaching, the UCSB men's basketball team is starting to play its best basketball at the right moment.

Seniors Guard Michael Bryson and forward John Green led the way for UCSB, scoring 11 of the team’s first 15 points to help set the Gauchos up with a 15-6 lead prompting them to never trail at any point of Thursday’s contest.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored the first six points for UCSB, including a layup just 18 seconds into the game. Green came off the bench in attack mode, hitting a mid-range jumper and three-pointer all within the 11<sup>th</sup> minute of the first half. The two went 7-11 from the floor in the first half, playing a major role in UCSB’s 29-18 advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior guard T.J. Taylor also added the exclamation point with seven seconds left in the first. Off a UCR turnover, Taylor went coast-to-coast maneuvering past a defender and hit a buzzer-beating three with one second to spare.</p>\n<p>Taylor tied season-highs with eight points and four assists in nineteen minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders had their troubles in the first half, shooting 7-28 from the field, guards Gentrey Thomas and Jaylen Bland helped turn things around. Riverside chipped at its 11-point deficit as Thomas connected on a three-point shot followed by a strong finish to the rim. This five-point swing helped pull the score to 32-30 with 16:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Helping bring UCR within the Gauchos’ lead was the Highlanders’ senior captain in Bland. With 6:40 left in regulation, Bland knocked down his 100<sup>th</sup> three-pointer of the season, a Big West best, to trim UCSB’s lead to 50-44 with 6:40 to go.</p>\n<p>While Bland entered Thursday with the fourth-best scoring average in the Big West of 16.5 points per game, the Murray State transfer did not have the most efficient shooting night from the floor, going 4-15 overall and 3-11 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Bland has had a rocky scoring stretch during his past three games, averaging 8.3 points per game including a 1-8 shooting night and season-low five points against Cal Poly on Feb. 13.</p>\n<p>With the Highlanders quickly on its heels, Santa Barbara converted at the free-throw line going 11-12 in the final six minutes to secure its victory. Overall, UCSB went 18-25 from behind the free-throw line, including the reliable foul shooting of senior forward Sam Beeler, who hit four of his six made free-throws in the last five minutes of play.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Johns, the Highlanders relied heavily on junior forward Secean Johnson to keep UCR within reach.

After splitting their pair of games last week with an 80-62 win over UCI and a 60-52 loss to Long Beach State, the Gauchos prepare for rematches versus Cal State Northridge tonight and LBSU on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Chasing UCSB are the Matadors in sixth-place at 6-18, 4-6 in the Big West. They were defeated by UCSB 65-49 in the first meeting between the two teams two weeks ago. The 49ers managed to redeem their first road loss of the conference season at Hawaii, which ended their five-game winning streak, with their victory over UCSB last weekend. LBSU ranks fourth in the Big West with an 18-6 overall and 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a 2-12 start in its non-conference schedule, it seemed like the reigning conference tournament champions were destined for a first-round exit in the postseason. Although the Matadors remain below the .500 mark in Big West play, they could be the ‘cinderella’ story of this year’s tournament in March.</p>\n<p>Central to CSUN’s improvements in the second half of the season has been the emergence of freshman center Channon Fluker. After starting in just one game during the non-conference portion of the season averaging 6.6 points per game and 6.5 rebounds per game, Fluker has been one of the most dominant post players since the start of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Recently, Fluker has recorded seven consecutive double-doubles and is averaging 20.8 points and 13.9 rebounds per game. Through 10 Big West games, she has led CSUN with 16.7 ppg and 12.4 rebounds per game. Both conference averages lead the Big West thus far.</p>\n<p>She didn’t start in the Matadors’ first meeting against the Gauchos, and finished with eight points on 3-8 shooting and a game-high 15 rebounds in 26 minutes of play. While the addition of Fluker to the team’s starting lineup may make a difference, the Matadors hope to avoid another inefficient shooting night. Overall, CSUN shot 19-53 (35.8 percent) and 3-13 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc in the Feb. 3 meeting.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, it was a phenomenal shooting night for the Gauchos, posting their third best three-point shooting performance of the season at 42.9 percent. Nonetheless, Santa Barbara notched a 45.8 field goal percentage to complement its long-range shooting.</p>\n<p>Contributing to the Gauchos’ fluent shooting from behind the perimeter and from other areas of the court was senior guard Jasmine Ware. Although she attempted just one shot from deep, she registered a game-high 17 points on an 8-11 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will attempt to recover its tremendous three-point shooting after an 18.2 field goal percentage from beyond the arc last Saturday at LBSU. However, ensuring that it contains Fluker will be the Gauchos’ main priority entering tonight.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s home stand is its rematch versus Long Beach State Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will seek to rally back from its worst shooting night from the field (28.8 percent) and from behind the three-point line (18.2 percent) in a conference game this season in its loss to the 49ers. Once again, UCSB will have to endure Long Beach State’s stout defense which leads the Big West and ranks 13<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 21.3 turnovers forced per game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB forced 21 turnovers last Saturday, it allowed Long Beach State to capitalize on points off turnovers at a greater pace of 25-17 in which the Gauchos turned the ball over 18 times. After netting a career-high 20 points, four assists and four steals in the team’s win over UCI, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe was responsible for six of UCSB’s 18 turnovers against LBSU.</p>\n<p>Benefitting from the 49ers’ advantage in points off turnovers were junior forward Madison Montgomery and junior guard Raven Benton. Both finished with 15 points and were precise with their shot selection. Montgomery shot 7-11 from the field, while Benton went 5-6 to go along with three steals.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to possibly defeat LBSU, not only will it need to reduce its amount of turnovers, but it will need more production from its bench. The Gauchos were outscored 24-13 in bench points while Roper was the only player on the team to notch double-figures in scoring with 16 points on a rough 4-14 shooting afternoon. Despite 21 minutes from Ware and 26 minutes from senior guard Dioseline Lopez, the two combined for 11 points on 4-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB managed to tie the game at a score of 48-48 in the fourth quarter, it lacked a consistent source of offense to secure a victory.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game versus CSUN will begin at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will welcome Long Beach State to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 20 and face the 49ers at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/","id":343,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[342,341,340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Overcomes Sluggish First Quarter, Emerges for 70-58 Win Over CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 24-6 run in the second quarter of Thursday's game versus Cal State Northridge helped guide the UCSB women's basketball team to its 70-58 victory over the Matadors Thursday night.

Northridge fell to 6-19 overall, 4-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>After scoring its first field goal at the 9:30 mark of the game, UCSB was unable to score its next basket until 3:40 remained in the first quarter. While UCSB struggled shooting the ball, CSUN managed to go on a 15-2 run. Helping establish this run was Fluker with nine points in the first quarter as CSUN ended the first period with a 20-6 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being held to just six points in the first quarter, UCSB answered with some lockdown defense of its own, holding CSUN to just six points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>“We put good pressure on the guards on the perimeter and made things uncomfortable,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Our double was good. We turned [Fluker] over three times, got a travel. Just to be disruptive always creates some offense from defense.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara forced 24 turnovers, recorded 14 steals, and outscored CSUN in points off turnovers 30-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ stout defense helped to resolve their cold shooting start to begin the game as they went on a 7-0 run to open the second period which brought them within a single-figure deficit of 13-20. As UCSB’s scoring run expanded, it ended the second quarter outscoring CSUN 24-6. Prompting UCSB’s scoring stretch was its improvement from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>After going scoreless from beyond the arc in the first 10 minutes of Thursday’s game, Santa Barbara sunk four of its six three-pointers in the second quarter. Igniting the Gauchos’ long-range shooting was freshman guard Coco Miller with two three-pointers. She concluded Thursday with 13 points on a 5-13 overall and 2-7 three-point shooting effort.</p>\n<p>A make from behind the perimeter by senior guard Dioseline Lopez brought the Gauchos within one-point of CSUN’s lead at 22-23.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 0-5 three-point shooting start in the first quarter, UCSB remained committed to its shot selection from beyond the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“I always tell those two [Roper and Miller] to shoot until your arm falls off,” Henrickson said. “Even if you’ve missed three or four, we all expect the next one to go and they have to have that mentality.”</p>\n<p>With a 27-26 lead, it was a three-pointer at the buzzer by Roper that shifted the momentum to UCSB’s advantage while extending the Gauchos’ lead to 30-26 at the half.</p>\n<p>“It all started with our defense, especially because we had a slow start,” Roper said. “Coach [Henrickson] really emphasized pressure on the defensive end in getting us better looks on offense.”</p>\n<p>Roper capitalized off the buzzer shot, scoring UCSB’s first field goal of the second half from beyond the arc while her last three-point basket of the game with 1:15 in the third handed the Gauchos their first double-figure lead of the game at 46-36.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the game, Northridge trailed by a double-figure deficit. Its ability to get to the free-throw, where it made 11-14 in the second half, did not permit it to keep up with UCSB’s scoring pace.</p>\n<p>Although Fluker registered 19 of her 31 points in the second half, the Matadors were overcome by the Gauchos’ 51.6 field goal percentage in the final two quarters. In addition to Roper and Miller, senior guard Jasmine Ware’s 5-10 shooting performance and total of 10 points off the bench helped UCSB secure its 70-58 victory.</p>\n<p>Next on UCSB’s schedule is Long Beach State this Saturday, Feb. 20 at 2 p.m. The 49ers endured an 83-58 loss to UC Riverside Thursday night, bringing them to 18-7 overall and 7-4 in conference play. UCSB, currently in fifth-place of the Big West standings, could tie LBSU for fourth-place in the conference with a victory on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/","id":345,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[344,343,342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Extend Streak Against UCR, Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team is fourth in the Big West standings with a 5-5 conference record and is could reach the .500 mark overall with a win over UCR tonight.

Aside from the 29 combined points that sophomore guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Michael Bryson tallied home, Bob Williams accredits this victory to a collective team effort from other players on his squad.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial when other guys make contributions offensively for us [because] it turns us into a much more efficient team,” Williams said. “John Green was alive … Sam Beeler was really effective [on the floor], and Eric Childress continues to be money shooting the ball from the three-point line. This gives us a lot of balance because opponents are going to pay a lot of attention to Michael and Gabe.”</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos shot a season-high 23-26 from the free-throw line last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB will have to contain the senior duo of forward Taylor Johns and guard Jaylen Bland. The two are the best frontcourt-backcourt combo in the conference, combining for 32 points per game, Bland at 16.5 and Johns at 15.5.</p>\n<p>Johns carried the Highlanders in their 78-86 loss to Cal Poly last week. The senior scored a game-high 25 points in 38 minutes, also tallying his fifth double-double of the season with 10 boards.</p>\n<p>While Bland only scored five points in his last match, he and Johns have scored 20-plus or more points in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>Looking to avenge their six-point loss last Thursday and upset UCSB at home, junior guard and Darius Graham and senior forward Josh Fox will play pivotal roles Saturday night against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Graham is coming off a big game against the Gauchos scoring a game-high 19 points while going 3-4 from downtown. The 5-10” floor general has shown signs of being an offensive threat, leading Davis in scoring five times this season including a 21-point outing in its 58-55 win against Riverside.</p>\n<p>Big man Josh Fox will try and compliment Graham’s guard play down low in the post. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, the forward has been having an unforgettable senior campaign leading all Aggies in scoring with 14.2 per game and field goal percentage with 51.5 percent. Fox has led his team in scoring 10 times this season while scoring 17 or more points in ten occasions.</p>\n<p>With regard to last Thursday at UC Davis, a conference win was not the only achievement Coach Williams accomplished against his former team. Coaching the Aggies from 1990-1998, the three-time Big West Coach of the Year collected his 299th win last Thursday.</p>\n<p>While this milestone is a notable one, just one victory shy of being the 3rd coach ever in conference to eclipse the 300-win mark, Williams says at this point it is just a number.</p>\n<p>“The win at Davis meant a lot to me because it was home for eight years … but I’m just not attached to the number of accumulated wins at this stage in my life,” Williams stated. “Maybe 10 years from now when I’m reading through a scrapbook that will be something that means something to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face UCR tonight at 8 p.m. UCSB returns to action in the Thunderdome this Saturday, Feb. 20 versus UC Davis, which is set for a 7 p.m. tip-off time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’re trying to look at press offense this week leading into it.”</p>\n<p>After a 25-point performance in UCSB’s rout of CSUF, Makala Roper seemed to have regained her scoring touch. However, the sophomore guard followed up her performance with six points and a 2-14 shooting effort in the team’s loss to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Scoring in double-figures in six of the Gauchos’ nine conference games this season, Roper has become the go-to scorer for UCSB since being moved to the starting lineup. Including last Saturday’s loss, in four of five games following a 20-plus point performance, she has registered single-figures in scoring.</p>\n<p>With the Big West Conference Tournament approaching, Roper is hoping to become a more consistent scorer for UCSB on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“Taking the game slower and step by step” Roper explained. “Not rushing anything, just letting it flow — it all starts in practice.”</p>\n<p>Occupying the Gauchos’ game plan heading into Thursday’s contest is their strategy to combat the Anteaters’ size and depth.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of dribble moves,” Henrickson said. “It’s not a traditional sit down deep, pivot and score [offense]. It’s get off the block a little bit, face you, rip and drive, back you down and spin. There’s a lot of dribbling involved and its multiple moves. So our bigs have got to stay down and keep their feet alive.”</p>\n<p>Despite the versatility within their frontcourt, the Anteaters haven’t had much production offensively this season. Overall, they rank last in field goal percentage at 34.4 percent, three-point percentage at 22.3 percent and their average of 12.1 assists per game ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Irvine’s defense has emerged during its lack of offense. The Anteaters have held three of their last four opponents under 60 points and recently allowed a season-low 50 points in their loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A central figure within UCI’s stout defense has been the play of Mokun Fajemisin. A junior forward, Fajemisin grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds and had two blocks against the Mustangs. Her total of 40 blocks and 2.0 rejections per game leads the Big West. In addition, Fajemisin ranks fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 7.7 average and a total of 154 rebounds this year.</p>\n<p>Her blocking abilities have influenced the rest of the team since the start of Big West play as the Anteaters lead the conference with an average of 4.6 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Finding a way to combat UCI’s size will be most important for the Gauchos, who are depleted in size this season.</p>\n<p>Closing out UCSB’s road trip is its matchup against Long Beach State. The 49ers are coming off of a 22-10 season last year in which they put together a 15-game winning streak at one point, but faltered during the conference schedule as they finished with a 9-7 record.</p>\n<p>LBSU was knocked out of the first round of the Big West Conference Tournament by CSUF, then loss in the first round of the WNIT to San Diego.</p>\n<p>In the midst of a five-game winning streak and in second place, the 49ers may be in route to a strong finish to conference play. Thus far, it has been Long Beach’s defense that has led it to such a solid start.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ average of 21.5 turnovers forced per game leads the Big West and ranks 12th in the nation. Despite nearly being upset and allowing 71 points in an overtime win at CSUN, Long Beach State has held 12 opponents to 60 points or fewer and five to under 50 points this season.</p>\n<p>Complementing the 49ers’ defense is their shooting from behind the three-point line. They rank third in the Big West in three-point percentage at 32 percent. Most notably, LBSU set a single-game program and Big West record of 20 three-pointers made in its 82-61 victory at CSUF.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UCI is set for 7 p.m. tonight at the Bren Events Center. The Gauchos game at LBSU will take place on Saturday, Feb. 13 at 4 p.m. in Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 11, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/","id":340,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[339,338,337],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Resurgent Second Half Performance Earns 81-68 Win vs. CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 54 points scored in the second half helped the UCSB men's basketball team to overcome a seven-point deficit coming out of halftime.

The Gauchos responded with improved energy and effort coming out of halftime, outhustling Fullerton in statistical categories that included rebounding, assists, field goal percentage, and ball possession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara controlled the pace of the game in every facet of the second half— shooting 66 percent from the field and 77 percent from downtown while it contained the Titans for the majority of Saturday’s contest, holding CSUF to a dismal overall field goal percentage of 38 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on their trips to the line as well, making 13-17 on the night from behind the stripe to finish with a 76.5 free-throw percentage, a major improvement from their 53.8 percent outing against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Influencing UCSB’s improvement on offense in the second half was its ability to penetrate the Titans’ defense when driving the ball.</p>\n<p>“We got great space off of our drives [in the second half],” Williams said. “Our penetration created open shots for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB was poised when handling the ball. It concluded Satuday’s game with just nine turnovers, a total below the Gauchos’ season average of 13.3 per game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Eric Childress played a major role in UCSB’s victory Saturday night, registering only one turnover in the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Childress, learning from his six point and five turnover performance last Thursday against Hawaii, was aggressive with his attack which provided a much-needed boost behind scoring threats Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson. The Hawthorne, CA native finished with 13 points and seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>“Eric was shooting the ball under great control and had great poise,” Williams said. “He looked so in control of his game offensively and it really caused problems for Fullerton’s guards.”</p>\n<p>Childress’ control of the ball also resulted in more scoring opportunities for Vincent and Bryson. The two tallied 45 points Saturday night, 20 for the sophomore guard and 25 for the senior Bryson. It was an efficient shooting night for Vincent as he finished 7-15 from the floor and made a game-high 5-7 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be aggressive and look for shots to attack,” Vincent said. “We can always get shots up from the perimeter, I was hitting the three tonight, but I was really trying to get out in transition and get to the rim.”</p>\n<p>Bryson also flirted with a triple-double, grabbing a game-high nine rebounds and tying Childress’ game-high of seven assists. His 25-point performance helped him to climb to eighth-place on the Gauchos’ all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>Young players like Jarriesse Blackmon contributed quality minutes this weekend as well. While the freshman forward did not score in his nine minutes of action, the Salt Lake City native pulled down a career-high eight boards for his team, five of them offensive rebounds giving UCSB second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>“[Jarriese] is not afraid of the moment and not afraid to try and make plays,” Williams stated. “He’s a high energy guy and that’s what we needed out of him tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hope to take Saturday’s home victory and use its momentum for the team’s two-game road trip starting at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“[We need to take] the energy, enthusiasm, and accountability we played with tonight into next week,” Williams said. “[Our guys] understand that we’ve dug ourselves a whole and the only way to get out of it is by playing hard and playing better.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to the Pavillion on Thursday, Feb. 11 to face the Aggies. Tip-off will take place at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Yet, UCSB rebounded in the second half shooting 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Unlike UCSB, Hawaii established its offensive presence and was successful as it shot 45.8 percent from the field in the first two quarters. It was most efficient shooting the ball in the first period of Saturday’s game. The Rainbow Wahine registered a 61. 5 shooting percentage and closed the quarter on a 9-2 run to take a 16-9 lead.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch extended to a 14-2 run to open the second quarter which handed Hawaii a double-figure lead of 22-9.</p>\n<p>Despite the absence of its primary scorers, UCSB’s bench played a pivotal role in its gradual comeback prior to entering halftime. Junior center Je Zhe Newton tallied her first double-double of the season with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii was in route to widening the scoring gap between it and UCSB, a three-pointer by senior guard Dioseline Lopez energized UCSB’s performance on the court in addition to trimming Hawaii’s lead to a five-point deficit.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points of the second quarter was senior guard Jasmine Ware. She ended Saturday with 10 points in 29 minutes while going 3-6 shooting the ball and 4-4 from the free-throw line. Still, Hawaii entered halftime with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in its comeback effort in the second half was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She shot a perfect 3-3 from the field in the third quarter to go along with three assists and six points. Jemerigbe led UCSB in scoring with 13 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the third quarter on a 7-0 run which expanded into an 11-2 run in the beginning of the fourth quarter, resulting in UCSB taking a 45-41 lead. It was a high-scoring fourth quarter as the two teams combined for 44 points.</p>\n<p>Three lead changes and two ties occurred within the fourth quarter. Although both teams exchanged baskets, it was Karaitiana that provided the edge for UCSB. Prior to her game-winning three-pointer, she had seven points in the quarter and made her only three-pointers of the game in the final period to help lead the Rainbow Wahine to their 63-62 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Davis this Thursday, Feb. 11 and will face the Aggies in the Bren Events Center at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68000\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68000\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/","id":391,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[390,389,388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Unable to Maintain Tempo in Second Half, Lose 76-64 to Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-12.05.2014-1-of-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-12.05.2014-1-of-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team was unable to capitalize on its momentum of handing UCI its first Big West loss of the season.

Vincent tallied in nine of UCSB’s first 15 points, scoring the first bucket of the game off a spot up three-pointer. The Stockton native shot 4-6 in the half.</p>\n<p>Despite only trailing 36-33 at the half, UCSB was unable to find its groove offensively shooting 11-34 from the field including 5-19 from downtown. A stagnant offense and 14 turnovers propelled Hawaii to an 11-4 run over UCSB, extending the Rainbow Warriors’ lead to 47-40 with 13:45 remaining. Hawaii never trailed after this point in the game.</p>\n<p>While neither team was able to establish an offensive presence until five minutes remained in the second half, Coach Williams was not pleased with his team’s lack of energy.</p>\n<p>“Two of the last three games [at home] we’ve come out with minimal effort and its unacceptable,” Williams said. “It’s hard to explain why you would have better energy [on the road] than in your own house.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently 1-3 this year in conference games when playing in the Thunderdome. While UCSB has managed to find its rhythm against tough teams on the road, it hasen’t had the best record as of late defending home court.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we feed off the crowd on the road, or maybe it’s an us-against-the-world attitude, but either way we are definitely a better team away from home,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Despite a tough loss, freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak made his presence known down low. In his 13<sup>th</sup> start of the season, the 6’7” forward battled it out with Hawaii’s frontcourt of  Mike Thomas and Stefan Jankovic, finishing with six points off 3-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>While his stat line wasn’t the greatest, Kupchak came up clutch when his team needed him finishing at the rim within closing seconds of the first half slicing the lead to three. Kupchak also had another strong drive with 7:46 to play, pulling his team to a 56-54 deficit.</p>\n<p>“Max is a real smart player, his basketball IQ is very high especially for a freshman,” Vincent said of his fellow teammate. “He knows how to play the game so we’ve been getting some good minutes from him especially with John [Green] going down. We need more from [Max] and it will come.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii also took advantage of its trips to the free-throw line, scoring 22 points behind the stripe compared to seven for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge their loss this Saturday, Feb. 6 as they will face Cal State Fullerton. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/","id":371,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[370,369,368],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pummel CSUF in 79-49 Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-12-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team ended its two-game losing streak with a 79-49 rout of Cal State Fullerton Wednesday night.

The Titans are 2-20 overall and remain winless in conference play at 0-8.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Signs of a big night from Roper was evident early as she scored 15 points on 6-9 shooting from the field, 3-5 from behind the three-point line in the first quarter. It was a strong offensive start for Jemerigbe as well as her total of eight point in Wednesday’s game all appeared in the opening quarter on 3-3 shooting.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s efficient shooting start to the game resulted in it registering 61.1 field goal and 55.6 three-point percentages, contributing to its 18-6 run to end the quarter with a 28-11 lead.</p>\n<p>A slight decline in the Gauchos’ shooting to begin the second quarter influenced the Titans’ 7-2 scoring stretch. A run sparked by a three-pointer by freshman forward Michelle Berry nearly brought Fullerton within a 10-point deficit of the Gauchos’ lead at 18-30.</p>\n<p>Although Berry led the Titans in scoring with 17 points, the three-point make in the second quarter was her lone field goal from beyond the arc. Despite entering Wednesday night ranked second in the Big West in total three-pointers made, Fullerton shot 5-13 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Five points in the second period helped Roper end the first half with 20 points as the Gauchos went into halftime with a 46-26 lead.</p>\n<p>Guaranteeing UCSB’s victory was its 22-8 outscoring of the Titans in the third quarter. Leading UCSB’s offensive surge to start the second half was Miller with seven points while Roper secured her game-high total with five points in the quarter. Senior guard Jasmine Ware tallied six of her 12 points in the quarter as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it was the Gauchos’ prowess on defense that was most effective. Santa Barbara restrained CSUF to a 27.3 field goal percentage while also holding the Titans scoreless for the remaining 5:50 of the period.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which CSUF managed to outscore UCSB 15-11. Complementing Berry was freshman guard Dani Craig, who finished as the Titans only other player to score in double-figures with 11 points.</p>\n<p>But the Gauchos went on to earn their largest lead in the game at the 4:51 mark of the fourth quarter to take a 77-38 lead, eventually defeating the Titans 79-49.</p>\n<p>Aiding the UCSB in its containment of Fullerton’s three-point shooting was its conference game-high total of 44 rebounds in which the Gauchos grabbed a conference game-best of 28 defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawaii this Saturday at 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Rainbow Wahine were projected to finish in first place of the conference standings in the Big West Preseason Poll. They currently are tied with UCSB for fourth in the Big West standings with a 5-3 record, but have a chance to end the tie in their game at Cal Poly tonight.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67935\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/gauchos-pummel-csuf-in-79-49-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67935\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/gauchos-pummel-csuf-in-79-49-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/gauchos-pummel-csuf-in-79-49-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/gauchos-pummel-csuf-in-79-49-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/gauchos-pummel-csuf-in-79-49-victory/","id":370,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[369,368,367],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":21,"route":"/categories/sports/basketball","highestPage":52}},"__N_SSG":true}
